Which health care workers can provide medical abortion services?,"Abortions are safe when they are carried out with a method that is recommended by WHO and that is appropriate to the pregnancy duration, and when the person carrying out the abortion has the necessary skills.In addition to non-specialist and specialist doctors, a wide range of health worker cadres – such as auxiliary nurses, auxiliary nurse midwives, nurses, midwives, associate/ advanced associate clinicians, pharmacists and doctors of complementary
    medicine – can provide various aspects of medical abortion services."
Can medical abortion be self-managed by the client herself?,"When using the combination mifepristone and misoprostol regimen, the medical abortion process can be self-managed for pregnancies up to 12 weeks of gestation, including the ability to take the medications at home, without direct supervision of a health-care
    provider."
Is an ultrasound routinely required for the provision of abortion?,"Ultrasound scanning is not routinely required for the provision of abortion. A physical examination to assess uterine size, determine the last menstrual period and identify symptoms of pregnancy are usually adequate."
Can unsafe abortions be prevented?,"Unsafe abortions can be prevented through: Comprehensive sexuality educationPrevention of unintended pregnancy through use of effective contraception, including emergency contraceptionProvision of legal safe abortion. A safe abortion is an abortion carried out with a method that is recommended by WHO and that is appropriate to the pregnancy duration; and for which the person carrying out the abortion has the necessary skills."
What is a refractive error?,"A refractive error is a very common eye disorder. It occurs 
when the eye cannot clearly focus the images from the outside world. The
 result of refractive errors is blurred vision, which is sometimes so 
severe that it causes visual impairment.
		The four most common refractive errors are:myopia (nearsightedness): difficulty in seeing distant objects clearly;hyperopia (farsightedness): difficulty in seeing close objects clearly; astigmatism: distorted vision resulting from an irregularly curved cornea, the clear covering of the eyeball.presbyopia: which leads to difficulty in reading or seeing at 
arm's length, it is linked to ageing and occurs almost universally.Refractive errors cannot be prevented, but they can be 
diagnosed by an eye examination and treated with corrective glasses, 
contact lenses or refractive surgery. If corrected in time and by 
eye-care professionals, they do not impede the full development of good 
visual function. Correction is provided in different forms according to 
the defect, the age f the person, the requirements in terms of work of 
activity performed.

WHO estimates that 153 million people worldwide live with 
visual impairment due to uncorrected refractive errors. This figure does
 not include the people living with uncorrected presbyopia, which is 
likely to be quite significant, according to some early evidence.WHO, its Member States and partners are working to find ways 
to provide good quality, professionally prescribed, local, affordable 
corrective  refraction services to people in need, especially in poor 
areas with limited eye care services.Related linksBlindness and Vision"
Up to what age can a baby stay well nourished by just being breastfed?,"Infants should be exclusively breastfed – i.e. receive only breast milk – for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. ""Exclusive breastfeeding"" is defined as giving no other food or drink – not
    even water – except breast milk. It does, however, allow the infant to receive oral rehydration salts (ORS), drops and syrups (vitamins, minerals and medicines). Breast milk is the ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants;
    breastfeeding is also an integral part of the reproductive process with important implications for the health of mothers.WHO recommends that infants start receiving complementary foods at six months (180 days) of age in addition to breast milk. Foods should be adequate, meaning that they provide sufficient energy, protein and micronutrients to meet a growing child's nutritional
    needs. Foods should be prepared and given in a safe manner to minimize the risk of contamination. Feeding young infants requires active care and stimulation to encourage the child to eat.The transition from exclusive breastfeeding to full use of family foods is a very vulnerable period. It is the time when many infants become malnourished, contributing significantly to the high prevalence of malnutrition in children under five years of
    age worldwide. It is essential therefore that infants receive appropriate, adequate and safe complementary foods to ensure the right transition from the breastfeeding period to the full use of family foods.Amounts of foods to offerAgeTextureFrequencyAmount at each meala6–8 monthsStart with thick porridge, well mashed foodsContinue with mashed family foods2–3 meals per day, plus frequent breastfeedsDepending on the child's appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offeredStart with 2–3 tablespoonfuls per feed, increasing gradually to ½ of a 250 ml cup9–11 monthsFinely chopped or mashed foods, and foods that baby can pick up3–4 meals per day, plus breastfeedsDepending on the child's appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered½ of a 250 ml cup/bowl12–23 monthsFamily foods, chopped or mashed if necessary3–4 meals per day, plus breastfeedsDepending on the child's appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered¾ to full 250 ml cup/bowl    a Note: If baby is not breastfed, give in addition: 1–2 cups of milk per day, and 1–2 extra meals per day."
"Why can’t we give water to a breastfeeding baby before the 6 months, even when it is hot?","Giving water to young babies puts them at risk of diarrhoea and
 malnutrition. Water may not be clean and cause the baby to have 
infections. Giving water may also cause the baby to drink less 
breastmilk or to stop breastfeeding early and therefore cause 
malnutrition. If mothers give water instead of breastfeeding it will 
also cause the mother to have less milk in the future. 
		Breast milk is more than 80% water, especially the first milk 
that comes with each feed. Therefore, whenever the mother feels her baby
 is thirsty she can breastfeed him or her. This will satisfy the bay’s 
thirst, and continue to protect the baby from infections, and help the 
baby to continue to grow well. Babies do not need water before they are 6
 months old, even in a hot climate. This is one of the reasons that WHO 
recommends for children to be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 
months of life.A child is considered exclusively breastfed when he or she 
receives only breast milk, without any additional food or liquid, even 
water, with the exception of oral rehydration solution, drops, syrups of
 vitamins, minerals or medicines.  When breastfeeding, the mother gives 
her baby all the water he or she needs, while providing “safe water” and
 protecting the baby against diarrhoea.  Related LinksPromoting proper feeding for infants and young childrenGlobal Strategy for Infant and Young Child FeedingThe WHO Child Growth Standards"
What do you consider as red meat?,"Red meat refers to all mammalian muscle meat, including, beef, veal, pork, lamb, mutton, horse, and goat."
What do you consider as processed meat?,"Processed meat refers to meat that has been transformed 
through salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or other processes to 
enhance flavour or improve preservation. Most processed meats contain 
pork or beef, but processed meats may also contain other red meats, 
poultry, offal, or meat by-products such as blood.Examples of processed meat include hot dogs (frankfurters), 
ham, sausages, corned beef, and biltong or beef jerky as well as canned 
meat and meat-based preparations and sauces."
Why did IARC choose to evaluate red meat and processed meat?,"An international advisory committee that met in 2014 recommended 
red meat and processed meat as high priorities for evaluation by the 
IARC Monographs Programme. This recommendation was based on 
epidemiological studies suggesting that small increases in the risk of 
several cancers may be associated with high consumption of red meat or 
processed meat. Although these risks are small, they could be important 
for public health because many people worldwide eat meat and meat 
consumption is increasing in low- and middle-income countries. Although 
some health agencies already recommend limiting intake of meat, these 
recommendations are aimed mostly at reducing the risk of other diseases.
 With this in mind, it was important for IARC to provide authoritative 
scientific evidence on the cancer risks associated with eating red meat 
and processed meat."
"What are the safest methods of cooking meat (e.g. sautéing, boiling, broiling, or barbecuing)?","Cooking at high temperatures or with the food in direct contact 
with a flame or a hot surface, as in barbecuing or pan-frying, produces 
more of certain types of carcinogenic chemicals (such as polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic amines). However, there 
were not enough data for the IARC Working Group to reach a conclusion 
about whether the way meat is cooked affects the risk of cancer."
Is eating raw meat safer?,"There were no data to address this question in relation to cancer 
risk. However, the separate question of risk of infection from 
consumption of raw meat needs to be kept in mind."
"Red meat was classified as Group 2A, probably carcinogenic to humans. What does this mean exactly?","In the case of red meat, the classification is based on 
limited evidence from epidemiological studies showing positive 
associations between eating red meat and developing colorectal cancer as
 well as strong mechanistic evidence.Limited evidence means that a positive association has been 
observed between exposure to the agent and cancer but that other 
explanations for the observations (technically termed chance, bias, or 
confounding) could not be ruled out."
Why should I donate blood?,"Safe blood saves lives and improves health. Blood transfusion is needed for:women with complications of pregnancy, such as ectopic pregnancies and haemorrhage before, during or after childbirth;children with severe anaemia often resulting from malaria or malnutrition;people with severe trauma following man-made and natural disasters; andmany complex medical and surgical procedures and cancer patients.It is also needed for regular transfusions for people with conditions such as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease and is used to make products such as clotting factors for people with haemophilia.There is a constant need for regular blood supply because blood can be stored for only a limited time before use. Regular blood donations by a sufficient number of healthy people are needed to ensure that safe blood will be available whenever and wherever it is needed.Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person — the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components — red cells, platelets and plasma — which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions."
"Processed meat was classified as Group 1, carcinogenic to humans. What does this mean?","This category is used when there is sufficient evidence of 
carcinogenicity in humans. In other words, there is convincing evidence 
that the agent causes cancer. The evaluation is usually based on 
epidemiological studies showing the development of cancer in exposed 
humans.In the case of processed meat, this classification is based on
 sufficient evidence from epidemiological studies that eating processed 
meat causes colorectal cancer."
Processed meat was classified as carcinogenic to humans(Group 1). Tobacco smoking and asbestos are also both classified as carcinogenic to humans(Group 1). Does it mean that consumption of processed meat is as carcinogenic as tobacco smoking and asbestos?,"No, processed meat has been classified in the same category as 
causes of cancer such as tobacco smoking and asbestos (IARC Group 1, 
carcinogenic to humans), but this does NOT mean that they are all 
equally dangerous. The IARC classifications describe the strength of the
 scientific evidence about an agent being a cause of cancer, rather than
 assessing the level of risk."
What types of cancers are linked or associated with eating red meat?,"The strongest, but still limited, evidence for an association with
 eating red meat is for colorectal cancer. There is also evidence of 
links with pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer."
What types of cancers are linked or associated with eating processed meat?,"The IARC Working Group concluded that eating processed meat causes
 colorectal cancer. An association with stomach cancer was also seen, 
but the evidence is not conclusive."
How many cancer cases every year can be attributed to consumption of processed meat and red meat?,"According to the most recent estimates by the Global Burden of
 Disease Project, an independent academic research organization, about 
34 000 cancer deaths per year worldwide are attributable to diets high 
in processed meat.Eating red meat has not yet been established as a cause of 
cancer. However, if the reported associations were proven to be causal, 
the Global Burden of Disease Project has estimated that diets high in 
red meat could be responsible for 50 000 cancer deaths per year 
worldwide.These numbers contrast with about 1 million cancer deaths per 
year globally due to tobacco smoking, 600 000 per year due to alcohol 
consumption, and more than 200 000 per year due to air pollution."
Could you quantify the risk of eating red meat and processed meat?,"The consumption of processed meat was associated with small 
increases in the risk of cancer in the studies reviewed. In those 
studies, the risk generally increased with the amount of meat consumed. 
An analysis of data from 10 studies estimated that every 50 gram portion
 of processed meat eaten daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer 
by about 18%.The cancer risk related to the consumption of red meat is more
 difficult to estimate because the evidence that red meat causes cancer 
is not as strong. However, if the association of red meat and colorectal
 cancer were proven to be causal, data from the same studies suggest 
that the risk of colorectal cancer could increase by 17% for every 100 
gram portion of red meat eaten daily."
"Is the risk higher in children, in elderly people, in women, or in men? Are some people more at risk?",The available data did not allow conclusions about whether the risks differ in different groups of people.
What about people who have had colon cancer? Should they stop eating red meat?,The available data did not allow conclusions about risks to people who have already had cancer.
Should I stop eating meat?,"Eating meat has known health benefits. Many national health 
recommendations advise people to limit intake of processed meat and red 
meat, which are linked to increased risks of death from heart disease, 
diabetes, and other illnesses."
How much meat is it safe to eat?,"The risk increases with the amount of meat consumed, but the data 
available for evaluation did not permit a conclusion about whether a 
safe level exists."
What is WHO’s health recommendation to prevent cancer risk associated with eating red meat and processed meat?,"IARC is a research organization that evaluates the evidence 
available on the causes of cancer but does not make health 
recommendations as such. National governments and WHO are responsible 
for developing nutritional guidelines. This evaluation by IARC 
reinforces a 2002 recommendation from WHO that people who eat meat 
should moderate the consumption of processed meat to reduce the risk of 
colorectal cancer. Some other dietary guidelines also recommend limiting
 consumption of red meat or processed meat, but these are focused mainly
 on reducing the intake of fat and sodium, which are risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease and obesity. Individuals who are concerned about 
cancer could consider reducing their consumption of red meat or 
processed meat until updated guidelines related specifically to cancer 
have been developed."
Should we eat only poultry and fish?,The cancer risks associated with consumption of poultry and fish were not evaluated.
Should we be vegetarians?,"Vegetarian diets and diets that include meat have different 
advantages and disadvantages for health. However, this evaluation did 
not directly compare health risks in vegetarians and people who eat 
meat. That type of comparison is difficult because these groups can be 
different in other ways besides their consumption of meat."
Is there a type of red meat that is safer?,"A few studies have investigated the cancer risks associated with 
different types of red meat, such as beef and pork, and with different 
kinds of processed meats, like ham and hot dogs. However, there is not 
enough information to say whether higher or lower cancer risks are 
related to eating any particular type of red meat or processed meat."
"Could the preservation method influence the risk (e.g. salting, deep-freezing, or irradiation)?","Different preservation methods could result in the formation of 
carcinogens (e.g. N-nitroso compounds), but whether and how much this 
contributes to the cancer risk is unknown."
How many studies were evaluated?,"The IARC Working Group considered more than 800 different studies 
on cancer in humans (some studies provided data on both types of meat; 
in total more than 700 epidemiological studies provided data on red meat
 and more than 400 epidemiological studies provided data on processed 
meat)."
How many experts were involved in the evaluation?,The IARC Working Group consisted of 22 experts from 10 countries.
What actions do you think governments should take based on your results?,"IARC is a research organization that evaluates the evidence on the
 causes of cancer but does not make health recommendations as such. The 
IARC Monographs are, however, often used as a basis for making national 
and international policies, guidelines and recommendations to minimize 
cancer risks. Governments may decide to include this new information on 
the cancer hazards of processed meat in the context of other health 
risks and benefits in updating dietary recommendations."
What is avian influenza?,"Avian influenza viruses normally spread between birds. However, some viruses have been found to infect humans.When avian influenza infects humans, symptoms may range from 
mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to severe pneumonia, 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (difficulty breathing), shock and 
even death."
Who is at risk for avian influenza?,"The primary risk factor for humans is exposure to infected 
live or dead poultry or contaminated environments, such as live bird 
markets. Slaughtering, defeathering, handling carcasses and preparing 
poultry for consumption, especially in household settings, are also risk
 factors.Although human-to-human transmission of avian influenza is 
thought to have occurred in some instances when there had been close or 
prolonged contact with a patient, no sustained human-to-human 
transmission has been identified to date."
How can human infections with avian influenza be prevented?,"As much as possible, residents and travellers in countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza in birds should avoid:poultry farmscontact with animals in live poultry marketsentering areas where poultry may be slaughteredcontact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animalsconsumption of raw or incompletely cooked meat or eggs.Good food safety and hand hygiene practices should also be followed, including regular handwashing with soap and water."
What should you do if you think someone may have avian influenza?,"Seek medical care immediately if you live in or have recently 
visited an area experiencing an outbreak and you are suffering flu-like 
symptoms such as fever, cough and difficulty breathing.If you or someone close is experiencing flu-like symptoms, take protective measures:Regular handwashing with proper drying of the handsGood respiratory hygiene – covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, using tissues and disposing of them correctlyEarly self-isolation of those feeling unwell, feverish and having other symptomsAvoid close contact with people with respiratory symptoms"
"Is it safe to eat meat or animal products, such as eggs, from areas with outbreaks of avian influenza?","Meat products and eggs can be safely consumed, provided they 
are properly prepared because influenza viruses are inactivated by 
thorough cooking. Please see ""How can meat and eggs be safely prepared?” for detailed information. Consuming raw or incompletely cooked meat and eggs from areas 
experiencing outbreaks of avian influenza is high-risk and should be 
avoided. Likewise, animals that are sick or have died unexpectedly 
should not be eaten."
Does stopping a course of antibiotics early lead to antibiotic resistance?,"There has been a lot of research into how long antibiotic 
courses should be, to determine the shortest possible length of course 
needed to completely kill all bacteria.
		If you are being treated for an infection, the kind of 
antibiotics your doctor prescribes and the length of the course should 
be based on the best evidence.Feeling better, or an improvement in symptoms, does not always
 mean that the infection has completely gone. Your doctor has had years 
of training and has access to the latest evidence – so always follow 
their advice. Evidence is emerging that shorter courses of antibiotics may 
be just as effective as longer courses for some infections. Shorter 
treatments make more sense – they are more likely to be completed 
properly, have fewer side effects and also likely to be cheaper. They 
also reduce the exposure of bacteria to antibiotics, thereby reducing 
the speed by which the pathogen develops resistance. WHO publishes guidelines about treatments for different 
infections and recommends treatment durations and doses of antibiotics 
based on the best clinical evidence for each case. We continuously 
review the latest research so that we can provide updated 
recommendations to health professionals."
How can meat and eggs be safely prepared?,"To avoid contamination, always keep raw meat and eggs separate from
 cooked or ready-to-eat foods. Do not use the same chopping board or the
 same knife for raw meat and other foods, and do not place cooked meat 
back on the same plate or surface it was on before cooking. After 
handling raw meat, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Do 
not eat raw or soft-boiled eggs. Wash and disinfect all surfaces and 
utensils that have been in contact with raw meat."
Is it safe to visit live poultry markets and farms?,"To avoid contamination, always keep raw meat and eggs separate from
 cooked or ready-to-eat foods. Do not use the same chopping board or the
 same knife for raw meat and other foods, and do not place cooked meat 
back on the same plate or surface it was on before cooking. After 
handling raw meat, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Do 
not eat raw or soft-boiled eggs. Wash and disinfect all surfaces and 
utensils that have been in contact with raw meat."
Is there a vaccine against avian influenza?,"No vaccine for the prevention of avian influenza infections in
 humans is commercially available. WHO is working with partners on 
vaccine development. Some products are already being tested for efficacy
 and safety.The seasonal influenza vaccine does not prevent avian 
influenza, but it may reduce the likelihood of being simultaneously 
infected with both avian and seasonal influenza viruses (dual 
infections). Reducing dual infections decreases the likelihood of 
viruses gaining the ability to spread easily from person to person."
Is it safe to travel to areas reporting human cases of avian influenza?,"WHO does not recommend travel restrictions related to avian 
influenza. However, travellers can take certain measures to reduce the 
risk of infection. Please see ""How can human infections with avian influenza be prevented?"""
What is antimicrobial resistance?,"Antimicrobial resistance occurs when microorganisms such as 
bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change in ways that render the 
medications used to cure the infections they cause ineffective. When the
 microorganisms become resistant to most antimicrobials they are often 
referred to as “superbugs”. This is a major concern because a resistant 
infection may kill, can spread to others, and imposes huge costs to 
individuals and society. 

		Antimicrobial resistance is the broader term for resistance in
 different types of microorganisms and encompasses resistance to 
antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic and antifungal drugs. Antimicrobial resistance occurs naturally but is facilitated 
by the inappropriate use of medicines, for example using antibiotics for
 viral infections such as cold or flu, or sharing antibiotics. 
Low-quality medicines, wrong prescriptions and poor infection prevention
 and control also encourage the development and spread of drug 
resistance. Lack of government commitment to address these issues, poor 
surveillance and a diminishing arsenal of tools to diagnose, treat and 
prevent also hinder the control of antimicrobial drug resistance."
What is the difference between antibiotic and antimicrobial resistance?,"Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria change in response
to the use of antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections (such as
urinary tract infections, pneumonia, bloodstream infections) making them
ineffective.
Antimicrobial resistance is a broader term, encompassing
resistance to drugs that treat infections caused by other microbes as
well, such as parasites (e.g. malaria or helminths), viruses (e.g. HIV)
and fungi (e.g. Candida)."
Why is vaccination important for addressing antibiotic resistance?,"Vaccines can help limit the spread of antibiotic resistance.
		The global increase in disease caused by drug-resistant 
bacteria, due to overuse and misuse of antibiotics, is a major public 
health concern. It is more difficult and costly to treat 
antibiotic-resistant infections and people do not always recover.Vaccinating humans and animals is a very effective way to stop
 them from getting infected and thereby preventing the need for 
antibiotics.
Making better use of existing vaccines and developing new 
vaccines are important ways to tackle antibiotic resistance and reduce 
preventable illness and deaths."
How can existing vaccines have an impact?,"Expanding the use of existing vaccines will reduce the use of antibiotics and the development of resistance.
		For example, if every child in the world received a vaccine to protect them from infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae
 bacteria (which can cause pneumonia, meningitis and middle ear 
infections), this would prevent an estimated 11 million days of 
antibiotic use each year.Vaccines against viruses, such as the flu, also have a role to
 play, because people often take antibiotics unnecessarily when they 
have symptoms such as fever that can be caused by a virus."
How can new vaccines have an impact?,"Developing and using new vaccines to prevent bacterial diseases can further reduce the development of resistance.
		Antibiotics are currently the standard medical intervention for common diseases such as Group A Streptococcus (which causes “strep throat”), for which we do not yet have vaccines.We also need vaccines to stop people from catching diseases 
caused by bacteria that are now frequently antibiotic-resistant. For 
example, there is an alarming spread of multi-drug resistant 
tuberculosis (MDR-TB). In 2015, an estimated 480 000 people were 
infected with MDR-TB.Similarly, new vaccines targeting Staphylococcus aureus (which causes skin and soft tissue infections), Klebsiella pneumoniae (which causes pneumonia and infections of the blood stream and urinary tract), Clostridium difficile
 (which causes diarrhoeal disease), and many others could protect people
 against diseases that are increasingly difficult to treat.Developing new vaccines and getting them used appropriately is
 lengthy and complex. The scientific community needs to prioritise which
 new vaccines would have the greatest impact on antibiotic resistance, 
and promote investment in these."
What is ‘herd immunity’?,"‘Herd immunity’, also known as ‘population immunity’, is a concept used for vaccination, in which a population can be protected from a certain virus if a threshold of vaccination is reached.
Herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not by exposing them to it.
Vaccines train our immune systems to create proteins that fight disease, known as ‘antibodies’, just as would happen when we are exposed to a disease but – crucially – vaccines work without making us sick. Vaccinated people are protected from getting the disease in question and passing it on, breaking any chains of transmission. Visit our webpage on COVID-19 and vaccines for more detail.
With herd immunity, the vast majority of a population are vaccinated, lowering the overall amount of virus able to spread in the whole population. As a result, not every single person needs to be vaccinated to be protected, which helps ensure vulnerable groups who cannot get vaccinated are kept safe.
The percentage of people who need to have antibodies in order to achieve herd immunity against a particular disease varies with each disease. For example, herd immunity against measles requires about 95% of a population to be vaccinated. The remaining 5% will be protected by the fact that measles will not spread among those who are vaccinated. For polio, the threshold is about 80%.
Achieving herd immunity with safe and effective vaccines makes diseases rarer and saves lives.
Find out more about the science behind herd immunity by watching or reading this interview with WHO’s Chief Scientist, Dr Soumya Swaminathan."
What is WHO’s position on ‘herd immunity’ as a way of fighting COVID-19?,"Attempts to reach ‘herd immunity’ through exposing people to a virus are scientifically problematic and unethical. Letting COVID-19 spread through populations, of any age or health status will lead to unnecessary infections, suffering and death.
The vast majority of people in most countries remain susceptible to this virus. Seroprevalence surveys suggest that in most countries, less than 10% of the population have been infected with COVID-19.
We are still learning about immunity to COVID-19. Most people who are infected with COVID-19 develop an immune response within the first few weeks, but we don’t know how strong or lasting that immune response is, or how it differs for different people. There have also been reports of people infected with COVID-19 for a second time.         
Until we better understand COVID-19 immunity, it will not be possible to know how much of a population is immune and how long that immunity last for, let alone make future predictions. These challenges should preclude any plans that try to increase immunity within a population by allowing people to get infected.
Although older people and those with underlying conditions are most at risk of severe disease and death, they are not the only ones at risk.
Finally, while most infected people get mild or moderate forms of COVID-19 and some experience no disease, many become seriously ill and must be admitted into hospital. We are only beginning to understand the long-term health impacts among people who have had COVID-19, including what is being described as ‘Long COVID.’ WHO is working with clinicians and patient groups to better understand the long term effects of COVID-19.  
Read the Director-General’s opening remarks at the 12 October COVID-19 briefing for a summary of WHO’s position."
What do we know about immunity from COVID-19?,"Most people who are infected with COVID-19 develop an immune response within the first few weeks after infection.
Research is still ongoing into how strong that protection is and how long it lasts. WHO is also looking into whether the strength and length of immune response depends on the type of infection a person has: without symptoms (‘asymptomatic’), mild or severe. Even people without symptoms seem to develop an immune response.
Globally, data from seroprevalence studies suggests that less 10% of those studied have been infected, meaning that the vast majority of the world’s population remains susceptible to this virus.
For other coronaviruses – such as the common cold, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) – immunity declines over time, as is the case with other diseases. While people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus develop antibodies and immunity, we do not yet know how long it lasts. 
Watch this conversation with Dr Mike Ryan and Dr Maria Van Kerkhove for more information on immunity."
What is WHO’s position on ‘lockdowns’ as a way of fighting COVID-19?,"Large scale physical distancing measures and movement restrictions, often referred to as ‘lockdowns’, can slow COVID‑19 transmission by limiting contact between people.
However, these measures can have a profound negative impact on individuals, communities, and societies by bringing social and economic life to a near stop. Such measures disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups, including people in poverty, migrants, internally displaced people and refugees, who most often live in overcrowded and under resourced settings, and depend on daily labour for subsistence.
WHO recognizes that at certain points, some countries have had no choice but to issue stay-at-home orders and other measures, to buy time.
Governments must make the most of the extra time granted by ‘lockdown’ measures by doing all they can to build their capacities to detect, isolate, test and care for all cases; trace and quarantine all contacts; engage, empower and enable populations to drive the societal response and more.
WHO is hopeful that countries will use targeted interventions where and when needed, based on the local situation."
Will over-use of alcohol-based handrubs result in resistance?,"Unlike other antiseptics and antibiotics, there is no reported or likely resistance to alcohol-based handrubs. Indeed, the more it is appropriately used, the less antibiotic-resistant bacteria are able to spread."
Does alcohol dry the hands or sting when applied?,"Modern alcohol-based handrubs should not (if used correctly) dry the hands. Some staff may be familiar with the generation of alcohol-based handrubs which contained no skin softeners (emollients). Today’s handrubs all contain skin softeners which help prevent drying. Of the published studies available, many describe that nurses who routinely use alcohol rubs have less skin irritation and dryness than those using soap and water. Alcohol handrubs will sting if the staff member has any cuts or broken skin. Such areas should be covered with waterproof plasters. Allergic contact dermatitis due to alcohol-based handrubs is very rare."
How many times can staff use the alcohol rubs?,"There is a common misconception that hands should be washed after every four or five applications of alcohol-based handrub. There is no reason to do this, other than personal preference in some cases (i.e. if hands feel like they need washing or in hot and highly humid climates)."
"Since launching the Guidelines, are you aware off any problems with patients or staff drinking the product?","There have been some reports in the UK and USA of patients drinking alcohol-based handrubs. This is clearly a concern when considering large-scale implementation of these handrubs, and risks should be satisfactorily addressed. A thorough risk assessment should be undertaken. If this is considered to be a risk, these risks can be reduced by issuing staff with handrubs rather than placing them around the bed space. Alternatives include alcohol-based handrub formulation to be locked in wall dispensers. These are the strategies commonly employed in facilities where small children are being cared for. It is important to ensure that placement of the handrubs is targeted at the points of care. Many of the risks associated with alcohol-based handrubs can be further minimized by sensible location of the bottles, aligned with the Five Moments and point of care philosophy."
Are health care staff adversely affected in any way by the alcohol when cleaning their hands?,"There is no evidence to suggest this. Published studies to date have shown that after using the handrubs, alcohol levels found in the blood are insignificant (ethanol) or not detectable (iso-propyl)."
What advice do you have in light of the reports that some countries are considering banning ethanol due to theoretical harmful effects caused by inhalation?,"On the basis of current evidence, both ethanol and isopropanol are safe to use for hand hygiene. The World Alliance for Patient Safety through its Global Patient Safety Challenge programme has established a Task Force of experts to address this issue and to research and verify the potential consequences of ethanol. The Guidelines are being pilot-tested to determine the efficiency of recommendations. The Task Force for investigating the potential harm of ethanol is compiling data on this. Some specific studies have looked at inhalation of ethanol and this has resulted in some countries reviewing its use. However, for hand hygiene, due to the limited time of exposure alcohol is not absorbed in measurable quantities. . In the unlikely event that the Task Force finds ethanol use should be limited, then this formulation will not be recommended by the WHO. The Guidelines will be finalized before the end of 2008."
What are the fire hazards relating to alcohol-based hand rub?,"All alcohol based products are potentially flammable and therefore they should be stored away from high temperatures and flames. The WHO suggests that all health-care organisations currently using alcohol-based handrub should undertake local risk assessments. The benefits of the alcohol in terms of infection prevention far outweigh the fire risks . A study in Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (Kramer et al 2007) found that hand rubs have been used in many hospitals for decades, representing an estimated total of 25,038 hospital years of use. The median consumption was between 31 L/month (smallest hospitals) and 450 L/month (largest hospitals), resulting in an overall consumption of 35 million L for all hospitals. A total of 7 non-severe fire incidents were reported. No reports of fire caused by static electricity or other factors were received, nor were any related to storage areas."
What can be done to minimize fire risks?,"The control of fire risks requires a co-ordinated approach by fire officers, fire safety advisors, risk managers, health & safety, and infection control professionals, and involves the risk assessment of points of use and storage, as well as general
    safety requirements. Risk assessments should be carried out on the use of alcohol handrubs, the location of dispensers, the storage of stock and the disposal of used containers/dispensers and expired stock, giving consideration to the risks of fire.Allow the handrub to dry: Staff should be advised to let their hands dry and the vapours disperse after using alcohol handrub, which minimises these risks. The How to Handrub posters state clearly: ""once dry, your hands are safe"".StorageIn order to avoid running out of handrub, ward areas and clinical units may hold reserve stock locally. Local and central (bulk) storage must comply with fire regulations regarding the type of cabinet and store, respectively. Production and storage facilities should ideally be air-conditioned or cool rooms.No open flames or smoking should be permitted in these areas.The WHO–recommended formulation handrub should not be produced in quantities exceeding 50 L locally, or in central pharmacies lacking specialized air conditioning and ventilation.Since undiluted ethanol is highly flammable and may ignite at temperatures as low as 10oC, production facilities should directly dilute it to the concentrations outlined in the Guide.The flash points of ethanol 80% (v/v) and isopropyl alcohol 75% (v/v) are 17.5°C and 19°C, respectively.National safety guidelines and local legal requirements must be adhered to, in regard to the storage of ingredients and the final product.Care should be taken when carrying personal containers/dispensers to avoid spillage onto clothing, bedding, or curtains, and in pockets, bags or vehicles.Containers / dispensers should be stored in a cool place, and care should be taken regarding the securing of tops / lids. The quantity of handrub kept in a ward or department should be as small as is reasonably practicable for day-to-day purposes. A designated ‘Highly Flammables’ store will be required for situations where it is necessary to store more than 50 L (e.g. central bulk storage). Containers and dispenser cartridges containing handrub should be stored in a cool place away from sources of ignition. This also applies to used containers that have not been rinsed with water. Disposal issuesUsed containers and dispensers will contain gel residues and flammable vapours.Rinsing out used containers with large quantities of cold water will reduce the risk of fire and the containers may then be recycled or disposed of in general waste. Location of dispensersHandrub dispensers should not be placed above or close to potential sources of ignition, such as light switches and electrical outlets, or next to oxygen or other medical gas outlets, due to the increased risk of vapours igniting. Handrub dispensers should not be sited in any corridor that forms part of a means of escape (i.e. outside the ward). Fire Safety Advisors may need to be consulted. If dispensers are placed in a circulation area within a ward (e.g. outside bedded areas)
        it is recommended that they are at least 1.2 metres apart, the circulation area is at least 2 metres wide and the maximum container size is 1 litre. The siting of handrub dispensers above carpets is not recommended due to the risk of damage and lifting/warping of carpets. Consideration should be given to the risks associated with spillage onto floor coverings, including the risk of pedestrian slips. This advice is based on a Fire Modelling Analysis Report prepared for the American Society for Healthcare Engineering (ASHE) in the US in 2003. Regions should check with local regulatory agencies for specific guidelines.Patients and visitorsClear instructions for use should be displayed at handrub dispenser points intended for use by visitors to clinical areas. These should include warnings not to use excessive amounts, and not to smoke immediately after use. SpillagesSignificant spillages should be dealt with immediately by removing all sources of ignition, ventilating the area and diluting with water (to at least ten times the volume).The fluid should then be absorbed by an inert material such as dry sand (not a combustible material such as sawdust) which should then be disposed of in a chemical waste container. Vapours should be dispersed by ventilating the room (or vehicle) and the contaminated item should be put in a plastic bag until it can be washed and/or dried safely. N.B. Fighting a large (i.e. bulk storage) alcohol fire using water or aqueous (water) film-forming foam (AFFF) extinguishers may be ineffective and may spread the fire over a larger area rather than put it out."
Where should alcohol-based handrub dispensers be located?,"As described within the risk minimization section, handrub dispensers should not be placed above or close to potential sources of ignition, such as light switches and electrical outlets, or next to oxygen or other medical gas outlets, due to the increased risk of vapours igniting."
What advocacy work is WHO doing for the initiative?,"WHO is developing an advocacy strategy which includes a work plan linking action undertaken at the country, regional and global levels.WHO participates in all relevant global-level fora and coordinates regularly with other agencies who are advocating on this issue to highlighting the problem and action to be taken.Communication products are systematically developed and disseminated through various media such as social media, news agencies and our home page."
What does WHO want to achieve through its advocacy work?,"Through our advocacy work, WHO adds a voice to the global efforts to address the issue of attacks on health care based on our constitution of ensuring the highest level of health for all. As the specialized agency of the United Nations for international public health, it is WHO’s imperative to ensure health care is protected to enable delivery of services. For this reason, our advocacy strategy’s objective is to promote the safe delivery of and safe access to health care for all without being hampered by acts of violence or obstructions."
Does WHO work with partners?,"WHO joins forces with a multitude of partners working to mitigate the impact of attacks on health care. As one of the voices working towards this goal, WHO contributes to the global effort and complex dialogue on the topic attacks. WHO is always willing to expand its network and collaborate as necessary with all relevant initiatives."
Who is WHO working with on this initiative?,"There are many partners active in this field and WHO is one among them. For this reason, WHO maintains constant dialogues with other organizations, groups and initiatives including: The Global Health Cluster, and country Health Cluster partnersThe Office for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human RightsUNICEF’s Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM)ICRC’s Health Care in Danger initiativeMédecins Sans Frontières, health programmesGeneva CallInternational Council of NursingAnd other relevant organization with a shared interest to prevent attacks and better protect health care from attacksWHO also participates in the Friends of Security Council Resolution 2286 working group in Geneva and regularly briefs Member States on the progress of the initiative."
What are attacks on health care?,"WHO defines an attack on health care as any act of verbal or physical violence or obstruction or threat of violence that interferes with the availability, access and delivery of curative and/or preventive health services during emergencies. The nature and types of attacks vary across contexts and can range from violence with heavy weapons to psychological threats and intimidation.Examples of types of attacks on health can include:Violence with individual weaponsViolence with heavy weaponsPsychological violence/threat of violence/intimidationObstruction to delivery of careAssault without weaponsSexual assaultDenial of access to servicesArmed or violent search of health resourceRemoval of health care assets Setting fire to health resourcesMilitarization of health care facility Removal of health care assets"
What is the Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care?,"The Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA) is a global, standardized monitoring system to collect primary data of attacks on health care. WHO works closely with partners on the ground to gather relevant information, which is then reviewed by the WHO country office, and published in near-real time to the publically available website:  ssa.who.int. The SSA is used in emergency-affected countries and fragile settings that are priority areas of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme. As of July 2020, there are 16 reporting countries.:Furthermore, the SSA website aggregates the global data and allows users to filter the data for tailored analysis:  Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA) dashboard."
Is all of the data publicly available?,"The SSA publishes data that is collected and verified by WHO on the affected health resources, types of attacks and number of affected personnel. Information such as the date of an attack, the country in which it occurred and its associated certainty level is also available. Furthermore, the SSA website aggregates the global data and allows users to filter the data for tailored analysis.The SSA has specific measures in place to protect the confidentiality of sources and to prevent any further harm to survivors of an attack and affected population. For this reason, WHO does not share data beyond information published on the SSA."
Does WHO seek to identify the perpetrators of the attacks? Why or why not?,"WHO does not collect nor verify information on perpetrators as WHO does not have the mandate nor the capacity to address the question of perpetrators of attacks. WHO’s objective is not to instigate action in relation to accountability but to increase awareness of the issue by highlighting the extent and consequences of the problem, so as to instigate action to prevent attacks from occurring."
What are autism spectrum disorders?,Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of complex brain development disorders. This umbrella term covers conditions such as autism and Asperger syndrome. These disorders are characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication and a restricted and repetitive repertoire of interests and activities.
How common are autism spectrum disorders?,"Reviews estimate that 1 child in 160 has an autism spectrum disorder. This estimate represents an average figure, and reported prevalence varies substantially across studies. Some recent studies have, however, reported rates that are substantially higher."
Do people with an autism spectrum disorder always suffer from intellectual disability?,"The level of intellectual functioning is extremely variable in persons with an autism spectrum disorder, ranging from profound impairment to superior non-verbal cognitive skills. It is estimated that around 50% of persons with ASD also suffer from an intellectual disability."
How early can an autism spectrum disorder be recognized in children?,Identifying an autism spectrum disorder is difficult before the age of about 12 months but diagnosis is generally possible by the age of 2 years. Characteristic features of the onset include delay in the development or temporary regression in language and social skills and repetitive stereotyped patterns of behaviour.
What can parents do to help their child with an autism spectrum disorder?,"Parents have an essential role in providing support to a child with an autism spectrum disorder. They can help to ensure access to health services and education, and offer nurturing and stimulating environments as their child grows up. Recently, it has been shown that parents can also help deliver psychosocial and behavioural treatments to their own children."
What causes autism spectrum disorders?,"Scientific evidence suggests that various factors, both genetic and environmental, contribute to the onset of autism spectrum disorders by influencing early brain development."
Are childhood vaccines responsible for autism spectrum disorders?,"Available epidemiological data show that there is no evidence of a link between measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism spectrum disorders. Previous studies suggesting a causal link were found to be seriously flawed. There is also no evidence to suggest that any other childhood vaccine may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorders.  In addition, evidence reviews commissioned by WHO concluded that there was no association between the use of vaccine preservatives such as thiomersal and autism spectrum disorders."
The WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD) just held a special session on cannabis. Why is this important?,"It was the first time the WHO ECDD reviewed cannabis and cannabis-related
substances to consider the appropriateness of their current scheduling within the
International Drug Control Conventions.
The Committee, which met from 4-7 June 2018, conducted a pre-review of cannabis related substances that are currently subject to international control:
Cannabis plant (e.g. marijuana) and cannabis resin (e.g. hashish)
Extracts and tinctures of cannabis (oils, edibles, liquids) Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) e.g. dronabinol Isomers of THC
The ECCD also conducted a critical review of preparations considered to be pure
cannabidiol (CBD), a major component of the plant."
What is the difference between a pre-review and a critical review?,"A pre-review is the first step of the ECDD’s assessment process, where it is determined
whether there is enough robust scientific information to proceed to the next step, called
a critical review. This initial evaluation is also an opportunity to identify gaps in the
available scientific data.A critical review is carried out when there is sufficient scientific evidence to allow the
ECDD to make informed an recommendation that the substance be placed under
international control, or if its level of control should be changed.Substances under control are regulated by the International Drug Control Conventions,
which restrict international production and trade of these substances. Individual
countries can exercise discretion in how they will apply controls within their territories.
This is why the use of cannabis for medical purposes is legalised in some countries,
while it is not in others."
What did the ECDD decide?,"The Committee made two main decisions:There was sufficient evidence to proceed to a critical review of cannabis and
related substances at the next ECDD meeting in November 2018.
The ECDD recommended that preparations considered to be pure cannabidiol
(CBD) not be placed under international drug control as the substance was not
found to have psychoactive properties, and presents no potential for abuse or
dependence."
Does this mean that cannabis-related substances should be available for medical use?,"The ECDD is an independent group of experts in the field of drug dependence
convened by WHO. Its role is not to recommend the use of substances for medical
treatment, but rather to advise on the scheduling of substances based on evaluations of
potential for harm, dependence and abuse from a public health perspective, as well as
their therapeutic usefulness.WHO then makes recommendations to the UN Secretary General, and the decision
whether to adopt the recommendations is subject to a vote by the UN Commission on
Narcotic Drugs."
What information did the ECDD consider when making their decisions?,"WHO commissioned reviews of each cannabis-related substance from scientific experts
in five different disciplines: chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, epidemiology, and
therapeutic use. The experts were selected through a rigorous screening process in
accordance with WHO procurement guidelines and on the basis of demonstrated
extensive knowledge of and expertise in the subject. Selection criteria were also
designed to ensure balanced geographic and gender representation. In accordance with
WHO policy, all experts were asked to disclose potential conflicts of interest.
All Member States were invited to submit relevant information to the ECDD through a
specially designed questionnaire to gather insights into the legitimate use, harmful use,
status of national control, and potential impact of international control for each
substance under evaluation.
The ECDD meeting also included an Open Session at which representatives of civil
society, patient groups, academics and commercial parties had the opportunity to share
their views and experiences regarding the uses of cannabis for the Committee’s
consideration."
Why had cannabis never been reviewed until now?,"The ECDD acts in accordance with International Drug Control Conventions that identify
criteria to schedule or propose rescheduling of substances under control. Within these
Conventions, there has until recently been limited robust scientific information about the health effects of cannabis for the ECDD to consider its review. As more Member States
permit the use of cannabis for medical and non-medical purposes, more evidence is
emerging about their health effects. The ECDD determined that there is now enough
information to conduct a full review of cannabis and its related substances."
When is the ECDD expected to make its recommendations on the scheduling of cannabis?,"The next ECDD meeting will be held in November 2018. At that time, the Committee
will undertake critical reviews of cannabis and related substances.
The meeting will also be an opportunity to review several New Psychoactive
Substances (NPS) like synthetic cannabinoids and fentanyl-analogues, as well as
medicines such as tramadol and pregabalin."
What are the health risks associated with mobile phones and their base stations?,"This is a question which WHO takes very seriously. Given the 
immense number of people who use mobile phones, even a small increase in
 the incidence of adverse effects on health could have major public 
health implications. 
		Because exposure to the radiofrequency (RF) fields emitted by 
mobile phones is generally more than a 1000 times higher than from base 
stations, and the greater likelihood of any adverse effect being due to 
handsets, research has almost exclusively been conducted on possible 
effects of mobile phone exposure. Research has concentrated on the following areas: cancerother health effectselectromagnetic interferencetraffic accidents. CancerBased on mixed epidemiological evidence on humans regarding an
 association between exposure to RF radiation from wireless phones and 
head cancers (glioma and acoustic neuroma), RF fields have been 
classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as 
possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). Studies to date provide no 
indication that environmental exposure to RF fields, such as from base 
stations, increases the risk of cancer or any other disease. Other health effectsScientists have reported other health effects of using mobile 
phones including changes in brain activity, reaction times, and sleep 
patterns. These effects are minor and have no apparent health 
significance. More studies are underway to try to confirm these 
findings. Electromagnetic interferenceWhen mobile phones are used very close to some medical devices
 (including pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, and certain hearing 
aids) there is the possibility of causing interference with their 
operation. The risk is much reduced for 3G phones and newer equipment. 
There is also the potential of interference between mobile phones 
signals and aircraft electronics. Some countries have licensed mobile 
phone use on aircraft during flight using systems that control the phone
 output power.Traffic accidentsResearch has shown an increased risk of traffic accidents, 
some 3-4 times greater chance of an accident, when mobile phones (either
 handheld or with a ""hands-free"" kit) are used while driving due to 
distraction. ConclusionsWhile an increased risk of brain tumours from the use of 
mobile phones is not established, the increasing use of mobile phones 
and the lack of data for mobile phone use over time periods longer than 
15 years warrant further research of mobile phone use and brain cancer 
risk. In particular, with the recent popularity of mobile phone use 
among younger people, and therefore a potentially longer lifetime of 
exposure, WHO has promoted further research on this group and is 
currently assessing the health impact of RF fields on all studied 
endpoints."
What is an Emergency Medical Team (EMT)?,"EMTs are groups of health professionals (doctors, nurses, paramedics etc.) that treat patients affected by an emergency or disaster. They come from governments, charities (NGOs), militaries and international organizations such as the International Red Cross/Red Crescent movement. They work to comply with the classification and minimum standards set by WHO and its partners, and come trained and self-sufficient so as not to burden the national system.Emergency medical teams have a long history of respondinig to sudden onset disasters (SOD) such as the Haiti earthquake, the Indian Ocean Tsunami and the floods in Pakistan.EMTs historically have had a trauma and surgical focus, but Ebola has shown us their value in outbreak response and other forms of emergency.The Ebola response was the largest deployment of EMTs for an outbreak (58 teams), which pales in comparison to the 151 teams deployed to respond to Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013 and the nearly 300 teams deployed to Haiti following the earthquake.Requirements for emergency health response are broader than those required for sudden onset disasters and trauma. They must include the ability to care for diseases such as cholera, Shigella and Ebola, as well as teams to support populations affected by flood, conflict and protracted crises such as famine."
How do we define an EMT?,EMTs work under the guidelines of the WHO Classification and Minimum Standards for Foreign Medical Teams in sudden onset disasters guidance. These guidelines discuss the principles and core standards of how registered EMTs must function and declare their operational capabilities. The electronic version of these guidelines can be found from the link below.Classification and minimum standards for Emergency Medical Teams in sudden onset disasters
What is the work of WHO to date in this area?,"Classification and minimum standards were published in mid-2013.These standards were used for the first time successfully in November 2013, following typhoon Haiyan. The Department of Health Philippines coordinated the deployment of 151 EMTs and found the new classification system fit for purpose.A new EMT unit was set up in the department of Emergency Risk Management & Humanitarian Response, WHO, Geneva, in February 2014.Their work has included:Building a new global registration system that will allow EMTs to register their capacity and be classified.Progression of EMT coordination in Southeast Asia, the Americas, Caribbean, Europe and the Pacific.Closer collaboration with UN OCHA, INSARAG (International Search and Rescue Advisory Group), UNDAC (UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination) teams and use by FMTs of the UN OSOCC (onsite operations and coordination centre) mechanisms.Regional exercises in the Americas with Urban Search and Rescue and EMTs co-deployed.Next steps for 2015 include:Working with countries to develop their national medical response team capacityTraining national ministries of health, in countries likely to suffer natural disasters, to be aware of the capacities of FMTs, and establish arrangements for the reception and coordination of teams on arrival.Development of best practice guidance and standards for FMTs to respond to the care of children, pregnant women, patients with disabilities, older people, and those with pre-existing health issues who have lost access to their medication during the disaster etc."
What is the Global EMT Registry?,"WHO has developed a global registration system where emergency medical teams can be verified and classified ready to be deployed to health emergencies. A global registry of all EMTs that meet the WHO EMT minimum standards for deployment in sudden onset emergencies from all-hazards provides time-limited surge clinical capacity to the affected populations. It serves as a deployment and coordination mechanism for all partners who aim to provide clinical care in emergencies such as tsunami, earthquake, flood, and more recently, in large outbreaks, such as the West Africa Ebola outbreak, which require a surge in clinical care capacity. It allows a country affected by a disaster or other emergency to call on teams that have been pre-registered and quality assured."
What are its aims?,"Improve the quality of care providedImprove coordination between clinical care teamsProvide a predictable and timely response to affected governments and populationsServe as a quality improvement forum, with working groups developing minimum standards, best practice guidance, and sharing best practice between partnersProvide a forum for interaction between EMT providers and potential recipient countries, including allow countries to inform EMTs of the specific standard operating procedures (SOPs) and requirements for access to their country in the event of an emergency. (e.g. rules on importation of pain relief, registration as a doctor, etc.)"
What does the Global Registry enable countries to do?,"It enables countries to improve their own national capacity, which they are then able to use to assist other countries in emergencies.It enables affected countries to accept and use EMTs in a timely, coordinated manner.Host governments and affected populations can depend on FMTs from the registry to arrive trained, equipped and capable of providing the intervention promised. Victims and their families can expect the clinical teams treating them to be of a safe minimum standard.Each team has unique individuals with various skill sets. Identifying these differences and placing them into the field requires coordination and communication to ensure the correct gaps are filled. EMT staff help facilitate and coordinate this placement.Offers of EMT assistance are more likely to be accepted if teams have pre-registered and have demonstrated their quality. Pre-registration will expedite arrival and tasking procedures in-country. Registered teams will be working within the national and international response effort rather than apart.Donors will have surety that the EMTs registered will have reached a minimum standard and would be able to offer a preferred list of accredited medical organisations that could be supported financially and through other means.The global community is now able to build around a predictable and described clinical surge capacity and can use this registry to examine capabilities and gaps for local response to various emergencies."
What is the role of EMTs in the Ebola Response?,"Traditionally, EMTs were used for sudden onset disasters like earthquakes and typhoons, with a trauma and surgical focus. Ebola care during this multi-country outbreak has necessitated unique medical knowledge and equipment, and has carried unique risks for health care workers. The progress made against Ebola is part thanks to the response by the national and international teams that run the 72 Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) across three countries.WHO and the world have learned important lessons from the Ebola response that have a wider application to the agency and the global health response community. These lessons have been used to improve coordination, quality and predictability of clinical response teams deploying with surge capacity as EMTs.Over 40 organizations, including international NGOs, military, faith-based organizations and governments have deployed EMTs throughout the current Ebola Response.Countries that have sent EMTs to West Africa include Australia, China, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Ethiopia, France, Germany,Kenya, Korea, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Uganda, United Kingdom and United States of America."
Can Zika virus be transmitted through donated blood?,"Zika virus may present a risk to blood safety. Currently there
 is a limited knowledge of Zika virus and the ways it can be 
transmitted. The majority of cases are transmitted to people through the
 bite of an infected mosquito, Aedes mosquitos. Until more is 
known about other means of transmission, precautions should be taken to 
ensure the supply of blood is safe. Zika virus has been detected in blood donors in affected areas.Transmission of related flaviviruses (dengue and West Nile virus)
 by blood transfusion has been documented, and thus transmission of Zika
 virus is possible. Recently 2 probable cases of Zika virus transmission by blood transfusion have been reported from Campinas, Brazil."
What precautions should be taken to ensure that the blood supply is safe in countries where Zika infection is occurring?,"Ideally the blood supply during a regional outbreak of Zika should
 be maintained by increasing blood collections in non-affected areas. In
 non-affected areas, consideration may be given to defer potential 
donors who have recently visited areas with ongoing transmission of Zika
 virus infection for 28 days after their departure from these areas."
What about blood donations in areas affected by Zika?,"Blood collection may need to continue in affected areas to meet 
needs for blood and its components. This may be necessary when an 
outbreak is affecting a large swathe of a country or when it is not 
possible to get blood from regions where Zika is not circulating."
What measures may be considered for reducing the risk of Zika virus through blood transfusion in areas with active Zika virus transmission?,"Temporary exclusion of donors with a recent clinical history 
consistent with Zika virus disease, such as a combination of fever or 
rash with pinkeye, muscle aches, headache or malaise. Temporary exclusion of donors for whom laboratory test results show they may recently have been infected. Donors with clinical history consistent with Zika virus disease 
or a recent history of Zika virus infection should be deferred for a 
period not less than 28 days following the full resolution of symptoms.Similarly, sex partners of men with confirmed or suspected Zika 
virus infection in the last 3 months should be deferred for at least 28 
days after their last sexual contact.People who have already donated must be encouraged to report to 
the blood transfusion service if they subsequently get symptoms of Zika 
virus infection, or if they are diagnosed with recent Zika virus 
infection within 14 days after blood donation.Blood components of appropriate shelf life (e.g. red blood cells)
 may be quarantined for a period of 7–14 days and released following 
confirmation from the donor that he or she has not experienced symptoms 
consistent with the acute phase of Zika virus infection. For platelets, 
which have a shorter shelf life, a 3-day quarantine period may be 
considered.Countries with many visitors to affected countries may need to 
assess the impact of deferral on blood supply availability and weigh the
 risks against the benefits of restricting donations."
How could blood donations be tested for the presence of Zika virus?,"Where possible, blood donations may be tested for the presence of 
Zika virus by appropriate tests.  Likely, pathogen reduction technology 
(PRT) may be implemented for plasma and platelets.In some cases, the selective testing for the presence of the virus in blood donors returning from affected countries may be considered as an alternative to deferral."
Should countries prepare that only have the Aedes mosquitoes but where the Zika virus has not been found?,"WHO recommends that countries where the mosquito that carries Zika
 exists, yet the virus itself has not been found, consider preparing a 
plan to ensure the availability of a safe and sufficient supply of blood
 should an outbreak occur."
Where does yellow fever occur?,"Yellow fever occurs in 47 endemic countries in Africa in Central and South America. Around 90% of cases reported every year occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.Infected travellers from areas where yellow fever occurs can export cases to countries that are free of yellow fever, but the disease can only spread easily if that country has the mosquito species able to transmit it, specific climatic conditions and the animal reservoir needed to maintain it."
How do you get yellow fever?,"The yellow fever virus is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, most commonly from the Aedes species – the same mosquito that spreads the Zika, Chikungunya and Dengue virus. Haemogogus mosquitoes also spread yellow fever and are mostly found in the jungle. Mosquitoes become infected with the virus when they bite an infected human or monkey. The disease cannot be spread by contact from one person to another.Mosquitoes breed in tropical rainforests, humid, and semi-humid environments, as well as around bodies of still water in and close to human habitations in urban settings. Increased contact between humans and infected mosquitoes, particularly in urban areas where people have not been vaccinated for yellow fever, can create epidemics.Outbreaks of the disease are of particular concern when they occur in overcrowded settings with inadequate water supply and waste management services that allow the mosquitoes to breed easily."
What are the symptoms?,"Once contracted, the yellow fever virus incubates in the body for 3 to 6 days. Symptoms usually present themselves in 2 phases.The first, ""acute"", phase usually causes fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, shivers, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. Most patients improve and their symptoms disappear after 3 to 4 days.However, a small percentage of people enter a second, more toxic phase within 24 hours of the initial remission. They will experience high fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain with vomiting and deteriorating kidney function. Bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach, with blood appearing in vomit and faeces. Half of the patients who enter the toxic phase die within 10 to 14 days, the rest recover without significant organ damage."
How is it treated?,"There is no specific treatment for yellow fever but good supportive treatment of symptoms, such as dehydration, fever and infection, improves survival rates. Associated bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics. Yellow fever can be prevented by an extremely effective vaccine that is protective for life."
How is it diagnosed?,"Yellow fever is difficult to diagnose (especially during the early stages) because its symptoms can be confused with other common diseases such as malaria, dengue, leptospirosis and Zika virus, as well as with poisoning. Doctors or clinicians who see a sick patient may not be able to tell that they have yellow fever from their symptoms alone, especially if they are in an area where many of these diseases are occurring at the same time.To confirm a suspected diagnosis of yellow fever, laboratory tests need to be done. Blood tests can detect antibodies produced in response to yellow fever, proving that the person has been infected or vaccinated. Several other techniques are used to identify the virus in blood specimens or liver tissue collected after death. These tests require highly trained laboratory staff and specialized equipment and materials."
How can it be prevented?,"Vaccine is the most important means to combat yellow fever. The yellow fever vaccine is safe and affordable, and a single dose provides life-long immunity against the disease. To prevent outbreaks in affected regions, vaccination coverage must reach at least 80% of the population at risk.Mosquito control can also help to prevent yellow fever, and is vital in situations where vaccination coverage is low or the vaccine is not immediately available. Mosquito control includes eliminating sites where mosquitoes can breed, and killing adult mosquitoes and larvae by using insecticides in areas with high mosquito density. Community involvement through activities such as cleaning household drains and covering water containers where mosquitoes can breed is a very important and effective way to control mosquitoes."
Is the vaccine effective and safe?,"Vaccination is the single most important measure for preventing yellow fever. The vaccine has been used for many decades and is safe and affordable, providing effective immunity against yellow fever within 10 days for more than 90% of people vaccinated and within 30 days for 99% of people vaccinated. A single dose provides lifelong protection and costs less than US$ 2.Side effects of the yellow fever vaccine are generally mild and may include headaches, muscle aches, and low-grade fevers. There have been rare reports of serious side-effects."
Who should be vaccinated?,"In countries where yellow fever occurs, WHO strongly recommends routine vaccination for everyone older than 9 months. During an epidemic, when a mass vaccination campaign is underway, the vaccine is given to everyone over the age of 6 months (when the risk of disease is higher than an adverse event from the vaccine).WHO recommends vaccination for all travellers (with few exceptions) visiting areas where there is risk of yellow fever. Travellers, who have medical grounds for not being vaccinated, must have those grounds certified by the appropriate authorities.Many countries require proof of vaccination against yellow fever before they will issue a visa, particularly if travellers come from or have visited a country where yellow fever occurs. Make sure to keep your yellow fever proof of vaccination safe and bring it with you when you travel to another country.Map: Yellow fever vaccination requirements"
Who should not be vaccinated?,"Some people should not be routinely vaccinated, including:infants aged less than 9 months (or less than 6 months during an outbreak, where the risk of disease is higher than an adverse event from the vaccine)pregnant women (unless during an outbreak)people with severe allergies to egg protein; andpeople with severe immunodeficiency"
Am I protected from yellow fever immediately following vaccination?,"In general, it takes 10 to 14 days from the date of vaccination for a person to develop immunity to the yellow fever virus. Additional personal protection measures from mosquitoes are critically important during this 10-14 day period in yellow fever endemic areas. These include wearing protective clothing, sleeping under insecticide treated bed nets even during the day and using recommended repellents. The vaccination certificate for yellow fever is valid from 10 days after administration of the vaccine for recipients."
Is eradication of yellow fever possible?,Eradication of yellow fever is not feasible since we are unable to control the virus in the natural animal hosts.
Who manages the vaccine supply for yellow fever outbreaks?,In an emergency situation it is often difficult to get enough vaccine doses to protect the entire population at risk due to the limited global vaccine supply. The emergency stockpile is managed by the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Yellow Fever Control which was created in 2001. The role of the ICG is to verify that eligibility criteria are met by countries applying for outbreak support from the stockpile and to decide on the amount of vaccine to be shipped.International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision
Who manages the yellow fever vaccine supply for routine immunization and preventive mass campaign?,"WHO and UNICEF have the oversight role in tracking and supplying yellow fever vaccine for routine immunization. The YF Initiative (YFI) led by WHO and UNICEF coordinates yellow fever control at the global level. The goals of the Initiative are to prevent yellow fever outbreaks and to secure the supply of yellow fever vaccines. The Yellow Fever Initiative monitors the yellow fever activities at global level and identifies priorities in routine immunization, preventive campaigns, and outbreaks, including yellow fever vaccine supply issues."
What is yaws?,"Yaws is a poverty-related chronic skin disease that affects mainly children below 15 years of age (with a peak between 6 and 10 years).

Yaws forms part of a group of chronic bacterial infections commonly known as the endemic treponematoses. These diseases are caused by spiral bacteria of the genus Treponema, which also includes endemic syphilis (bejel) and pinta. Yaws is the most common of these three infections.

It is caused by the bacterium - is a Treponema pallidumm subspecies pertenue and transmitted by skin contact. Yaws mainly affects the skin, but can also involve the bone and cartilage. The organism that causes yaws is closely related to the one that causes syphilis. Early detection and treatment can avoid gross disfigurement and disability which occur in about 10% of cases."
Where does yaws occur?,"Yaws occurs in overcrowded communities, with limited access to basic amenities, such as water and sanitation, as well as health care.

Yaws primarily affects children aged under 15 years who live in poor communities in warm, humid and tropical forested areas of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific islands."
How is yaws diagnosed?,"Traditionally, laboratory-based serological tests such as Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) are widely used to diagnose treponemal infections (for example, syphilis and yaws). These tests cannot distinguish yaws from syphilis however, and the interpretation of results from these tests in adults who live in yaws endemic areas needs careful clinical assessment because of syphillis.
Rapid point-of-care tests that can be used in the field are widely available.
However, most of them are treponemal-based and cannot distinguish between past and current infection. Recently dual treponemal and nontreponemal rapid tests have become available, thus simplifying diagnosis in the field. These tests are able to detect both present and past infections to guide treatment of people with active infection.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to definitively confirm yaws by detecting the organisms in the skin lesions. It can also be used to monitor azithromycin resistance and this test will be very useful in the last phase of the eradication programme."
How can yaws be treated?,"Yaws is cured with a single oral dose of either of 2 antibiotics – azithromycin or benzathine penicillin.


Azithromycin (single oral dose) at 30 mg/kg (maximum 2 gm) is the preferred choice in the WHO ""Yaws Eradication Strategy"" (the Morges Strategy) because of the ease of administration and logistical consideration in large-scale treatment campaigns.
Benzathine penicillin (single intramuscular dose) at 1.2 million units (adults) and 600 000 units (children). For patients allergic to penicillin and azithromycin, doxycycline 100mg (1 tab) orally, b.d. twice daily for 7 days may be used."
How can yaws be prevented?,There is no vaccine for yaws. Health education and improvement in personal hygiene are essential components to reduce transmission of the disease. Contacts of patients with yaws should receive empiric treatment.
Why does this report include a special focus on the burden of malaria in pregnant women and children?,"Malaria takes a particularly heavy toll on pregnant women and young children.Our analysis shows that, in 2018, an estimated 11 million pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa were infected with malaria. This resulted in nearly 900 000 children born with a low birth weight. Globally, children account for nearly 70% of malaria-related deaths.The report provides important insight – grounded in strong evidence – into what happens to a pregnant woman and her fetus when the mother is infected with malaria. For example, malaria infection during pregnancy can lead to anaemia in the mother, which can result in complications in pregnancy, premature birth and a low-birth-weight child. Children who are born preterm or with a low birth weight are at a very high risk of dying in their first few weeks of life.Even when a healthy child is born, malaria infection in children can lead to severe malaria and, very often in the highest burden countries, severe malaria anaemia, which also puts the child at greater risk of death."
What are the reasons behind the substantial increase in coverage of preventive malaria therapy seen in 2018 compared to 2017?,"WHO recommends at least 3 doses of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) for all pregnant women living in malaria-endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa. In recent years, coverage of the first 2 doses of IPTp has increased steadily, though not at a rapid rate. Notably, this year’s report shows a significant jump of about 10 percentage points in coverage of the third dose of IPTp between 2017 and 2018.The reason is two-fold. The first is that as WHO receives more data from countries, we have been able to analyse the situation more accurately. And the second is that some countries have put significant effort into scaling up this intervention over the last couple of years. Burkina Faso, Tanzania and a few other countries, for example, have reached significant levels of coverage of the third IPTp dose."
What are the remaining barriers to accessing preventive malaria therapy among pregnant women?,"Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) is delivered through antenatal care clinics (ANC). Whenever a pregnant woman seeks ANC services, she is supposed to receive a dose of IPTp after her first trimester, as long as the doses are administered at monthly intervals.The reasons for barriers are two-fold. First, access to ANC coverage is variable: in some countries it’s very high while in others it’s moderate or even low. Often you will see reasonably high coverage of IPTp during the first visit to an ANC clinic, but lower IPT coverage as ANC visits taper off. As such, the biggest barrier to the scale-up of IPTp is insufficient ANC coverage and/or repeat ANC access.The second barrier is linked to health worker practices and health systems issues. Our analysis shows that about 20% of women who are eligible for IPTp do not receive the drug when they visit an ANC clinic for the first time, either because the health worker does not prescribe it or the drug is not available."
The report shows that investment in malaria basic research and product development has been increasing steadily over the past 3 years. Shouldn’t more research correlate to more gains in the fight against malaria?,"A lot of malaria research is done to provide evidence either on the way we implement malaria interventions, or to allow us to better understand the epidemiology of the disease. Some of this operational and epidemiological research can feed into programmes and have immediate impact.However, investment in the discovery and development of new tools usually takes a long time to bear fruit. Fortunately, there are some promising tools in the pipeline. The first vaccine against malaria, RTS,S, is now being evaluated through a pilot implementation programme. New types of insecticide-treated nets to fight malaria-carrying mosquitoes are also being introduced. Continued investment in the research and development of new tools will be critical to reaching our common goal of a world free of malaria."
How does WHO arrive at its estimates for cases in the World malaria report?,"WHO applies 3 methods for calculating estimates of malaria cases. One method uses routine data from countries without any adjustments; in other words, we use the data “as is”, directly from the country. This approach applies to countries that have a very low number of malaria cases, high-quality surveillance systems, and are near elimination.The second method is for countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa, excluding Botswana, Ethiopia, Namibia and Rwanda, that have a good public health surveillance system but where a large proportion of patients seek care in the private sector or do not seek treatment at all. Here, adjustments for testing rates, reporting and treatment seeking rates are applied to the reported data.The third method applies to most countries in the WHO African Region, where surveillance systems have been historically weak. To come up with a reliable estimate, we measure the relationship between parasite prevalence and case incidence within a specific area."
More and more patients suspected of malaria are being seen and tested in public health facilities. Does this also mean they are getting the right treatment and cure?,"It’s a good question but one without an easy answer. We know that many patients seek care in the public sector. We also know what proportion of those patients are tested for malaria.Although the evidence suggests that most of the patients who seek care for malaria end up receiving an effective artemisinin combination therapy, the actual quality of that treatment – for example, whether patients are given the right number of doses or whether they comply with the dosage regime – is difficult to determine from the data we currently have at our disposal. But we do know that the drugs available in nearly all malaria-endemic countries remain highly efficacious.It’s important to note that, for young children in sub-Saharan Africa showing signs of a fever, access to health care remains far too low. According to country surveys conducted in recent years, 36% of febrile children in the region were not taken for care with a trained medical provider."
Some malaria experts believe we can actually eradicate malaria by 2050. Why don’t the targets of the global malaria strategy include a time-bound goal for achieving a malaria-free world?,"The vision of our global strategy is a malaria-free world. The targets are actually very ambitious: reductions of at least 90% in malaria morbidity and mortality, and the elimination of malaria in at least 35 countries between 2015 and 2030 – that’s an average of at least two countries becoming malaria-free each year. So it’s a highly ambitious strategy.The reason why we don’t have a time-bound goal is that with the current tools and current levels of investment, it’s unlikely we will achieve global eradication by 2030. At the present time, we don’t have an evidence base to show that malaria can be eradicated by 2050 with existing tools, even if very high coverage levels of those tools are achieved in all malaria-endemic settings.According to the recently released executive summary of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group on Malaria Eradication, a successful approach to malaria eradication calls for focused effort in four areas. One of the highest priorities is a renewed research and development agenda. Other priorities include access to affordable, people-centred health services; a reliable, rapid and accurate surveillance and response system; and the development of national and subnational strategies tailored to local conditions."
What do we need to do to get back on track to meet the goals of the Global technical strategy for malaria?,"In the World malaria report 2017, the main message was that the fight against malaria was at a crossroads. The key message for 2018 was that it’s time to get back on track in the global response to the disease.To get back on track, WHO and the RBM Partnership to End Malaria launched the “High burden to high impact” (HBHI) approach in 2018. The new approach essentially recognises the need for stepped-up action across all malaria-endemic countries, and particularly in the 11 countries carrying the highest burden of the disease. Together, these 11 countries account for nearly 70% of the global burden of malaria mortality and morbidity.A number of countries have initiated the HBHI response and are rethinking their strategic planning, interventions and investment based on four response elements. These include galvanising political will to reduce the toll of malaria; better use of strategic information to drive impact; better policy guidance, policies and strategies; and improved coordination of the response within the country – between the ministry of health, the national malaria control programmes and local partners.So, quite clearly, enhanced effort, a smarter way of doing business and better use of the tools at our disposal, including the data, are the best ways to get back on track to meet the goals of our global strategy."
Are drug and insecticide resistance on the rise?,"WHO works with all the malaria-endemic countries to monitor the levels of both drug and insecticide resistance. What we know, at the moment, is that while there is emerging resistance to some antimalarial drugs, particularly in the Greater Mekong Subregion, all current first-line drugs used by all malaria-endemic countries remain highly efficacious.On insecticide resistance, we are seeing increasing levels of resistance to pyrethroids across all malaria-endemic countries. Current evidence suggests that nets treated with pyrethroid insecticides should continue to be used by communities to protect themselves against malaria. However, evidence has also shown that in many areas where mosquitoes have developed resistance to pyrethroids, another type of net treated with a pyrethroid and a synergist (known as a pyrethroid-PBO net) provides improved impact against malaria; the scale-up of such nets is warranted in these areas."
What other threats could affect progress in malaria control?,"In terms of other threats, we are closely monitoring an emerging issue whereby malaria parasites have developed the capacity to evade detection by the most commonly-used rapid diagnostic tests. This is a problem with high prevalence in Eritrea, and we are reviewing data from several other countries in Africa. The immediate threat in moderate-to-high transmission African countries is low – diagnostic tests still remain highly sensitive – but we are looking at the situation closely.The single biggest threat in the fight against malaria, of course, remains funding. While the global community has done an excellent job in ensuring that funding is maintained – the recent replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was the single largest replenishment in the Fund’s history, for example – we still see that financing levels for malaria remain relatively flat. Unless we do things better and smarter, we may only be able to sustain the gains already made. In some settings, even maintaining the gains will be a challenge amid massive population growth."
How may this problem be solved?,"Taking the paediatric environmental history (PEH) allows health care providers to incorporate into the clinical records a description of environmental conditions, behaviours and risk factors relevant to a child's health. For example, about the characteristics of the home/school/playground; potential exposure to pesticides; proximity to waste sites, polluting industries or traffic. Eliciting these together with other information improves the capacity to identify, assess and follow up potentially exposed children at risk and respond with effective measures. It builds the evidence base required for effective interventions and facilitate research. Overall, the PEH taking provides an opportunity for closer interaction between the health professional, the parents and the community."
What is the paediatric environmental history?,"A series of basic, concise questions that enables health professionals to identify children’s potential exposure to environmental factors and special vulnerabilities. Some questions are applicable throughout the world but others are more specific and/or tailored to the local situation and population covered. A concise version of the PEH, called the GREEN PAGE, is available together with PEH guidance materials."
"Who takes the PEH, where, when and how?","Paediatricians, family doctors, primary health care workers, nurses, residents, medical and nursing students, midwives or other health care providers dealing with infants, children and adolescents. The PEH may be taken on symptomatic or asymptomatic children seen at a medical facility or during a home visit. It follows a harmonized questionnaire, and may require several sessions and updating."
What are the key areas covered by the PEH,"Potential environmental hazards: physical, biological, chemical (e.g. pesticides, lead, mercury, solvents, UV radiations, …), and their sources.Where, how and when are children exposed? – in the home, streets, fields, …, in urban and rural areas; through contaminated water, air, food, soil; high-risk behaviours.Effects of exposures in utero, postnatal, in toddlers, infants, school age children and adolescents; clinical or sub clinical effects on organs, systems or functions, and on development."
"Following last year’s World malaria report and its message that the global response to malaria has stalled, where are we in fighting this disease one year on?","The World malaria report 2018 reinforces the message that the world is currently not on track to achieve two critical 2020 milestones of the WHO Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016–2030 (GTS): reducing malaria deaths and disease by at least 40% by 2020. We are particularly concerned by the report’s finding that, in 2017, there were an estimated 3.5 million more cases of malaria in the 10 highest burden African countries. Of the countries hardest hit by malaria, only India showed progress in reducing its disease burden.Coverage of key interventions to prevent and treat malaria – such as insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and antimalarial medicines – has only marginally improved since 2015. Access to preventive therapies that protect pregnant women and children from malaria remains too low. And the burden of anaemia, especially among children who have malaria, remains unacceptably high.Read the World malaria report 2018 Read the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030"
Which findings in the World malaria report offer hope in getting the response back on track?,"Despite a levelling off in progress since 2015, the global malaria response is in a much better place than it was at the start of the century. There continue to be promising pockets of progress in countries that carry a high burden of malaria, such as India, where cases dropped by 24% in 2017 compared with 2016; in Rwanda, which recorded 430 000 fewer malaria cases in 2017 than in 2016; and in Ethiopia and Pakistan, where both countries has estimated decreases of more than 240 000 cases over the same period.The report also reveals that, in a subset of countries that are nearing elimination, the pace of progress is quickening. In 2017, for example, 46 countries reported fewer than 10 000 indigenous malaria cases, up from 37 countries in 2010, and for the first time, China and El Salvador reported zero indigenous cases. Earlier this year, WHO certified Paraguay as malaria-free, the first country in the Americas to be granted this status in 45 years."
Why are we not seeing more country-level progress in the malaria fight?,"The World malaria report presents a comprehensive snapshot of global progress and trends in fighting malaria. Identifying why a specific country is not advancing as hoped would require in-depth country-by-country assessments, which is not the purpose of this report. WHO is planning to lead country-focused analyses in the highest burden countries over the next year.At a glance, progress may have slowed for two reasons. First, funding for malaria control in most countries remains insufficient. The overall level of resources available in 2017, although slightly higher than in 2016, continues to fall short of our annual GTS funding target for 2020.Inadequate funding has resulted in major gaps in coverage of core malaria control tools that prevent, diagnose and treat malaria. In 2017, for example, an estimated half of the population at risk of malaria in Africa did not sleep under a treated net. Importantly, most ITNs distributed in recent years were used to replace old nets, resulting in limited quantities to cover additional populations."
Eleven countries – 10 in sub-Saharan Africa and India – together accounted for the bulk of all malaria cases and deaths globally in 2017. What is being done to change the trajectory of the disease in these high burden countries?,"At the World Health Assembly in May 2018, the WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for an aggressive new approach to jump-start progress against malaria. A new country-driven response – “High burden to high impact” – will be launched in Mozambique on 19 November, alongside the release of the World malaria report 2018.The approach will be driven by the 11 countries that carry the highest burden of the disease (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, India, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda and United Republic of Tanzania). Key elements of the new approach include:Political will to reduce the toll of malaria;Strategic information to drive impact;Better guidance, policies and strategies; andA coordinated national malaria response.Catalyzed by WHO and the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, “High burden to high impact” builds on the principle that no one should die from a disease that is preventable and treatable. The support and engagement of all partners will be critically important to the success of this country-led approach.Read High burden to high impact: a targeted malaria response"
"Of the 11 highest burden countries worldwide, India is the only one to have recorded a substantial decline in malaria cases in 2017. What is the reason behind this decline?","India – a country that accounted for 4% of global malaria cases in 2017 – is making significant progress in bringing down its malaria burden. As reflected in this year’s World malaria report, the country registered a 24% reduction in cases over 2016, largely due to substantial declines of the disease in the highly malarious state of Odisha, home to approximately 40% of all malaria cases in the country.Success factors include rejuvenated political commitment, strengthened technical leadership, which focused on prioritizing the right mix of vector control measures, and increased levels of domestic funding to back efforts. A notable aspect of Odisha’s approach is its network of Accredited Social Health Activists, or ASHAs, who serve as front-line workers to deliver essential malaria services across the state, particularly in rural and remote areas (For more on Odisha’s progress in fighting malaria, and the role played by ASHAs, see the photo essay on India takes on malaria in its highest burden state."
The report reveals that malaria is on the rise in the Americas. What are the factors that have contributed to this situation?,"Malaria cases in Venezuela have risen significantly over the past 3 years: 136 000 cases in 2015, 240 000 in 2016, and 411 000 in 2017. The increase is largely linked to the unaffordability of antimalarial drugs, weakened vector control programmes and the movement of malaria-infected persons in the gold-mining areas of Bolivar State into other areas of the country with malariaprone ecosystems.The rise in malaria cases in Nicaragua (2200 in 2015, 6200 in 2016 and 10 900 in 2017) is mainly due to increased malaria transmission in a municipality in the country’s Atlantic region. Here, migration combined with environmental and socio-economic factors have created prime conditions for malaria-carrying mosquitoes.After sustained progress in fighting malaria, Brazil has reported a significant jump in cases in the last two years, from 124 000 in 2016 to 189 000 in 2017. Increases were concentrated in several endemic states of the Amazon region, including in municipalities that had recently achieved significant reductions in transmission. A key challenge has been reaching remote and vulnerable populations with malaria prevention and control tools, such as diagnostic testing and treatment."
"The level of funding for the global malaria response stood at US$ 3.1 billion in 2017, a slight increase over 2016. What is needed to boost funding to reach the targets of the Global Technical Strategy?","Funding for malaria has levelled off in recent years. When analysed on a country-by-country per capita basis, investments have decreased for many high burden countries, averaging US$ 2.32 per person at risk annually. This level of funding translates into fewer resources available to protect increasing populations at risk of malaria. Despite the significant financial and economic crises experienced by many countries in the last few years, it is commendable that funding levels have remained stable. Still, to reach the targets of the GTS, it will be critical to increase international financing and the contributions of endemic countries."
This year’s report includes a section on malaria and anaemia. Why is this topic an important one to highlight in 2018?,"The special focus on anaemia is intended to raise awareness of malaria-related anaemia – a condition that, left untreated, can result in death, especially among vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and children under five.Anaemia was once a key indicator of progress in malaria control and its prevalence was used to evaluate the efficacy of interventions. Recent years have seen a decline in awareness of the burden of malaria-related anaemia, despite its importance as a direct and indirect consequence of malaria. As a result, the prevalence of anaemia among populations vulnerable to the disease has not been reported consistently as a metric of malaria transmission and burden.As highlighted in this year’s report, data from surveys conducted in 16 high burden African countries shows that, among children under 5 years of age, the prevalence of any anaemia was 61%, mild anaemia 25%, moderate anaemia 33% and severe anaemia 3%. Of children who tested positive for malaria, the prevalence of any anaemia was 79%, mild anaemia 21%, moderate anaemia 50% and severe anaemia 8%.By spotlighting malaria-related anaemia in this year’s report, we are signalling the importance of paying attention to anaemia and, at the same time, the need to better focus the malaria response on pregnant women and children under 5."
"Since the publication of last year’s report, WHO certified Paraguay as malaria-free. Are other countries close to certification, and are we still on track to reach the 2020 elimination milestone of the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria?","Globally, more countries are moving towards zero indigenous cases: in 2017, 46 countries reported fewer than 10 000 such cases, up from 37 countries in 2010.The number of countries with less than 100 indigenous cases – a strong indicator that elimination is within reach – increased from 15 in 2010 to 26 in 2017. China and El Salvador reported zero indigenous cases in 2017, a first for both countries. Algeria, Argentina and Uzbekistan have made formal requests to WHO for certification.One of the key GTS milestones for 2020 is elimination of malaria in at least 10 countries that were malaria endemic in 2015. At the current rate of progress, it is likely that this milestone will be reached."
"According to the report, coverage and use of insecticide treated bednets across sub-Saharan Africa are on the rise. Are these levels offering sufficient protection?","Looking at the WHO African Region, where malaria is heavily concentrated, we are seeing more people at risk of malaria being protected by insecticide treated bednets (ITNs). Information gathered from household surveys, ITN manufacturers and distributers, including through national malaria control programmes, point to a rise in both household ownership and use of ITNs.For example, over the 2010–2017 period, the percentage of the population protected by an ITN increased from 33% in 2010 to 56% in 2017; household ownership of at least one ITN rose from 47% to 72%; and households with at least one ITN for every two people doubled from 20% to 40%.However, coverage has only marginally improved since 2015, and we are far from reaching the target of universal coverage. Access of populations at risk of malaria to this core tool must be significantly expanded, particularly in high burden countries."
This year’s report features an expanded analysis of resistance to antimalarial drugs and insecticides. How big a threat is resistance to global efforts to control and eliminate malaria?,"WHO takes resistance to any effective disease-cutting tool very seriously. We are working with all malaria-endemic countries to monitor the efficacy of artemisinin-based antimalarial drugs and insecticides.Despite the presence of multidrug resistance in the Greater Mekong subregion, decreasing morbidity and mortality continue to be observed. Equally important to note is that the increase of malaria cases in the WHO African Region is not related to resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which remain fully effective as first-line treatments in these countries. Overall, the immediate threat of antimalarial drug resistance is low and most ACTs remain efficacious in all malaria-endemic settings outside the Greater Mekong.Insecticide resistance is more widespread. Of the 80 malaria endemic countries that provided data for 2010–2017, resistance to at least one of the 4 insecticide classes in one malaria vector from one collection site was detected in 68 countries, an increase over 2016 due to improved reporting and three new countries reporting on resistance for the first time. In 57 countries, resistance to two or more insecticide classes was reported.However, ITNs continue to be an effective tool for malaria prevention, even in areas where mosquitoes have developed resistance to pyrethroids (the only insecticide class used in ITNs). This was evidenced in a large multi-country evaluation coordinated by WHO between 2011 and 2016, which did not find an association between malaria disease burden and pyrethroid resistance across study locations in 5 countries."
"Coverage of seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) has slightly increased, but we continue to see significant coverage gaps. Why is this so?","Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) is a WHO-recommended preventive treatment course for children living in the Sahel, a subregion of Africa. SMC is administered by community health workers at monthly intervals to all children aged 3 to 59 months throughout the high malaria transmission season.In 2017, an estimated 15.7 million children in 12 countries in the Sahel (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Togo) were protected through SMC programmes. However, 13.6 million children who could have benefited from this intervention were not reached, with overall coverage at 53% across the subregion. Common issues reported by countries include insufficient resource allocation and delayed disbursements of funding, which negatively impact the ability of countries to plan and procure medicines in time for the malaria transmission season.WHO is calling on all countries in the subregion, and their development partners, to provide and sustain universal access to this important intervention for all children at risk of malaria."
How does WHO arrive at its estimates for cases in the World malaria report?,"WHO applies 3 methods for calculating estimates of malaria cases. One method uses routine data from countries without any adjustments; in other words, we use the data “as is”, directly from the country. This approach applies to countries that have a very low number of malaria cases, high-quality surveillance systems, and are near elimination.The second method is for countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa, excluding Botswana, Ethiopia, Namibia and Rwanda, that have a good public health surveillance system but where a large proportion of patients seek care in the private sector or do not seek treatment at all. Here, adjustments for testing rates, reporting and treatment seeking rates are applied to the reported data.The third method applies to most countries in the WHO African Region, where surveillance systems have been historically weak. To come up with a reliable estimate, we measure the relationship between parasite prevalence and case incidence within a specific area."
The 2018 report includes updated malaria case and death estimates for the period 2010 to 2016. Why have these estimates been revised?,"n many countries in the WHO African Region, which carries over 90% of the global malaria burden, improvements in surveillance systems are providing new insights. When better and more comprehensive data becomes available, previously-published WHO estimates are revised to reflect the new data from countries. What has not been updated or revised is the methodology used to arrive at the estimates included in the World malaria report.It is important to state that as national surveillance systems improve, the existing WHO model used to estimate malaria cases – i.e. parasite rate to case incidence – is likely underestimating the actual number of cases in many countries in the WHO African Region. In March 2018, WHO convened an Evidence Review Group that reviewed the Organization’s malaria burden estimation methods and made several recommendations for improvements. These recommendations will be implemented in the next edition of the World malaria report."
"The number of malaria cases is going up, yet the number of deaths is going down. Why?","Between 2010 and 2017, malaria deaths globally declined from 607 000 to 435 000. All regions except the Americas recorded reductions in mortality rates in 2017 when compared with 2010. The largest declines occurred in South-East Asia (-54%), Africa (-40%) and the Eastern Mediterranean (-10%). However, despite these gains, the reduction in mortality rates has slowed since 2015, reflecting the estimated trends in malaria case incidence.We exercise caution regarding malaria mortality estimates as weaknesses in most malaria endemic countries’ civil, vital statistics (registration of deaths) and routine health information systems do not allow for reliable analyses of causes of death. This is further compounded by different estimation methods used by WHO and other organizations, resulting in estimates with substantially different mean values for the same year and wide confidence intervals. For these and other reasons, WHO has established an Evidence Review Group on malaria mortality to review existing data and methods to provide the Organization with advice on the best mortality estimation approaches to use in the future."

What are some key tips for developing a GCF project proposal for health?,"Ensure the NDA is engaged and supportive from the beginningShare the draft concept note early with the GCF and WHODevelop a clear theory of change for your projectGCF Project Preparation Facility (PPF) could provide financial support to Accredited Entities to develop a Funding Proposal from project Concept Note;Technical assistance is available to assist Direct Access Entities and NDAs for strengthening Concept Notes and PPF applications.  The technical assistance is not deployed however, to write the PPF proposal or the CN.  The technical assistance is there to provide guidance to help the NDA team or the DAE to write their own concept or PPF proposal."
Why have some of the key metrics in this year’s report changed from the previous year?,"Last year’s report provided projections for 2015 based on trends up to 2013 and 2014; this year’s report includes the latest data we received from the national malaria programmes and nationally representative household surveys from 2015.Overall, there is a reasonably good match between last year’s projections and this year’s estimates. South-East Asia is the one region where the number of reported cases came in much lower than predictions, which required us to update other
    global statistics in the report."
The report shows that total funding for malaria has flat-lined since 2010. How likely are we to meet the funding levels needed to achieve the 2020 targets of the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria (GTS)?,"The goals set by the GTS are ambitious, and robust funding is necessary to achieve them. Because economic growth has slowed in many of our big donor countries, we will need to diversify our funding sources in order to achieve GTS targets. The development
    of new domestic financing mechanisms would help provide a much-needed increase in contributions from malaria-endemic countries. In addition, we must use the funds we do have more strategically. We must select the most appropriate interventions for individual settings, and we need to target populations that will benefit the most."
"We’ve spent a lot of money fighting malaria, but progress towards some GTS targets is off-track. Please explain.","First, it is important to understand that progress is not always linear; it is normal to see some fluctuations in trends as countries make progress towards elimination. Seeing some increases in malaria case incidence in a given year is part of the overall
    pattern of decline. It is when we see countries having multiple years in a row with increases that we start to be concerned.Progress also varies by country. A good number of malaria-endemic countries are on track to achieve the GTS 2020 milestones. However, many also are not. Progress is slowest in low-income countries with a high malaria burden, weak health systems and poor
    access to interventions. Increased funding and strengthened programmatic efforts are urgently needed to accelerate progress in these countries."
"The report shows that the fewer malaria cases a country has, the higher the per capita spending on control and elimination programmes. Shouldn’t it be the other way around?","In low burden settings, programmatic efforts rely less on the delivery of commodities (which tend to be very cost-effective) and instead focus on activities that require more human resources and more of people’s time. This is particularly true for
    malaria surveillance and case investigation, which requires teams of malaria personnel to investigate individual cases. However, while elimination is expensive in the short-term, the longer-term financial and human benefits of achieving elimination
    in a country outweigh the costs."
"The majority of malaria cases and deaths are concentrated in a number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where progress has been slow. What new approaches will be taken to help these countries accelerate progress?","The countries with the highest malaria burden are the countries where progress is most challenging. These countries tend to be very poor and have weak, inaccessible health systems – and, as a consequence, the lowest coverage rates for interventions. We have cost effective tools to prevent and treat malaria; a greater effort is needed to ensure that these tools are made available to those who currently do not have access to them."
Is malaria elimination a realistic goal for high-burden countries?,"Elimination is ultimately the long-term goal for all malaria-endemic countries. But without large increases in funding, innovative new tools, and major improvements in national health systems, it is unlikely that the 13 countries with the highest number
    of malaria cases – Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, India, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda and United Republic of Tanzania – will achieve elimination during the timeframe
    established by the GTS. However, we can still make a lot of progress in these countries with the tools we have now. Many people will benefit from these efforts, even if elimination is not reached in the near-term."
"Why are we seeing a decline in 2015 in the procurement of ACT treatments, a decrease in coverage with IRS, and an expected decline in ITN procurement next year?","Decreases in artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) procurements are twofold. First, there are fewer cases of malaria than in previous years, so fewer treatments are needed. Second, increased testing for malaria means that only patients with a positive
test result are receiving treatment.
Decreases in coverage with indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticides are occurring as countries change or rotate the insecticides they are using to try to prevent the spread of mosquitoes resistant to pyrethroids – a class of chemicals also
used in insecticide-treated bednets. As alternative insecticides are more expensive than pyrethroids, increased funding for IRS is needed to maintain high coverage levels.
Insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) can last for three years and are distributed in three year cycles, so we expect to see some fluctuation in numbers year-by-year. The number of ITNs procured this year was slightly lower than in the two preceding years,
which were the highest on record. However, if we don’t see a subsequent increase in ITN coverage in 2017, then there will be cause for concern."
What are the reasons behind the five-fold increase in the number of women receiving three doses of IPTp?,"It is the result of countries responding effectively to new policy guidance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) issued by WHO. WHO updated the recommended dosing – from two to three doses – based on recommendations from
    an evidence review group in 2012."
1. What is the GCF Readiness Programme?,"The Readiness Programme is a funding mechanism of the GCF that is aimed at enhancing country ownership and access to the GCF.  Readiness activities emphasize strengthening institutional capacities of National Designated Authorities (NDAs) or focal points and Direct Access Entities to efficiently engage with GCF. It also assists countries in undertaking adaptation planning and developing strategic frameworks to build their programming with GCF.There are five objectives for the Readiness Programme and activities proposed under this programme must contribute to one or more of these objectives:Objective 1: Capacity building for climate finance coordinationObjective 2: Strategic frameworks for low-emission investmentObjective 3: Strengthened adaptation planningObjective 4: Paradigm-shifting pipeline developmentObjective 5: Knowledge sharing and learningIt is recommended to become familiar with the GCF Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme Guidebook and related templates, particularly the readiness proposal template."
2. Who can access the GCF Readiness Programme?,"All developing country parties to the UNFCCC can access the Readiness Programme, and GCF aims at least 50 per cent of the readiness support goes to particularly vulnerable countries, including Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and African States."
3. How much funding is available under the GCF Readiness Programme?,"The GCF Readiness Programme provides:Up to USD 1 million per country per year for support related to institutional capacity building, coordination, policy and planning, and programming for investment. Of this overall amount, NDAs may request up to USD 300,000 per year in direct support to help establish or strengthen a NDA or focal point to deliver on the Fund’s requirements. A maximum of USD 100,000 can be used for NDA-led stakeholder meetings.Activities under Objectives 1, 2, 4 and 5 can be proposed for this funding bucket.Up to USD 3 million per country for the formulation of National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and/or other adaptation planning processes. This may include support for subnational adaptation plans and/or sectoral adaptation planning processes including H-NAPs.Activities under Objective 3 can be proposed for this funding bucket."
4. Is it possible to apply for both the USD 1 million per year and the readiness funds of USD 3 million per year at the same time with different readiness delivery partners?,"Yes, it is.  The USD 3 million is a one-time funding allocation available for NAP-related activities (including the development of a health component of a NAP (H-NAP)).  NDAs may have multiple readiness grants under implementation simultaneously with different delivery partners."
5. Are readiness projects intended to be regional or country-specific?,Readiness proposals can be developed and submitted at country level or a regional level depending on the context-specific needs of the country/ies.  NDAs may have multiple readiness grants under implementation simultaneously and countries can participate in both regional and country level readiness projects (without exceeding the funding caps).
6. Is there a division in terms of funding for readiness for mitigation or adaptation?,"There are no funding targets for mitigation/adaptation for readiness.  Readiness emphasizes the development of country capacity.  However, support under Objective 3 – Strengthened adaptation planning can only be sought from the USD 3 million one-time funding allocation."
7. Can readiness funding be used to develop a full project proposal?,"No, readiness funding cannot be used for development of a project proposal.  However, under the readiness programme activities can be conducted that contribute to project development such as concept notes, pre-feasibility studies, sectoral baseline assessments, mitigation potential assessments, vulnerability and impact assessments and sectoral investment action plans.  Readiness activities can also include the development of prioritization methodologies, establishment of measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) frameworks and implantation of climate finance budget protocols."
8. Another sector in my country is already developing/has already submitted a proposal for readiness funds.  Can the health sector still access readiness funds?,Nationally Designated Authorities (NDAs) may have multiple readiness grants under implementation simultaneously up to the maximum amounts specified above.
9. My country is already preparing a project proposal so are we still able to access readiness funds?,"Yes, you may access readiness while preparing a funding proposal, however, the readiness funds cannot be used to develop a full project proposal. If your country has not yet accessed the full USD 1 million cap/year of available readiness funds, the fact that you are pursuing the development of a full project proposal doesn’t mean that you cannot access readiness funds. Since the development and potential approval of a full proposal is a long process, accessing readiness funds may be a good way to increase health representation within the GCF portfolio."
Why is the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities important?,"People with disability are often denied chances to work, go to school and participate fully in society - which creates barriers for their prosperity and well being. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is important because it is a tool for ensuring that people with disability have access to the same rights and opportunities as everybody else. There are around 1 billion people with disability in the world. They are often the poorest of the poor. The stigma and discrimination they suffer are common in all societies.
The Convention is a human rights treaty designed by representatives of the international community - including people with disability, government officials, representatives of nongovernmental organizations and others - to change the way people with disability are viewed and treated in their societies.
Rather than considering disability as an issue of medicine, charity or dependency, the Convention challenges people worldwide to understand disability as a human rights issue. The Convention covers many areas where obstacles can arise, such as physical access to buildings, roads and transportation, and access to information through written and electronic communications. The Convention also aims to reduce stigma and discrimination, which are often reasons why people with disability are excluded from education, employment and health and other services.
For the first time, a legally binding international instrument now exists to guarantee that States that have ratified the treaty will promote and protect the rights of people with disability. These States will next work on passing their own national civil rights legislation to improve the lives of people with disability."
About 20−40% of global health spending is wasted. How can countries be more efficient?,"The world health report 2010 – Health systems financing: the path to universal coverage focuses on 10 opportunities to improve efficiencies. One area is hospitals. Another is medicines. In all cases, the
 report stresses  governments be tough on accountability  and on getting
 the best deal. This means taking steps like those seen recently in 
Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania to improve quality standards 
for malaria drugs. Getting the best deal means negotiating prices. In some 
countries, medicines cost up to 67 times the international average 
price. France saved the equivalent of almost US$ 2 billion in 2008 by 
adopting a strategy of using generic drugs rather than brand name ones 
wherever possible.There are often several ways to prevent or treat a medical 
condition - and costs vary widely. In many cases, it is possible to move
 to less costly more effective interventions."
What are the components of a model health financing system?,"A country is on the right track if the government is:demonstrating the political will to develop the health financing 
system, to move closer to, or maintain universal coverage and is 
engaging all stakeholders including the population in the process;
	allocating sufficient funds to health - this varies depending on 
the context. The average in Africa is just over 10%.  The average 
proportion of total government spending devoted to health in Europe is 
almost 13%;researching new sources of revenue, such as different forms of 
indirect taxation like sales taxes, so called ""sin"" taxes on tobacco and
 alcohol, and taxes on currency transactions;
setting up (or has set up) a system so that people pay for health
 care before they fall sick and draw on the funds when they are sick 
(through health insurance and/or taxation);focusing on getting the best value out of every dollar it spends on health;ensuring that vulnerable groups do not miss out on needed services."
What should donors do?,"Donors need to keep their international promises. Donor 
assistance has increased substantially since 2000. But it is still a 
long way off the target that many developed countries set themselves of 
0.7% of GDP. Official development assistance from governments can be 
supplemented by a variety of innovative financing mechanisms - like the 
airline tax pioneered by France and the Global Fund's ProductRED 
campaign.  When funds are channeled to countries, this should be done in 
ways that explicitly help recipient countries establish their own 
financing mechanisms and institutions. This means a greater focus on 
supporting countries' own plans and it means not establishing manifold 
channels for holding, using and reporting funds in countries that 
compete with the mechanisms that already exist."
What is new in health financing in the report?,"For the first time, The world health report 2010 
suggests that all countries can further develop their health financing 
systems.  If every country implemented just one of the report's 
recommendations, millions of lives would be saved. The report also shows for the first time the amount of money 
that low and middle income countries could raise themselves through a 
variety of options.  For example, simply giving more priority to health 
in government budget allocations could double government health spending
 in low income countries. The report also quantifies the losses that result from just 10
 common causes of inefficiency, offering enormous potential for 
obtaining more health for the money."
What’s the good news in this year’s World malaria report 2017?,"There are several bright spots in this year’s report. First, more countries are accelerating towards elimination. In 2016, 44 countries reported less than 10 000 malaria cases, compared to just 37 countries in 2010. For the second consecutive year, the WHO European Region continued to be malaria-free.We are seeing that coverage rates of access to tools to prevent malaria, such as insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs), have increased across most WHO regions in 2016 when compared to 2010. Another positive development is that testing of suspected malaria cases in the public health sector has gone up significantly in most regions since 2010. The largest rise was recorded in the African Region, where diagnostic testing increased from 36% in 2010 to 87% in 2016. However, across all malaria control interventions, we remain significantly below the targets for universal access.Another piece of good news is that all regions recorded declines in malaria mortality in 2016 when compared to 2010, with the exception of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region where mortality rates have remained largely unchanged.Read the World Malaria Report 2017"
What findings concern you in the report?,"When we look closer at the data, the declining trend in malaria cases and deaths has stalled and even reversed in some regions, at least over the past three years. Equally concerning are continued gaps in coverage of basic prevention, diagnostic and treatment tools. As noted in the report, less than half of households in countries in sub-Saharan Africa have sufficient bednets, and only about one third of children in the African Region with a fever are taken to a medical provider in the public health sector."
"After years of progress, why are we seeing a slowdown in the global fight against malaria?","Globally, we can safely say that after an unprecedented period of success, we are no longer making progress, which is supported by the data in this year’s report.Identifying what is behind this trend is difficult to pinpoint; in any given country, there may be a multitude of reasons as to why the burden of malaria is increasing. Factors impacting progress could range from insufficient funding and gaps in malaria prevention interventions to climate-related variations. Without more data, it is challenging to identify, with any degree of certainty, a specific cause for the trends we are seeing. What is paramount now is taking this year’s malaria report as a wake-up call to stimulate action."
The cover of the World malaria report depicts a crossroads sign. What is the message you are communicating?,"The notion of a crossroads is meant to sum up the current status of the global response to malaria: with current levels of funding, and coverage of current tools, we have reached the limits of what can be achieved in the fight against this disease. The fact that funding for malaria has plateaued, that the number of malaria cases in 2016 is similar to the number of cases in 2012, and that there remain huge gaps in coverage of key malaria control tools, all make clear that unless we increase our efforts, we are not going to see any further progress."
Why is there a sharp decline in the use of indoor residual spraying?,"The proportion of the population at risk protected by indoor residual spraying (IRS), an intervention that involves spraying the inside walls of dwellings with insecticides, declined globally from a peak of 5.8% in 2010 to 2.9% in 2016, with decreases seen in all WHO regions. The number of people protected in 2010 was 180 million globally, reducing to about 100 million in 2016.While there is yet no clear evidence of why this is happening, the decreases in coverage with IRS insecticides are occurring as countries change or rotate the chemicals they are using to try to prevent the spread of mosquitoes resistant to pyrethroids. Because alternative insecticides are more expensive than pyrethroids, increased funding for IRS is needed to maintain high coverage levels of this key intervention to rapidly reduce malaria transmission."
How big a threat is resistance to antimalarial medicines and resistance to insecticides to global efforts to control and eliminate malaria?,"WHO takes resistance to any effective disease-cutting tools very seriously. We are working with all malaria-endemic countries to monitor the efficacy of artemisinin-based antimalarial drugs.This year’s report provides a comprehensive situation analysis to capture, by WHO region, the status of antimalarial drug efficacy. Overall, the immediate threat of antimalarial drug resistance is low and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) remains efficacious in all malaria-endemic settings. Insecticide resistance is more widespread, particularly pyrethroids, which are used in bednets and for indoor residual spraying.A large multicountry evaluation coordinated by WHO between 2011 and 2016 showed that insecticides continue to be an effective tool for malaria prevention, even in areas where mosquitoes have developed resistance to pyrethroids. Further, there is no clear correlation between insecticide resistance and trends in malaria burden: some countries with resistance to pyrethroids have shown reductions in disease burden; others with less resistance have shown an increase. Ultimately, we need more data on the public health impact of insecticide resistance and further investments in this area."
Is the level of funding for the global malaria response on track to reach the 2020 targets of the global malaria strategy?,"No, the level of resources for malaria today is not sufficient to achieve the GTS targets. In 2016, an estimated US$ 2.7 billion was invested in malaria control and elimination efforts globally. This amount falls far short of our annual GTS funding target for 2020 (US$ 6.5 billion).Overall, funding for malaria has levelled off since 2010 and, when analysed on a country-by-country per capita basis, funding has decreased for many high-burden countries, averaging below US$ 2 per person at risk annually. This level translates into fewer resources available to protect increasing populations at risk of malaria.Despite the significant financial and economic crises experienced by many countries in the last few years, it is commendable that funding levels have remained stable. Still, to reach the 2020 targets of the GTS, increasing international financing and the contributions of endemic countries will be critical."
What about malaria elimination – are countries progressing?,"Yes, there is progress towards elimination, but the picture is mixed. Of the 91 countries with malaria transmission, 37 reported fewer than 10 000 cases in 2010 and, by 2016, that number rose to 44 countries. Kyrgyzstan and Sri Lanka were certified by WHO as malaria free in 2016, and Algeria, which remained malaria free in 2016, is now eligible for certification. Further, Argentina and Paraguay have begun the certification process.One of the 2020 milestones of the WHO Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016- 2030 (GTS) is eliminating malaria in at least 10 countries that had malaria transmission in 2015. This means that a country must achieve at least one year of zero indigenous cases by 2020.Early last year, WHO identified 21 countries with the potential to reach the 2020 elimination target. Our latest World malaria report shows that 11 of these countries have recorded increases in indigenous malaria cases since 2015, and 5 countries reported an increase of more than 100 cases in 2016 compared with 2015. Nonetheless, I am optimistic that at least 10 countries will meet the target.Read the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria"
How does WHO arrive at its estimates for cases in the World malaria report?,"WHO applies 3 methods for calculating estimates of malaria cases. One method uses routine data from countries without any adjustments; in other words, we use the data ""as is"", directly from the country. This approach applies to countries that have very low malaria cases, high-quality surveillance systems, and are near elimination.The second method is for countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa, excluding Botswana, Ethiopia, Namibia and Rwanda, that have a good public health surveillance system but where a large proportion of patients seek care in the private sector or do not seek treatment at all. Here, adjustments for confirmation, reporting and treatment seeking rates are applied to the reported data.The third method applies to most countries in the WHO African Region where surveillance systems have been historically weak. As a result, to come up with a reliable estimate, we measure the relationship between parasite prevalence and case incidence within a specific area."
The World malaria report 2017 indicates that this year’s estimates are conservative. What does this mean?,"In many countries in the African Region, improvements in surveillance systems are providing new insights. Data from these countries show that the existing WHO model used to estimate malaria cases – i.e. parasite rate to incidence – is likely underestimating the actual number of cases in many countries in the region. In 2018, WHO will do a comprehensive review of our malaria burden estimation methods for the African Region."
This year’s report looks at the impact of emergencies and political instability on malaria progress. Why include this?,"As part of the report’s section on threats to global malaria progress, we highlight concrete examples of the impact of conflict, humanitarian crises and political volatility on malaria control and elimination efforts. The 4 case studies on malaria epidemics in Nigeria, South Sudan, Yemen and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela demonstrate the fragility of progress and how gains can be reversed, even due to a short period of conflict or economic shocks. For example, Venezuela’s northern region was certified as malaria free in 1961, but last year it was the leading country in the Americas in terms of malaria burden. And in Yemen, due to the ongoing humanitarian situation, there is a reversal of progress under way with an increase in malaria cases seen in 2016."
Last question – what are you most concerned about in the global fight against malaria?,"Malaria represents one of the biggest success stories in recent times in terms of best value for money in public health. Millions of cases and deaths have been averted since 2000 through the scale-up of effective interventions.Having said that, I am concerned that we have become complacent and expect progress to continue at the same levels of funding. Since 2013, the rate of progress has either slowed or stalled in many malaria-endemic countries. We have an opportunity
                to double down our efforts, and it is not just about increasing financing. It also means better and smarter ways to invest available resources. Closing gaps in coverage of the tools that we know work is absolutely critical, as is continued
                investment in the research and development of new tools."
Why is smoking an issue for non-smokers?,"There are some 4000 known chemicals in tobacco smoke; at least 
250 of them are known to be harmful and more than 50 are known to cause 
cancer in humans. Tobacco smoke in enclosed spaces is breathed in by 
everyone, exposing smokers and nonsmokers alike to its harmful effects.
		Around 700 million children, or almost half of the world's 
total, breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke. Over 40% of children have 
at least one smoking parent. In 2004, children accounted for 31% of the 
600 000 premature deaths attributable to second-hand smoke.In adults, second-hand smoke causes serious cardiovascular and
 respiratory diseases, including coronary heart disease and lung cancer.
 In infants, it causes sudden death syndrome. In pregnant women, it 
causes low birth weight. 

Neither ventilation nor filtration, even in combination, can 
reduce tobacco smoke exposure indoors to levels that are considered 
acceptable. Only 100% smoke-free environments provide effective 
protection. Contrary to common belief, smoke-free environments are 
widely supported by both smokers and nonsmokers. Having a smoke-free environment often saves money for bars and
 restaurant owners, reducing their risks of fire and consequently their 
insurance costs. It often results in lower renovation, cleaning and 
maintenance costs, too. 

Article 8 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, 
recognizes that exposure to tobacco smoke causes death, disease and 
disability, and asks countries to adopt and implement legislation that 
provides protection from second-hand smoke. 

Many countries around the world have already introduced laws 
to protect people from exposure to tobacco smoke in public places. 
Celebrations around the globe on World No Tobacco Day (31 May) encourage
 more people and more countries to go smoke-free.Join the trend by claiming your right to public places that are 100% smoke-free inside.Related linksTobacco Free Initiative (TFI)"
Why are malaria mortality rates different in recent studies?,"An article in The Lancet on 3 February 2012 estimated that 
1.24 million people died of malaria in 2010 while for the same year, WHO
 estimated 655 000 people died.  WHO is grateful for efforts of all partners to improve estimates on malaria and other diseases in public health.
It is well appreciated in the public health community that 
estimates are very much influenced by the study sites, data, assumptions
 and methodology used in their studies. In this study, the variation in 
estimates of deaths over the age of 5 is because different methodologies
 were used. WHO stands by their previous estimates that were based on the 
methodology developed by the UN agency in collaboration with other 
partners. WHO welcomes the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s
  estimates that actually show more similarities than differences.  Both
 approaches show that an unacceptably high number of people still die 
from malaria. The trends in disease are steadily downward by both 
methods, thanks to investments in scaling up life-saving tools. To improve disease estimates in the future, it is imperative 
that resource-constrained countries be supported to develop robust 
health information systems. This includes accurate diagnosis of causes 
of deaths; and that all experts working on disease estimates work 
together more collaboratively to produce accurate and timely data.  This
 information is critical for the decision-making that ensures public 
health interventions reach the right communities and have the greatest 
potential of helping more people live longer, healthier lives."
What is the role of WHO in emergencies?,"WHO is committed to saving lives and reducing suffering during times of crisis – whether caused by conflict, disease outbreak or a disaster. WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme is committed to working with Member States and other stakeholders so that suffering and death in crises are minimized and systems are protected and repaired. WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme provides the following services to countries:support of the assessment of country health emergency preparedness and development      of national plans to address critical capacity gaps;development of strategies and capacities to prevent and control high-threat infectious      hazards; andmonitoring of new and ongoing public health events to assess, communicate and      recommend action for public health risks.In addition, WHO will work with countries and partners to:ensure readiness to diminish public health risks in countries with high      vulnerability; andprovide life-saving health services to affected populations in countries with      ongoing emergencies."
How can disaster risk reduction help save lives?,"Emergencies can happen in any country, at any time. When disaster strikes, it can seriously disrupt the functioning of a community and people will depend on help from the outside. But a lot can be done to prevent and reduce the effects of disasters as well as to strengthen the response of communities at risk.Countries with well-developed health systems and a well-trained, well-equipped health workforce in communities are much better prepared for disasters. When a community is well-prepared, many lives can be saved in the first hours after an emergency before external help arrives. The people in the community know local risks and their own needs best.To reduce future risks and human and material losses, WHO helps countries build resilience in health systems by strengthening emergency risk management, an approach which includes measures ranging from prevention to preparedness to response and recovery. Emergency risk management actions include:creating supportive national policies, strategies and allocating resources to manage risks;improving access to quality primary health care before disaster strikes, as well as in response and recovery;training and equipping the health workforce and including them in the planning for all types of emergencies;identifying hazards, vulnerabilities, and capacities to assess risks;promoting risk awareness of emergencies and providing health education (e.g. sanitation and hygiene);providing early warning of emergencies to health providers and communities; andprotecting health facilities from hazards and preparing for emergency health response."
How does WHO work with partners in emergencies?,"The Health Emergencies Programme works with its partners to protect and save people’s lives in all health emergencies. During a crisis, WHO works with the local Ministry of Health and partners to identify where health needs are greatest and to coordinate the efforts of partner organizations to ensure that these areas are covered by both medical supplies and personnel.No organization can act alone in emergencies. WHO regularly collaborates with partner networks to leverage and coordinate the expertise of hundreds of partner agencies:Global Health ClusterEmergency Medical TeamsGlobal Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN)Standby partners"
What is the Health Cluster?,"When emergencies occur, coordination is necessary. No one organization can respond to a health crisis alone. The Global Health Cluster is a platform for more than 900 organizations to work in partnership to ensure collective action results in a more timely, effective and predictable response to health emergencies. WHO is the IASC designated Cluster Lead Agency.The Global Health Cluster exists to support countries by:providing the right expertise at the right place at the right time;building the capacity of Health Cluster Coordinators;gathering and disseminating sound and relevant information to guide partners’ response;identifying and addressing gaps in technical knowledge and available guidance to ensure the health response follows global best practices and standards; and,promoting and advocating for the importance of humanitarian health action on the global stage, to help ensure that political and financial support is secured."
Where does WHO get its funding for emergencies?,"Financing the work of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme includes core financing for baseline staff and activities at the 3 levels of the Programme, financing from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies, and financing for ongoing activities in acute and protracted emergencies through appeals guided by humanitarian response plans.The core budget is the funding WHO uses to implement the normative, technical, and operations-management capacities and activities reflected in the results framework for the Health Emergencies Programme. Funding for the core budget comes from 3 sources:Assessed contributions: The annual quotas paid by Member States to      support the work of the Organization.Core voluntary contributions: Flexible contributions made by Member      States and other donors that the Director-General may allocate at her      discretion and according to need.Earmarked contributions: Voluntary contributions earmarked for the core budget of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme or specific activities within it."
How is WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme monitored?,"On 29 March 2016, the Director-General established the Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee to provide oversight and monitoring of the development and performance of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, guide the Programme’s activities, and report findings through the Executive Board to the Health Assembly. Reports of the Committee will be shared with the United Nations Secretary-General and the Inter-Agency Standing Committee.These are the main functions of the Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee:Assess the performance of the Programme’s key functions in health emergencies      (including all 5 pillars of the work of the Programme, for example,      including both emergency operations and core services).Determine the appropriateness and adequacy of the Programme’s financing and      resourcing.Provide advice to the Director-General.Review the Programme’s reports on WHO’s actions in health emergencies.Review reports on the state of health security developed by the Director-General      for submission to the World Health Assembly through the Executive Board      and to the United Nations General Assembly.Prepare an annual report on its activities, conclusions, recommendations, and,      where necessary, interim reports, for submission by the Chair of the      Committee to the World Health Assembly through the WHO Executive Board.The Committee consists of 8 members drawn from national governments, nongovernmental organizations, and the UN system, with extensive experience in a broad range of disciplines, including public health, infectious disease, humanitarian crises, public administration, emergency management, community engagement, partnerships and development. Members serve in their personal capacity and will exercise their responsibilities with full regard for the paramount importance of independence.The Committee will regularly meet and engage with the Programme management team to help guide its work. They will also assess and influence the work of the Programme through engagement with member states."
What is cOAlition S?,"cOAlition S is an initiative of the European Commission and the European Research Council to make full and immediate open access to research publications a reality. Its members include research councils and funding bodies from across Europe and several non-State actors representing philanthropic foundations, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust. It has also attracted support from outside Europe, most notably from national research bodies in China and India. [Funders that have endorsed Plan S and are jointly working on its implementation. Brussels: Science Europe; 2019 (https://www.coalition-s.org/funders/, accessed 28 August 2019).]cOAlition S is an informal network. Membership requires a public statement in support of the 10 principles of Plan S and how they will be implemented. It should be noted that much of its structure and governance has yet to be defined. Governance and organisational structure. [Brussels: Science Europe; 2019 (https://www.coalition-s.org/governance/, accessed 28 August 2019).]"
What is Plan S?,"Plan S is an initiative that seeks to ensure that “all scholarly publications on the results from research funded by public or private grants provided by national, regional and international research councils and funding bodies,” are published in open-access journals, on open-access platforms, or made immediately available through open-access repositories without embargo. This means that the public can freely access and reuse the research immediately without cost barriers and under the terms of an open licence. Plan S includes a set of 10 principles and guidance on how those principles can be implemented. [Principles and implementation. Brussels: Science Europe; 2019 (https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/, accessed 28 August 2019).]Plan S: making full and immediate open access a reality. [Brussels: Science Europe; 2019 (https://www.coalition-s.org, accessed 28 August 2019).]"
When will Plan S come into effect?,"Plan S will come into effect from 1 January 2021. This will follow an extensive period of consultation with the public and major stakeholders in order to establish the framework for the implementation of the Plan. WHO will engage with other members of cOAlition S during its implementation and will provide updates on how the WHO open-access policy will evolve.[WHO policy on open access. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2017 (https://www.who.int/publishing/openaccess/en/, accessed 28 August 2019).]"
Why has WHO joined cOAlition S?,"The principles of Plan S are strongly aligned with the objectives of WHO’s institutional policies (such as the WHO open-access policy) and its strategies (such as the WHO strategy on research for health), as well as its strategic objectives,
        including achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and supporting universal health coverage. Ensuring universal access to scientific research publications that are publicly funded is fundamental for enabling better public health. Many institutions
        in the world are unable to access a large proportion of scientific information because they cannot afford the subscriptions that the journal publishers charge.[

cOAlition S is supported by several of WHO’s key stakeholders, including Member States, and donors such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the European Commission and the Wellcome Trust. By joining cOAlition S, WHO will align itself
        with the open-access principles and objectives of these stakeholders. As the first UN agency or intergovernmental organization to join this initiative, WHO intends to show strong leadership and provide a bold statement to the international public health community."
What are the requirements of Plan S?,"Researchers must publish in (1) open-access journals or platforms; or (2) in subscription journals (i) that allow authors to deposit the version of record or their accepted manuscript in a public repository immediately, under the terms of a Creative Commons Attribution licence (CC BY), or (ii) that are covered by a transformative agreement that has a clear and time-specified commitment to transition to full open access."
What is the impact of Plan S on WHO’s open-access policy?,WHO’s open-access policy will be updated in 2020 in accordance with the principles and implementation guidance of Plan S. The revised policy will enter into force on 1 January 2021. WHO will also update its grant agreements to reflect the new policy requirements.
"If I am a recipient of WHO funding, do I need to follow the requirements of Plan S?","If you submit your article to the journal publisher before 1 January 2021, the current WHO open-access policy will apply.

What sort of supplies are in a standard emergency health kit?,"WHO has standardized medicines and medical supplies needed in emergencies to allow swift, efficient and effective response to the need for medicines and medical supplies. This has led to the supply of standard, pre-packed kits that can be kept in readiness to meet priority health needs in emergency.WHO uses standardized medical kits of different profiles. They are primarily intended for affected or displaced populations without medical facilities. They can also be used for initial supply of primary health care facilities where the normal system of provision has broken down.The most common emergency health kits are:Trauma Emergency and Surgery Kit (TESK 2019) Replaces the trauma A&B, SSK and Anaesthetic kit. To guide you during the transition phase to the TESK 2019, please read the technicalnote available on the WHO kit website: https://www.who.int/emergencies/supplies/trauma-emergency-surgery-kit-who-tesk-2019Target and use:The TESK 2019 kit aims at providing drugs and health supplies meeting the needs of 50 patients requiring surgical care in emergency situations, (average of 2 operations per patient = 100 interventions).The kit is composed of several sets and each set can be requested as stand-alone.The TESK 2017, composed of multiple sets of surgical instruments, remains unchanged and is complementary to the TESK 2019.SHW Travel kit 2020Revision of content and new conceptTarget and use:Composed of 3 modules: module 1: supplies, module 2: medicines, module 3: medicines for the field (mainly antibiotics) and a carry bag.

How do people catch Zika virus?,"Zika virus is primarily transmitted to people through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, which can also transmit chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever.Zika virus can also be transmitted through sex and has been detected in semen, blood, urine, amniotic fluids, saliva as well as body fluids found in the brain and spinal cord.Zika virus may present a risk to blood safety. People who have donated blood are encouraged to report to the blood transfusion service if they subsequently get symptoms of Zika virus infection, or if they are diagnosed with recent Zika virus infection within 14 days after blood donation.Fact sheet on Zika virusMaintaining a safe and adequate blood supply during Zika virus outbreaks"
What are the symptoms of Zika virus disease?,"Zika virus usually causes mild illness. Symptoms most commonly include a slight fever or rash, appearing a few days after a person is bitten by an infected mosquito. Although many will not develop any symptoms at all, others may also suffer from conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, and feel tired. The symptoms usually last from 2 to 7 days.There is no known difference in the symptoms of infected pregnant and non-pregnant women.Interim case definition of Zika virus disease"
How is Zika virus disease diagnosed?,"Diagnosis is based on symptoms and the person’s recent history (e.g. mosquito bites, or travel to an area where Zika virus occurs). Laboratory testing can confirm the presence of Zika virus in the blood. However, this diagnosis may not be reliable as the virus could cross-react with other viruses such as dengue, West Nile and yellow fever. The development of a reliable, rapid point-of-care diagnostic test is high priority for Zika-related research.Surveillance for Zika virus infection, microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndromeLaboratory testing for Zika virus infection"
How is Zika virus disease treated?,"The symptoms of Zika virus disease can be treated with common pain and fever medicines, rest and plenty of water. If symptoms worsen, people should seek medical advice."
Why do we need a Zika virus country classification scheme?,Public health agencies like WHO classify countries to characterize the level of Zika virus transmission in a given time and the potential for its spread. This information enables countries to prepare and respond to the threat and adapt public health recommendations for residents and travellers.
Why does the scheme only take into consideration the presence in a country of the Aedes aegypti mosquito and not of other mosquitoes?,"The Aedes aegypti mosquito is considered the main vector of Zika virus transmission because it sustains most Zika virus outbreaks. Zika virus may be imported by infected travellers into an area that may not have Zika virus transmission at that point of time. If those travellers are bitten by local Aedes aegypti mosquitoes the mosquitoes can transmit the virus to others, potentially setting off a cycle of transmission. Studies on the role of other species of mosquitoes in human transmission are inconclusive so far."
What are the categories in the Zika virus country classification scheme?,"Category 1: Area with new introduction of Zika virus since 2015 or area where the virus has been re-introduced, with ongoing transmission.Category 2: Area either with evidence of Zika virus circulation before 2015 or with transmission but the area does not satisfy the criteria for 1 or 3. Areas in category 2 may also experience an outbreak of Zika.Category 3: Area with interrupted transmission but with potential for future transmission.Category 4: Area with established Aedes aegypti mosquitoes but no known documented past or current transmission."
What are the public health implications of this classification?,"WHO strongly encourages all countries with Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, whether they ever had Zika virus transmission or not, to enhance early warning systems for Zika and related severe neurological complications. Zika virus infection is usually benign. However, studies have shown that Zika virus is a cause of congenital Zika virus syndrome, a condition occurring in newborns and infants who were exposed to Zika virus before birth. To prevent congenital Zika virus syndrome, it is important to monitor trends in Zika virus infection. WHO has issued a range of guidelines to help countries prepare and respond to outbreaks of Zika virus and related complications.Publications and technical guidance on Zika virus"
How was the Zika virus country classification scheme developed?,"WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) have collaboratively reviewed surveillance data from countries and defined levels of Zika virus transmission and risk based on current evidence. As a guidance development group, they have developed the interim guidance on Zika virus country classification scheme.Zika virus country classification scheme"
What is microcephaly?,"Microcephaly is a condition where a baby’s head is smaller than those of other babies of the same age and sex. Microcephaly happens when there is either a problem in utero, causing the baby’s brain to stop growing properly, or after birth when the head stops growing properly. Children born with microcephaly often have developmental challenges as they grow older. In some cases, children with microcephaly develop entirely normally. Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of environmental and genetic factors such as Down syndrome; exposure to drugs, alcohol or other toxins in the womb; and rubella infection during pregnancy.Fact sheet on microcephalySurveillance for Zika virus infection, microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndromeScreening, assessment and management of neonates and infants with complications associated with Zika virus exposure in utero"
What is congenital Zika virus syndrome?,"In addition to congenital microcephaly, a range of manifestations has been reported among babies up to 4 weeks old where there has been exposure to Zika virus in utero. These include malformations of the head, involuntary movement, seizures, irritability, brainstem dysfunction such as swallowing problems, limb contractures, hearing and sight abnormalities and brain anomalies. Other outcomes associated with Zika virus infection in utero may involve miscarriages and stillbirths. Together, the spectrum of congenital abnormalities associated with Zika virus exposure of fetuses during pregnancy are known as “congenital Zika virus syndrome.”Not all children with congenital Zika virus syndrome present with microcephaly. On the other hand, failure to observe signs of congenital Zika virus syndrome, particularly when assessed in utero, does not necessarily mean that the fetus or newborn does not have abnormalities. For example, hearing abnormalities may not be assessed in utero but only after birth. Some signs such as seizures may develop only after birth.Screening, assessment and management of neonates and infants with complications associated with Zika virus exposure in utero"
What is Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare condition in which a person’s immune system attacks his or her nerves. People of all ages can be affected, but it is more common in adult men. Most people recover fully from even the most severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome. In 20%-30% of people with the condition, the chest muscles are affected, making it hard to breathe. Severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome are rare, but can result in near-total paralysis and/or death.Fact sheet on Guillain-Barré syndromeIdentification and management of Guillain-Barré syndrome in the context of Zika virusSurveillance for Zika virus infection, microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome"
What is the relationship between Zika and microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"Based on a newly published systematic review of current research, WHO has reaffirmed its position that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, and refined its position on the relationship between Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome, stating that Zika virus infection is a trigger of Guillain-Barré syndrome.Zika causality statement"
What events led WHO to investigate a causal link between Zika virus and complications including microcephaly and Guillian-Barré syndrome?,"A Zika outbreak in Brazil, identified in early 2015, was followed by an unusual increase in microcephaly among newborns, as well as an increased number of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Zika virus outbreaks rapidly affected other countries and territories in the Americas. The scientific community responded with urgency to the rapidly evolving situation and began building a knowledge base about the virus and its implications extremely quickly.In 2013-2014, Zika virus had caused an outbreak in French Polynesia with some 28 000 people infected with Zika, including cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome. The outbreaks in the Americas led to a reinvestigation of the 2013-14 outbreak in French Polynesia. Looking back, this outbreak appears to have been linked also to microcephaly.Research into the geographical spread of Zika virus and related complications continues."
Are there other explanations for microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly are conditions with a number of underlying causes, triggers and neurological effects. Microcephaly can result, among others, from infections during pregnancy, exposure to toxic chemicals and genetic abnormalities.Guillain-Barré syndrome is often preceded by an infection. This could be a bacterial or viral infection. The syndrome may also be triggered by vaccine administration or surgery.Scientists do not exclude the possibility that other factors may combine with Zika virus infection to cause neurological disorders. A better understanding of Zika virus infection and its complications is one of the remaining research priorities.WHO Zika Virus Research AgendaR&D Blueprint for action to Prevent Epidemics"
Where does Zika virus occur?,"Local transmission of Zika virus by Aedes mosquitoes has been reported on the continents of Africa, the Americas, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific.There are 2 types of Aedes mosquito known to be capable of transmitting Zika virus. In most cases, Zika is spread through the Aedes aegypti mosquito in tropical and subtropical regions. The Aedes albopictus mosquito can also transmit the virus and can hibernate to survive regions with cooler temperatures. Both species breed and live near or inside human dwellings, preferring to bite humans over other animal hosts.A study, conducted by Fiocruz Pernambuco, detected the presence of Zika virus in Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. Recent laboratory studies have shown that Culex species were unable to transmit Zika virus in an experimental setting. It is unlikely that they play a role in the current outbreak of Zika.Mosquito-borne diseasesA review of Zika vectors - Aedes"
Can the Aedes mosquito travel from country to country and region to region?,The Aedes mosquito is a weak flyer; it cannot fly more than 400 meters. However it may be possible for the mosquito to be transported from one place to another accidentally and introduce Zika virus to new areas.WHO Ad-hoc Advisory Group on aircraft disinsection for controlling the international spread of vector-borne diseases
What role does mosquito surveillance play in addressing Zika virus?,"Monitoring the numbers and the geographical distribution of mosquitoes over time (surveillance) helps to make timely decisions about how best to manage mosquito populations.Surveillance can serve to identify areas where a high-density infestation of mosquitoes has occurred or periods when mosquito populations increase. In areas where the mosquitoes are no longer present, mosquito surveillance is critical to detect new introductions rapidly before they become widespread and difficult to eliminate.Monitoring of the mosquito population’s susceptibility to insecticide should also be an integral part of any programme that uses insecticides which are substances to kill insects. Surveillance is a critical component of prevention and control programmes as it provides the information necessary for risk assessment, epidemic response and programme evaluation.Entomological surveillance for Aedes spp. in the context of Zika virus: Interim guidance for entomologistsMonitoring and managing insecticide resistance in Aedes mosquito populations"
What role does mosquito control play in addressing Zika virus?,"Mosquito control is an important component of the prevention and management of Zika virus and complications. WHO encourages affected countries and their partners to scale up the use of current mosquito control interventions as the most immediate line of defence. WHO recommends approaches that tackle all life stages of the Aedes mosquito, from the egg, to the larva/pupa to the adult.Current interventions include: targeted residual spraying of adult Aedes mosquitoes in and around houses; space spraying/indoor fogging where Aedes mosquitoes rest and bite and outside; elimination of Aedes mosquito larvae in standing water breeding sites and personal protection from mosquito bites. If current methods are implemented in an expedient, comprehensive and sustained way, with community participation, along with other measures, mosquito control can be effective. In addition, WHO encourages countries and their partners to judiciously test new control tools that could potentially be applied in the future.WHO's vector control recommendations targeting the Aedes species are also very efficient against other mosquito vectors. The range of methods for reducing mosquitos include spraying the inside walls of houses, indoor space spraying, larval control and eliminating breeding sites. Mosquito control is recommended along with personal protection steps such as the use of insect repellents, bed nets during the day and at night, window and door netting and wire mesh screens.Dispelling rumours around Zika and complicationsProtecting the health and safety of workers in emergency vector control of Aedes mosquitoesVector control operations framework for Zika virus"
What can people do to protect themselves from mosquito bites?,"The best protection from Zika virus and associated complications is preventing mosquito bites. This can be done by:• Wearing clothes (preferably light-coloured) that cover as much of the body as possible.• Using repellents that contain DEET (diethyltoluamide), IR 3535 ((3- [N-butyl-N-acetyl], aminopropionic acid ethyl-ester) or KBR3023 (also called Icaridin or Picaridin). These are applied to exposed skin or to clothing and should be used in strict accordance with the label instructions, especially regarding the duration of protection and timing of re-application. If repellents and sunscreen are used together, sunscreen should be applied first and the repellent thereafter. Using physical barriers such mesh screens or treated netting materials on doors and windows.• Sleeping under mosquito nets day and night.• Identifying and eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites, by emptying, cleaning or covering containers that can hold even small amounts of water, such as buckets, flower pots and tyres.• National programmes can target polluted water bodies and sewage wastes (septic tank outlets need to be covered) with water and sanitation interventions."
How can pregnant women protect themselves from mosquito bites?,"Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant and their sexual partners should take extra care to protect themselves from the bite of mosquitoes that transmit Zika. Pregnant women living in areas of Zika virus transmission should follow the same prevention guidelines as the general population (see question above).There is no evidence of health risks associated with the use of insect repellents that contain DEET (diethyltoluamide), or IR 3535, or icaridin by pregnant women as long as they are used in accordance with the instructions on the product label.Pregnant women living in areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission should attend their regular antenatal care visits in accordance with national standards and comply with the recommendations of their health-care providers. They should also start antenatal care visits early for diagnosis and appropriate care and follow-up if they develop any of the Zika symptoms or signs."
What can people do to be protected from sexual transmission of Zika virus?,"In regions with active Zika virus transmission, health programmes should ensure that:All people (male and female) with Zika virus infection and their sexual partners (particularly pregnant women) receive information about the risks of sexual transmission of Zika virus.Men and women get counselling on safer sexual practices (including correct and consistent use of male or female condoms, non-penetrative sex, reducing the number of sexual partners, and postponing sexual debut) and be offered condoms.Sexually active men and women should be correctly counselled and offered a full range of contraceptive methods to be able to make an informed choice about whether and when to become pregnant, in order to prevent possible adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes.Pregnant women practice safer sex or abstain from sexual activity for at least the whole duration of the pregnancy.Pregnant women should be advised not to travel to areas of ongoing Zika virus outbreaks.In regions with NO active Zika virus transmission health programmes should ensure that:Men and women returning from areas where transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should adopt safer sex practices or consider abstinence for at least 6 months upon return to prevent Zika virus infection through sexual transmission.Couples or women planning a pregnancy, who are returning from areas where transmission of Zika virus is known to occur, are advised to wait at least 6 months before trying to conceive to ensure that possible Zika virus infection has cleared.Sexual partners of pregnant women, returning from areas where transmission of Zika virus is known to occur, should be advised to practice safer sex or abstain from sexual activity for at least the whole duration of the pregnancy.Fact sheet: Family planning/ContraceptionUNFPA, WHO and UNAIDS Statement on condoms & prevention of HIV, other STIs and unintended pregnancyPrevention of potential sexual transmission of Zika virus, interim guidance"
What should women do if they have been exposed to unprotected sex but do not wish to become pregnant because of possible infection with Zika?,"All women and girls should have ready access to emergency contraception, including accurate information and counselling as well as affordable methods.Fact sheet: Emergency contraception"
Who might be targeted for vaccination against Zika?,"In emergencies, we focus on the prevention of the most devastating disease manifestation which, in the context of Zika, is congenital Zika virus syndrome. This is a condition occurring in newborns and infants who were exposed to Zika virus infection in utero. For this reason, the priority population to protect through vaccination is women of childbearing age. If resources permit, males of reproductive age would be a second target population.Zika vaccine target product profile"
What steps are required to ensure that a vaccine is safe and effective?,"A number of steps must take place to ensure that vaccines for any disease are safe and effective. The precise requirements depend on the national authority responsible for regulating the approval and licensing of vaccines, the severity of disease, the amount and distribution of disease and the target population. In the case of Zika, after a rigorous evaluation in pre-clinical studies, candidate Zika vaccines will be tested in small numbers of volunteers (Phase I and Phase II trials) to test the vaccine’s safety and its ability and the dosage needed to produce sufficient immune response while minimizing any side effects. Phase II and III trials need to demonstrate that the vaccine works to protect the target population.WHO consultation on regulatory considerations for Zika vaccine for emergency use"
What is the current status of Zika vaccine development?,"WHO is tracking Zika vaccine candidates in the research and development pipeline. We look at databases of clinical trials being conducted and published studies and inquire with developers as to where they are in the process – from basic research to clinical evaluation to regulatory approval to production to commercialization. As of January 2017, about 40 Zika vaccine candidates are in the pipeline. Five of them are entering, or about to enter, Phase I trials in which the vaccine’s safety and ability to produce an immune response is being evaluated. Several other candidates are expected to move to Phase I trials in the coming months.Vaccine pipeline tracker"
How is WHO expediting Zika vaccine R&D?,"The Zika R&D activities are coordinated under WHO’s R&D Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics. This is a strategic plan which allows the R&D community and regulators to fast-track the availability of effective diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives for diseases for which few or no medical countermeasures exist. Zika is one of a number of priority diseases to benefit from the Blueprint.BlueprintList of priority diseases"
When might a Zika vaccine be available?,Registration of first generation Zika vaccines may start in about 2-3 years. Many regulatory authorities have fast-track mechanisms for review and approval of urgently needed vaccines.
What are the characteristics of an ideal Zika vaccine?,"WHO is helping to shape vaccine development through the creation of a target product profile for Zika vaccines for use in an emergency. The profile specifies the preferred and minimal product characteristics for such vaccines. For example, administration of a single dose of Zika vaccine is preferable, but up to 2 doses are acceptable. The vaccine should protect for at least one year in an emergency context, but protection for several years is preferable. The shelf life of a vaccine should be at least 12 months at less than 20°C.Target product profile"
What are the challenges in Zika vaccine R&D?,"Developing a Zika vaccine is complex. For example, we still face many unknowns about Zika virus disease and its complications. Evaluating candidate vaccines in areas with low Zika virus transmission is not easy. We need to develop diagnostic tests which can differentiate Zika infection from other similar viral infections. Getting a safe and effective Zika vaccine to women of childbearing age could, however, be technically feasible based on experience with vaccine development for other similar viruses, such as yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis."
What happens once a vaccine is available?,"Once a vaccine is available, WHO’s leading advisory group on immunization, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, performs a comprehensive review of the evidence and makes recommendations to the WHO Director-General for the optimal use of a vaccine for public health impact. WHO issues official recommendations based on the SAGE recommendations, which permit the prequalification and purchase by UN agencies."
Can women transmit Zika virus to their fetuses during pregnancy or childbirth?,"Transmission of Zika virus from pregnant women to their fetuses has been documented.Although Zika virus infection in pregnancy is typically a mild disease, an unusual increase in cases of congenital microcephaly and other neurological complications in areas where outbreaks have occurred has significantly raised concern for pregnant women and their families, as well as among health providers and policy-makers. Pregnant women in general, including those who develop symptoms of Zika virus infection, should see their health-care provider for close monitoring of their pregnancy.Pregnancy management in the context of Zika virus infection"
What should women do if they wish to postpone pregnancy because they are worried about microcephaly?,"Whether and when to become pregnant should be a personal decision, made on the basis of full information and access to affordable, quality health services.Women wanting to postpone pregnancy should have access to a comprehensive range of reversible, long- or short-acting contraceptive options. They should also be counselled on the dual protection against sexually transmitted infections provided by condoms.There are no known safety concerns regarding the use of any hormonal or barrier contraceptive methods for women or adolescent girls at risk of Zika virus, women diagnosed with Zika virus infection, or women and adolescents being treated for Zika virus infection.Pregnancy management in the context of Zika virus infectionEnsuring human rights in the provision of contraceptive information and services - Guidance and recommendationsAdvice for health-care providers on medical eligibility for contraception"
How can women manage their pregnancy in the context of Zika virus and complications?,"Most women in Zika-affected areas will give birth to normal infants.Early ultrasound does not reliably predict fetal malformations. WHO recommends a repeat ultrasound of the fetus in the late second or early third trimester (preferably between 28 and 30 weeks) to identify fetal microcephaly and/or other brain abnormalities when they are easier to detect.Where feasible, screening of amniotic fluid for abnormalities and congenital infections, including Zika virus, is recommended, especially in cases where women test negative for Zika, but their ultrasounds indicate fetal brain abnormalities.Based on the prognosis of associated fetal brain abnormalities, the woman—and her partner if she wishes—should be offered non-directive counselling so that she, in consultation with her health-care provider, can make a fully informed choice about the next steps in the management of her pregnancy.Women carrying their pregnancy to term should receive appropriate care and support to manage anxiety, stress and the birth environment. Plans for care and management of the baby soon after birth should be discussed with the parents in consultation with a paediatrician or paediatric neurologist where available.Women who wish to discontinue the pregnancy should receive accurate information about their options to the full extent of the law, including harm reduction where the care desired is not readily available.Women, whatever their individual choices with respect to their pregnancies, must be treated with respect and dignity.Pregnancy management in the context of Zika virus infectionPsychosocial support for pregnant women and for families with microcephaly and other neurological complications in the context of Zika virusSafe abortion: Technical & policy guidance for health systems.

What triggers an asthma attack?,"Asthma is a chronic breathing disorder characterized by 
recurrent attacks of breathlessness and wheezing. Some causes and 
triggers are common to all people with asthma, and some are more 
individual. Although the fundamental causes of asthma are not completely
 understood, the strongest risk factors for developing asthma are 
inhaled asthma triggers. These include:


indoor allergens (for example house dust mites in bedding, carpets and stuffed furniture, pollution and pet dander); outdoor allergens (such as pollens and moulds);tobacco smoke; andchemical irritants in the workplace. Other triggers can include cold air, extreme emotional arousal
 such as anger or fear, and physical exercise. In some people, asthma 
can even be triggered by certain medications, such as aspirin and other 
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, and beta-blockers (which are used 
to treat high blood pressure, heart conditions and migraine). 
Urbanization has also been associated with an increase in asthma, 
however the exact nature of this relationship is unclear.According to WHO estimates, 339 million people suffer from 
asthma globally. Although asthma cannot be cured, appropriate management
 can control the disorder and enable people to enjoy good quality of 
life.  In addition, some children with milder forms of asthma outgrow 
their symptoms with age."
What is the WHO malaria NAAT EQA scheme?,"The purpose of the WHO malaria NAAT EQA scheme is to offer an independent and periodic means for clinical, reference and research laboratories to verify the quality of their nucleic acid amplification (NAA)-based malaria diagnostic methods and to monitor performance over time. This is achieved through the provision of well-characterized and quality-controlled panels consisting of a blinded mix of Plasmodium-positive and -negative samples. Participants are then issued an EQA report upon submission of their analysis results. Participation in the scheme is voluntary, and results are confidential.The WHO malaria NAAT EQA scheme is coordinated by the WHO's Global Malaria Programme and distributed by the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service (UK NEQAS), with a priority given to not-for-profit laboratories based in developing countries. Participation so far is free of charge.The scheme will enable laboratories to obtain an independent assessment of their NAA-based diagnostic methods in order to determine if they meet the minimum level of quality required. If any laboratory does not meet this requirement, some level of remote technical support will be offered. The laboratory will have the opportunity work on identifying and addressing any source of error in order to improve the quality and reliability of its methods."
Who can participate in the WHO NAAT EQA scheme?,"Any laboratory using NAA-based methods such as nested PCR, RT-PCR, LAMP or NASBA to detect malaria parasites is eligible for enrolment in the WHO NAAT EQA scheme. However, given that the scheme is currently run with limited funding, priority is given on a first come, first serve basis to not-for-profit laboratories based in developing countries, with the aim to generate a balance of laboratories according to testing indication, i.e. research, surveillance/surveys and geography. Laboratories wishing to participate should send a message to [email protected]. In addition, calls for interest in participation are sent out to potentially interested laboratories, and enrolment is complete once favourable responses are received and letters of agreement between WHO and the participating laboratories are signed.Besides offering the free WHO NAAT EQA scheme coordinated by WHO, UK NEQAS also coordinates its own malaria molecular scheme that is subject to fees for participation ( http://www.ukneqasmicro.org.uk/parasitology/index.php/molecular-detection-of-malaria). Laboratories should participate in either the WHO scheme or the UK NEQAS scheme, but not both at the same time."
What is the frequency of panel distributions?,"The WHO NAAT EQA scheme distributes EQA panels twice a year, usually once at the end of January and once at the end of July. Exact dates depend on the practical organization of the scheme, i.e. the readiness of panels and capacity at UK NEQAS. Dates are confirmed by e-mail communication when calls for interest in participation are sent out, usually about 4–8 weeks ahead of each round of panel distributions."
Who is organizing the WHO NAAT EQA scheme?,"The WHO malaria NAAT EQA scheme is coordinated by WHO, in collaboration with Public Health England (PHE) through UK NEQAS, with support from the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND). WHO is responsible for the overall coordination and promotion of the scheme, while UK NEQAS holds the central repository of EQA materials and manages the scheme operations. This includes the preparation, characterization, storage and shipping of EQA panels; the issuance of EQA reports to the participating laboratories; and the handling of any logistical queries. The EQA panels undergo independent testing by referee laboratories before being distributed to the laboratories participating in the scheme.Currently, FIND provides financial support to the overall scheme and remote technical support to the participating laboratories, if required. WHO also organizes regular meetings (at least yearly) of an Advisory Group to review the scheme procedures, provide technical expertise for potential modifications to procedures and principles, review overall results of the scheme, including complaints, and discuss actions required to address major issues, if any."
How can I get enrolled in the WHO NAAT scheme?,"Interest in participation can be communicated by e-mail at any time to the WHO/GMP contact at [email protected]. Calls for interest in participation are also sent out by e-mail to potentially interested laboratories about 4–8 weeks before each round of panel distributions. A Letter of Agreement (LOA) and laboratory profile template are issued to the interested institution or organization.The laboratory profile template requires participants to provide contact and shipping information (including special requirements such as permits for importation of biological samples), and to describe the laboratory’s capacity for identifying Plasmodium spp. It, along with the LOA (between the participating laboratory and WHO), needs to be completed and sent back to [email protected]. Once the LOA has been signed by both parties and the laboratory profile is complete, the laboratory is registered in the scheme for an unlimited period of time. The laboratory will receive login details to connect to the UK NEQAS webportal for the WHO NAAT EQA scheme, and will be contacted ahead of each round of panel distributions to organize shipments."
What is a laboratory profile template and why am I being asked for this?,"The laboratory profile is a template that contains a series of questions to be completed before a laboratory can enrol in the WHO NAAT EQA scheme. Its purpose is to clarify which types of malaria diagnosis will be done on the EQA panels at the laboratory, i.e. which nucleic acid extraction and amplification methods will be used, and most importantly, the laboratory’s capacity in terms of diagnostic outputs, e.g. detection of Plasmodium spp. only or additional identification of species, including P. knowlesi or not.The scheme organizers need this critical information in order to accurately calculate success scores when laboratories submit their EQA testing results. Correct completion of the laboratory profile is mandatory for enrolment in the WHO NAAT EQA scheme."
Can mothers with Zika infection breastfeed their baby?,"WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, also in the context of Zika virus. Zika virus has been detected in breast milk but there is currently no evidence that the virus is transmitted to babies through breastfeeding.Breastfeeding in the context of Zika virus"
What should people travelling to Zika-affected areas do?,"Travellers should stay informed about Zika virus and other mosquito-borne diseases such as chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever, and consult their local health or travel authorities if they are concerned.Pregnant women should be advised not to travel to areas of ongoing Zika virus outbreaks; pregnant women whose sexual partners live in or travel to areas with Zika virus transmission should ensure safer sexual practices or abstain from sex for the duration of their pregnancy.Information for travellers visiting Zika affected countriesTravel advice for health authorities"
What is WHO's response to Zika?,"Zika virus and its complications such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome represent a new type of public health threat with long-term consequences for families, communities and countries. WHO and partners support countries in preparing for and responding to Zika to the fullest extent possible. The main pillars of their work, as outlined in the Zika Strategic Response Plan, July 2016 to December 2017, are:• Detection - Develop, strengthen and implement integrated surveillance systems for Zika virus disease, its neurological complications and other diseases that are transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. This helps to measure burden of disease to guide sound public health interventions.• Prevention - Prevent complications associated with Zika virus infection through mosquito control that prevents the Aedes mosquito from transmitting Zika virus, chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever to humans; communicate risks to people’s health and engage communities in prevention activities.• Care and support - Strengthen health and social systems to provide appropriate services and support to individuals, families and communities affected by Zika and related complications.• Research – 1) Generate data and evidence needed to strengthen public health and community guidance and interventions to prevent, detect and control Zika virus infection and to manage its complications. 2) Fast track and scale up the research, development and availability of Aedes mosquito control tools, diagnostic tests and vaccines.• Coordination – WHO coordinates the Zika response through close collaboration with more than 60 partners and facilitates information sharing among them and with countries.More on WHO's Strategic Response PlanZika situation report (data on occurrence and/or spread of Zika virus, microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome)Risk communication"
What does WHO recommend countries to do?,"WHO is supporting countries in the areas of detection, prevention, care and support and R&D in line with the Zika Strategic Response Plan. Furthermore, WHO has issued technical guidance for policy-makers and health-care professionals in critical areas of preparedness and response. As listed under the respective questions above, recommendations range from how to provide psychosocial support to pregnant women and families affected by Zika and neurological complications, to how to diagnose Zika virus infection in laboratories to how to protect the health and safety of workers in emergency mosquito control.Zika Strategic Response PlanPublications, technical guidance on Zika virus"
Do I need to pay to participate in the scheme?,"Participation in the scheme is currently free of charge; the laboratory simply has to cover any costs associated with the reception of the panels (e.g. customs charges, travel to nearest airport) and the testing itself.However, to ensure the long-term sustainability of the scheme, the implementation of a participation fee is planned for the near future to cover at least part of the running costs of the scheme. The fee will be determined based on a dedicated cost estimation model."
What is the composition of the EQA panels?,"Currently, the panel includes 10 lyophilized blood (LB) and 10 dried blood spot (DBS) samples. Malaria-containing samples have varying parasite densities, ranging from 50 to 2 000 000 parasites per microliter of blood (p/mL). Parasite-positive samples can be from any of the five species known to infect humans, i.e. P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale or P. knowlesi, depending on availability. The lyophilized and DBS samples do not share the same composition, i.e. different species and/or parasite densities can be included."
How are the panels prepared?,"Briefly, parasites are obtained either through in vitro culture of laboratory strains – in the case of P. falciparum and P. knowlesi – or by using leftover blood from clinical samples. Parasite-negative blood for negative control samples and for the dilution of parasites is obtained from accredited blood banks and pre-screened by PCR to confirm the absence of Plasmodium parasites.After determining the densities of the cultured or clinical parasite samples by expert microscopy, they are diluted with parasite-negative blood to parasite densities ranging from 50 to 2 000 000 p/mL. Samples are mixed thoroughly at each dilution step. To prepare LB samples, dilutions are then aliquoted in 500 µL volumes and lyophilized. To prepare DBS samples, 50 µL volumes are deposited on Protein Saver 903 DBS cards and air-dried for 3–4 hours. All samples are stored at -80°C for long-term storage, but can be shipped and transported at ambient temperature.A more detailed description of the preparation procedures can be found in the Operational Manual of the WHO NAAT EQA scheme, version 1.0."
What method should I use for testing the panels?,"Each laboratory should test the panels using the extraction and amplification methods that it routinely uses for testing clinical or research study samples. Laboratories are permitted to submit only one result per sample. Laboratories are requested to provide information on the methods used, such as the test’s name or kit details, along with their final result in the online results submission form. Repeat testing should only be done in the case of indeterminate results or suspicion of methodological errors, just as would be done routinely for any clinical or research study sample."
What if I get substandard scoring results?,"An incident review form is available online from the UK NEQAS website. Laboratories receiving substandard results should complete this form and send it to the scheme manager at [email protected], with copy to the WHO contact at [email protected]. Laboratories can also request a repeat panel to be shipped for re-testing and further investigation, at the same e-mail addresses. Additional remote technical support is currently provided by FIND (until 30 June 2018) and by members of the WHO Advisory Group and/or representatives of the referee laboratories if their time and workload allow. It is the participating laboratory’s right to decide if its EQA results can be shared with these third-party sources of technical support, as well as other information such as instruments or reagents used and results from any repeat or troubleshooting experiments generated through this investigational process.It is the participating laboratory’s right to decide if its EQA results can be shared with these third-party sources of technical support, as well as other information such as instruments or reagents used and results from any repeat or troubleshooting experiments generated through this investigational process.From time to time, webinars will be organized to give registered laboratories the opportunity to ask questions from a panel of experts in the field of molecular-based malaria diagnostics.Ultimately, it is the laboratory’s responsibility to investigate and address any problems. Sponsors of the laboratory should consider allocating appropriate resources to improve the quality management system (QMS) of the laboratory, as required."
Are results kept confidential?,"Yes. All testing results are kept strictly confidential; only the laboratory itself can access them through the UK NEQAS webportal using its specific login and password. Otherwise, only staff from the scheme’s organizing team can access individual results for the purposes of data analysis and reporting. Only anonymized and aggregated results will be used for publication or communication to the scheme’s Advisory Group.If substandard results require any remedial action or technical support, the scheme organizers will first seek the laboratory’s interest and approval to involve any third parties such as technical staff from FIND or members of the Advisory Group. If the laboratory agrees, test results will then be communicated to facilitate troubleshooting and remediation."
Can I communicate my results to others?,"Each laboratory is free to communicate part or all of its testing results to any third party without the need to inform WHO or UK NEQAS. Communication of the scheme results is encouraged in order to confirm the laboratory’s performance level for potential collaborators, donors, regulatory authorities and others. Communication of substandard results is also encouraged in order to seek assistance or funding for training workshops, and to work on improving the laboratory’s performance."
How can I get help if facing problems with the webpage?,"Participants can send an e-mail to the UK NEQAS scheme manager at [email protected], with a description of the problem, screenshots or other useful information."
How can I get help to improve my performance?,"As described under the question ‘what if I get substandard results’, the laboratory can request a repeat panel to be shipped for re-testing and further investigation of the reasons behind the bad results. Repeat panels can be requested by contacting the scheme manager at [email protected], with copy to the WHO contact at [email protected]. Remote technical support can also be offered by FIND (until 30 June 2018) and/or staff from the referee laboratories of the scheme and the WHO Advisory Group, depending on availability.It is nevertheless the laboratory’s responsibility to work on improving its performance and solving any quality issues. Therefore, other options should also be considered, including participating in training workshops, working with collaborating laboratories, investing in an improved QMS, and so on."
What happens if I drop a specimen vial by mistake?,"If a specimen vial from the EQA panel set gets damaged, dropped or lost for some reason, the scheme can send repeat specimens. For this, the laboratory can simply contact the scheme manager at [email protected], with copy to the WHO contact at [email protected], explaining the reason for the request and specifying how many vials of which specimen are required. As the scheme is run with limited funding, this offer of repeat specimens should be used sparingly, only in the case of real need."
Is the WHO NAAT EQA scheme accredited to any ISO standards?,"The WHO NAAT EQA scheme is conducted at the same quality standard as UK NEQAS’s own molecular malaria scheme. UK NEQAS holds a UKAS accreditation in accordance with ISO 17043: 2010, which means that all laboratory procedures, processes, infrastructure, staff, data, documents etc. are managed according to well-defined procedures and at a high level of quality, as defined by the ISO 17043: 2010 standard."
What is a mass gathering?,"A mass gathering is a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending could strain the planning and response resources of the community or country hosting the event. The Olympic Games, The Hajj, and other major sporting, religious, and cultural events are all examples of a mass gathering.Mass gatherings may stretch health systems beyond their capacity; however, these events also present opportunities for long-lasting positive effects such as a stronger public health systems after the event, or residents and visitors that are better informed about how they can protect themselves from certain diseases."
What is WHO’s role in mass gatherings?,"WHO provides advice and technical support to host governments preparing for mass gathering events.The goal is to make large international events as safe as possible from public health risks and to encourage a positive public health legacy from these events. This includes lessons learnt for future mass gathering events and an improved health system in the host country.For example, WHO, PAHO and Public Health England, WHO Collaborating Centre in Mass Gatherings and Global Health Security, have been providing expertise to the government of Brazil on planning for mass gatherings since 2012, including the FIFA World Cup in 2014 and the Rio 2016 Games."
What kind of mass gatherings is WHO working on?,"WHO has provided public health assessments, guidance and advice for a range of cultural, religious and sports mass gatherings.For example, the WHO Office for the European Region provided advice and technical support to WHO Member States that hosted the London 2012 Olympic Games, the 2012 UEFA European Football Championships in Poland and Ukraine and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russian Federation.WHO has also provided advice and technical support to Saudi Arabia for The Hajj, in particular with respect to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The Hajj is the largest annual recurring mass gathering event, which attracts roughly 10 million people from more than 180 countries across the globe."
How does WHO provide support to Member States for mass gatherings?,"To provide advice and technical support to Member States that are hosting mass gatherings, WHO draws on 5 WHO Collaborating Centres for Mass Gatherings and a Virtual Interdisciplinary Advisory Group (VIAG). VIAG is an informal network of mass gathering experts. Their role is to share expertise on public health requirements and best practices with any organization considering hosting a mass gathering event.Activities to support host governments of mass gatherings often include:Prior to the event: all-hazard risk assessment, travel medicine and activities to encourage increased physical activity, cessation of tobacco use and avoidance of excess alcohol.During the event: international monitoring of potential disease spread and risk assessment, emergency medical services and hospitals and plans to manage fan zones.After the event: capture lessons learnt and share expertise with future mass gathering hosts.For example, for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa, WHO and other organizations helped the Department of Health of South Africa to design the reporting and oversight methodology for establishing health operations centres at the national and provincial level."
What governs WHO’s work on mass gatherings?,"WHO’s work on mass gatherings was strengthened by a 2011 decision of the WHO Executive Board and the International Health Regulations (2005).The decision states that the WHO ""Director-General should, where appropriate, work closely with Member States that are planning and conducting mass gatherings to support cooperation and communication between the concerned health authorities in each country, and help Member States strengthen capacities to better utilize the International Health Regulations (2005)"".The International Health Regulations (2005) mandate that, ""WHO works with Member States to develop the necessary policies, measures and instruments for managing the potential public health risks associated with mass gathering events."""
Does WHO have the power to cancel or move mass gatherings?,"The decision to cancel, restrict, modify or proceed with any mass gathering event can only be made based on an event - and country-specific risk assessment conducted by the organizers of the event.WHO may provide advice and technical guidance to host countries on public health risks, but has no decision power to uphold, cancel or postpone mass gatherings hosted by Member States."
Why is emergency risk communication guidance needed?,"During public health emergencies, people need to know what health risks they face, and what actions they can take to protect their lives, their health, their families and communities.Accurate information, provided early, often, and in language and channels people understand, trust and use, enables people to make choices that can protect them from health hazards threatening their lives and well-being."
What is new about this guidance?,"WHO has manuals, training modules and other forms of emergency communication and risk communication guidance based on expert opinion or lessons drawn from major environmental disasters, such as the SARS outbreak of 2003 and the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009, rather than systematic analysis of the evidence. This is the first ever evidence-based risk communications guidance.The recommendations in this guidance are based on a systematic search of the evidence on key issues in emergency risk communication practice and experience. Not only was the academic structured evidence searched but also ‘grey literature’ to ensure that the lessons learned from recent emergencies, such as the West African Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2014–2015 and the global Zika virus outbreak in 2015–2016, were captured and explored fully.Evidence for decision making"
Who should use this guidance?,"These guidelines were developed for policy- and decision-makers responsible for managing emergencies, particularly the public health aspects of emergencies, and practitioners responsible for risk communication before, during and after health emergencies.Other groups expected to use these guidelines are front-line responders, local, national and international development partners, civil society, the private sector and all organizations, private and public, involved in emergency preparedness and response."
What are they key recommendations in this guidance?,"These guidelines provide WHO Member States, partners and stakeholders involved in emergency preparedness and response with evidence-based, up-to-date, systems-focused guidance on:building trust and engaging with communities and affected populations;integrating risk communication into existing national and local emergency preparedness and response structures, including building capacity for risk communication;emergency risk communication practice - from planning, messaging, channels and methods of communication and engagement to monitoring and evaluation - based on a systematic assessment of the evidence on what worked and what did not work during recent emergencies."
How should these guidelines be used?,"The recommendations in these guidelines provide overarching, evidence-based guidance on how risk communication should be practiced in an emergency. The recommendations also guide countries to build capacity for communicating risk during health emergencies. Specific ‘how-to-do-it’ step-by-step instructions are beyond the remit of these guidelines. However, in due course, these will be provided in detailed manuals, standard operating procedures, pocket guides, checklists, training modules and other tools developed to elaborate the recommendations."
What is the deadliest disease in the world?,"The results of ranking the leading causes of death are subject to the cause categories used. The broader the cause categories used, the more likely they will rank among the top leading causes of death.
    According to the estimates in the Causes of death 2008 update, there were 57 million deaths in the world in 2008. The broad category of all ""noncommunicable diseases"" killed 36 million people; communicable diseases, maternal and perinatal
        conditions, and nutritional conditions killed 16 million people worldwide; and external causes of injuries killed 5 million people.The following are the leading causes of death:"
What is guinea worm? Is it a real worm?,"Guinea worm is, in fact, a real worm. It is a large nematode, Dracunculus medinensis,
 which is ingested through drinking contaminated water. The condition is
 known as dracunculiasis or guinea-worm disease. The worm eventually 
causes a debilitating and painful infection that begins with a blister, 
normally on the leg. Around the time of its eruption, the person may 
experience itching, fever, swelling, severe pain and a burning 
sensation. 
		Infected people often try to relieve the pain by immersing the
 infected part in water. If it is immersed in open water sources such as
 ponds and shallow step wells the worm emerges and releases thousands of
 larvae. The larva is ingested by a water flea (cyclop), where it 
develops and becomes infective in two weeks. When a person drinks the 
water, the cyclop is killed by the acidity of the stomach and the larva 
is freed and penetrates the gut wall. After about one year, a blister 
forms and the mature worm, one metre long, emerges thus repeating the 
life-cycle.At the beginning of the 20th century, guinea-worm disease was 
widespread in many countries in Africa and Asia. Out of 20 countries 
that were endemic worldwide in the early 1980s, only Chad, Ethiopia, and
 South Sudan – all from the African continent – are currently endemic. 
In 2015, only 251 cases were reported to WHO."
What is e-accessibility?,"Electronic accessibility, or E-Accessibility, refers to the 
ease of use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), such 
as the Internet, by people with disability. Web sites need to be 
developed so that disabled users can access the information. For 
example:
for people who are blind, web sites need to be able to be 
interpreted by programmes which read text aloud and describe any visual 
images; for people who have low vision, web pages need adjustable sized fonts and sharply contrasting colours; and for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, audio content should 
be accompanied by text versions of the dialogue. Sign language video can
 also help make audio content more accessible.
	 
Internationally, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, 
prepared by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) provide standards for 
web accessibility. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, which came into force on May 3, 2008 draws attention to 
the need to ensure access to ICTs for people with disability on an 
equal basis with others and will help to eliminate barriers to 
information, including through the Internet. At the national level, laws
 and regulations can promote compliance with accessibility standards.The use of ICTs, such as the Internet, is rapidly becoming an 
essential part of the economic, educational and social life of many 
people today. Therefore it is vital that web sites can  be used by all, 
so that  people with disability have the same access to information 
as everyone else.Related linksWeb content accessibility guidelines"
What is sleeping sickness?,"Sleeping sickness, also called ""human African trypanosomiasis"",
 is a widespread tropical disease that can be fatal if not treated. It 
is spread by the bite of an infected tsetse fly (Glossina Genus),
 a species native to the African continent. More than sixty million 
people who live mainly in rural parts of East, West and Central Africa 
are at risk of contracting sleeping sickness.
		The tsetse fly bite erupts into a red sore and within a few 
weeks the person can experience fever, swollen lymph glands, aching 
muscles and joints, headaches and irritability. In advanced stages, the 
disease attacks the central nervous system and people present with 
changes in personality, alteration of the biological clock (the 
circadian rhythm), confusion, slurred speech, seizures and difficulty in
 walking and talking. These problems can develop over many years and if 
not treated, the person dies.   The main approaches to controlling African trypanosomiasis are
 to reduce the reservoirs of infection and the presence of the tsetse 
fly. Screening of people at risk helps identify patients at an early 
stage. Diagnosis should be made as early as possible and before the 
advanced stage to avoid complicated, difficult and risky treatment 
procedures."
What is dengue and how is it treated?,"Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by the bite of an
infected female Aedes mosquito. There are four distinct serotypes of the
dengue virus (DEN 1, DEN 2, DEN 3 and DEN 4). Symptoms appear in 3–14
days (average 4–7 days) after the infective bite. Dengue fever is a
flu-like illness that affects infants, young children and adults.
There is no specific treatment for dengue fever. Severe dengue
is a potentially lethal complication but early clinical diagnosis and
careful clinical management by experienced physicians and nurses often
save lives.
More than 70% of the disease burden is in South-East Asia and
the Western Pacific. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the incidence
and severity of disease have increased rapidly in recent years. The
African and Eastern Mediterranean regions have also recorded more
outbreaks of the disease in the last ten years. Since 2010 indigenous
transmission of dengue has also been reported in Europe. Urbanization,
rapid movement of people and goods, favorable climatic conditions and
lack of trained staff have all contributed to the global increase of
dengue."
What are the public health implications of global ageing?,"From 2000 until 2050, the world's population aged 60 and over 
will more than triple from 600 million to 2 billion. Most of this 
increase is occurring in less developed countries - where the number of 
older people will rise from 400 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion by 2050.
		This demographic change has several implications for public 
health. Good health is  key if older people are to remain independent 
and to play a part in family and community life. Life-long health 
promotion and disease prevention activities can prevent or delay the 
onset of noncommunicable and chronic diseases, such as heart disease, 
stroke and cancer. 

 But these diseases also need to be detected and treated early 
to minimize their consequences, and those who have an advanced disease 
will need decent long term care and support.  These services are best 
delivered through comprehensive primary care.Public health action can also draw on the capacities of older 
people. For example, the world's growing population of older people 
plays a critical role through volunteering, transmitting experience and 
knowledge, helping their families with caring responsibilities and 
increasing their participation in the paid labour force.Related linksOur ageing world"
What are the main differences between rich and poor countries with respect to causes of death?,"In high-income countries, 7 in every 10 deaths are among people
 aged 70 years and older. People predominantly die of chronic diseases: 
cardiovascular diseases, cancers, dementia, chronic obstructive lung 
disease or diabetes. Lower respiratory infections remain the only 
leading infectious cause of death. Only 1 in every 100 deaths is among 
children under 15 years.
		In middle-income countries, chronic diseases are the major 
killers, just as they are in high-income countries. Unlike in 
high-income countries, however, diarrhoeal diseases, road injury, 
HIV/AIDS and  prematurity also are leading causes of death. In low-income countries, nearly 4 in every 10 deaths are among
 children under 15 years, and only 2 in every 10 deaths are among people
 aged 70 years and older. People predominantly die of infectious 
diseases: lower respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS, diarrhoeal diseases, 
malaria and tuberculosis collectively account for almost one third of 
all deaths in these countries. Complications of childbirth due to 
prematurity, and birth asphyxia and birth trauma are among the leading 
causes of death among children under 5 years old, claiming the lives of 
many newborns and infants. Related linksSummary of World health statistics 2014"
How can violence against children be prevented?,"There are two distinct types of violence experienced by 
children (defined by the United Nations as anyone aged 0-18 years) - 
child maltreatment by parents and caregivers in children aged 0-14, and 
violence occurring in community settings among adolescents aged 15-18 
years. These different types of violence can be prevented by addressing 
the underlying causes and risk factors specific to each type.
		Child maltreatment by parents and caregivers can be prevented by:reducing unintended pregnancies;     reducing harmful levels of alcohol and illicit drug use during pregnancy;reducing harmful levels of alcohol and illicit drug use by new parents;improving access to high quality pre- and post-natal services; providing home visitation services by professional nurses and 
social workers to families where children are at high-risk of 
maltreatment;providing training for parents on child development, non-violent discipline and problem-solving skills.Violence involving children in community settings can be prevented through:pre-school enrichment programmes to give young children an educational head start; life skills training;assisting high-risk adolescents to complete schooling;reducing alcohol availability through the enactment and enforcement of liquor licensing laws, taxation and pricing;restricting access to firearms.Improving the efficiency of pre-hospital and emergency medical
 care will reduce  the risk of death, the time for recovery and the 
level of long-term impairment due to violence. All violence against children and especially child 
maltreatment occurring in the first decade of life is both a problem in 
itself and a major risk factor for other forms of violence and health 
problems through a person's life. For instance, a WHO study estimated 
that the lifetime impact of child sexual abuse accounts for 
approximately 6% of cases of depression, 6% of alcohol and drug 
abuse/dependence, 8% of suicide attempts, 10% of panic disorders and 27%
 of post traumatic stress disorders. Other studies have also linked 
child physical abuse, sexual abuse and other childhood adversities to 
excessive smoking, eating disorders, and high-risk sexual behaviour, 
which in turn are associated with some of the leading causes of death 
including cancers and cardiovascular disorders.WHO supports countries to collect data and information related
 to violence against children, develop national violence prevention 
policies and programmes, and create systems for the provision of 
appropriate medico-legal and emergency trauma care.Related linksChild maltreatment preventionTogether for girls: sexual violence against girlsUNICEF Child ProtectionSpecial Representatives of the United Nations Secretary General on Violence against Children"
What are neurological disorders and how many people are affected by them?,"Neurological disorders are diseases of the central and 
peripheral nervous system. In other words, the brain, spinal cord, 
cranial nerves, peripheral nerves, nerve roots, autonomic nervous 
system, neuromuscular junction, and muscles. These disorders include 
epilepsy, Alzheimer disease and other dementias, cerebrovascular 
diseases including stroke, migraine and other headache disorders, 
multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, neuroinfections, brain tumours,
 traumatic disorders of the nervous system due to head trauma, and 
neurological disorders as a result of malnutrition. 
		Many bacterial (i.e. Mycobacterial tuberculosis, Neisseria 
meningitides), viral (i.e. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), 
Enteroviruses, West Nile Virus, Zika), fungal (i.e. Cryptococcus, 
Aspergillus), and parasitic (i.e. malaria, Chagas) infections can affect
 the nervous system. Neurological symptoms may occur due to the 
infection itself, or due to an immune response.Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are affected by 
neurological disorders. More than 6 million people die because of stroke
 each year; over 80% of these deaths take place in low- and 
middle-income countries. More than 50 million people have epilepsy 
worldwide. It is estimated that there are globally 47.5 million people 
with dementia with 7.7 million new cases every year - Alzheimer's 
disease is the most common cause of dementia and may contribute to 
60–70% of cases. The prevalence of migraine is more than 10% worldwide."
Overview,"Vaccination is one of the best ways to prevent diseases. In total, vaccines are estimated to save between 2 and 3 million lives every year.Together with governments, vaccines manufacturers, scientists and medical experts, WHO's vaccine safety programme is constantly helping monitor the safety of vaccines.  This helps ensure that vaccines are safe for you and your family."
How do we know that a vaccine is safe?,"The most commonly used vaccines we have today have been in use for decades, with millions of people receiving them safely every year. In addition, there are several new vaccines under development. If approved, these will help prevent more life-threatening diseases – such as COVID-19, Zika or Nipah viruses - or improve the effectiveness of existing vaccines. As with all medicines, every vaccine needs to go through extensive and rigorous testing before it can be introduced in a country. Once they are in use, they must be continuously monitored to make sure they are safe for the people who receive them."
Are there side effects from vaccines?,"Vaccines are very safe. As with all medicines, side effects can occur after getting a vaccine. However, these are usually very minor and of short duration, such as a sore arm or a mild fever. More serious side effects are possible, but extremely rare. A person is far more likely to be seriously harmed by a disease than by a vaccine. Vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, meningitis or polio can be deadly, or cause severe illness and disability. Possible complications of these diseases can include: Blindness; Deafness; Paralysis; Brain damage; Infertility; Cancer; Birth defects; Death."
How are vaccines tested?,"Once a promising vaccine is identified, it will firstly undergo scrupulous laboratory testing. This includes careful examination and testing of the vaccine and its ingredients. These tests evaluate the safety of the vaccine, and how well it prevents a disease.If positive results are achieved in the lab, a manufacturer can then apply to do clinical trials. These trials typically involve several thousand healthy volunteers participants on a voluntary basis, whose safety is ensured by national regulatory authorities, and last for many years. The trials are bound by strict regulations and take place across three main phases:During Phase I, small groups (approximately 20-50 people) receive the vaccine. This phase will assess the safety, side effects, appropriate dosage, method of administration and composition of the vaccine.If it is successful, it will proceed to Phase II. At this stage, the vaccine is usually given to several hundred people. This group will have the same characteristics (e.g. age, sex) as the people for whom the vaccine is intended to be given.In Phase III, the vaccine is usually given to thousands of people to help ensure it is safe and effective for broader use.The results of all these studies will be assessed when regulators decide whether to approve a vaccine. Studies may also take place after a vaccine is introduced. They enable scientists to monitor efficacy and safety among an even larger number of people, over a longer timeframe."
Who approves a vaccine?,"In countries where vaccines are manufactured, national or regional regulators oversee a vaccine’s development. This includes approving clinical trials, evaluating their results, and taking decisions on licensing. In deciding, regulators must refer to very strict international standards on acceptable ethical clinical practice.Once a vaccine has been developed, national regulators decide whether to introduce a vaccine in their countries. WHO provides information to support this process, through comprehensive evaluation of the available evidence, and its regularly updated position papers on vaccines."
How is vaccine safety monitored?,"As with all medicines, the safety of a vaccine must be continuously monitored, even after trials and vaccine introduction. This monitoring considers reports from several sources. Nationally, these include the people who get vaccines, parents or caregivers, and health workers. These reports are then submitted to national health authorities.At a regional and global level, WHO and UNICEF support countries in collecting and monitoring this information, and ensuring countries have the most up to date evidence on available vaccines."
What happens if a problem is suspected with a vaccine?,"If a potential problem is reported following vaccination, a thorough investigation will take place. Investigations involve a thorough examination of the case in question, including medical assessment. If necessary, detailed studies are conducted.During these investigations, it is extremely rare that health problems are found to be caused by the vaccine itself. Health events are most often found to be coincidental, i.e. entirely unrelated to vaccination. Sometimes, they are related to how the vaccine has been stored, transported or administered (for instance, where errors are made in preparing the vaccine). Such errors can be prevented by training health workers, and strengthening vaccination programmes.In the rare cases where a genuine adverse reaction is suspected, the vaccine may be suspended from use. Further investigations will take place to determine what exactly caused the event, and corrective measures put in place."
How does WHO help ensure vaccine safety?,"WHO works to make sure that everyone, everywhere is protected by safe and effective vaccines. To do this, we help countries set up rigorous safety systems for vaccines – alongside other medicines - and work to develop the strictest standards for their regulation. Together with external scientists, WHO experts are continuously monitoring and updating the safety profile of more than 20 vaccines. With external partners, it also helps countries investigate and communicate if potential issues of concern arise.Events that are reported to WHO are evaluated by an independent group of experts (the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, or GACVS). On behalf of this committee, WHO issues regular statements on vaccine safety. For more information on how vaccines work, see our Q&A on vaccines."
What is vaccination?,"Vaccination is a simple, safe, and effective way of protecting people against harmful diseases, before they come into contact with them. It uses your body’s natural defenses to build resistance to specific infections and makes your immune system stronger. 
Vaccines train your immune system to create antibodies, just as it does when it’s exposed to a disease. However, because vaccines contain only killed or weakened forms of germs like viruses or bacteria, they do not cause the disease or put you at risk of its complications.
Most vaccines are given by an injection, but some are given orally (by mouth) or sprayed into the nose."
Why is vaccination important?,"Vaccination is a safe and effective way to prevent disease and save lives – now more than ever. Today there are vaccines available to protect against at least 20 diseases, such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza and measles. Together, these vaccines save the lives of up to 3 million people every year.When we get vaccinated, we aren’t just protecting ourselves, but also those around us. Some people, like those who are seriously ill, are advised not to get certain vaccines – so they depend on the rest of us to get vaccinated and help reduce the spread of disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination continues to be critically important. The pandemic has caused a decline in the number of children receiving routine immunizations, which could lead to an increase in illness and death from preventable diseases. WHO has  urged countries to ensure that essential immunization and health services continue, despite the challenges posed by COVID-19.More information about the importance of vaccines is available here."
How does a vaccine work?,"Vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body’s natural defenses to build protection. When you get a vaccine, your immune system responds. It:


Recognizes the invading germ, such as the virus or bacteria.


Produces antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced naturally by the immune system to fight disease. 


Remembers the disease and how to fight it. If you are then exposed to the germ in the future, your immune system can quickly destroy it before you become unwell.


The vaccine is therefore a safe and clever way to produce an immune response in the body, without causing illness.
Our immune systems are designed to remember. Once exposed to one or more doses of a vaccine, we typically remain protected against a disease for years, decades or even a lifetime. This is what makes vaccines so effective. Rather than treating a disease after it occurs, vaccines prevent us in the first instance from getting sick."
How do vaccines protect individuals and communities?,"Vaccines work by training and preparing the body’s natural defences – the immune system – to recognize and fight off viruses and bacteria. If the body is exposed to those disease-causing pathogens later, it will be ready to destroy them quickly – which prevents illness.When a person gets vaccinated against a disease, their risk of infection is also reduced – so they’re also far less likely to transmit the disease to others. As more people in a community get vaccinated, fewer people remain vulnerable, and there is less possibility for passing the pathogen on from person to person. Lowering the possibility for a pathogen to circulate in the community protects those who cannot be vaccinated due to other serious health conditions from the disease targeted by the vaccine. This is called “herd immunity.” “Herd immunity” exists when a high percentage of the population is vaccinated, making it difficult for infectious diseases to spread, because there are not many people who can be infected. But herd immunity only works if most people are vaccinated. At the same time, herd immunity does not protect against all vaccine-preventable diseases. For example, tetanus is caught from bacteria in the environment, not from other people, so those who are unimmunized are not protected from the disease even if most of the rest of the community is vaccinated."
Why should I get vaccinated?,"Without vaccines, we are at risk of serious illness and disability from diseases like measles, meningitis, pneumonia, tetanus and polio. Many of these diseases can be life-threatening. WHO estimates that vaccines save between 2 and 3 million lives every year.
Although some diseases may have become uncommon, the germs that cause them continue to circulate in some or all parts of the world. In today’s world, infectious diseases can easily cross borders, and infect anyone who is not protected
 Two key reasons to get vaccinated are to protect ourselves and to protect those around us. Because not everyone can be vaccinated – including very young babies, those who are seriously ill or have certain allergies – they depend on others being vaccinated to ensure they are also safe from vaccine-preventable diseases."
What diseases do vaccines prevent?,"Vaccines protect against many different diseases, including:

Cervical cancer
Cholera
Diphtheria
Hepatitis B
Influenza
Japanese encephalitis
Measles
Meningitis
Mumps
Pertussis
Pneumonia
Polio
Rabies
Rotavirus
Rubella
Tetanus
Typhoid
Varicella
Yellow fever


Some other vaccines are currently under development or being piloted, including those that protect against Ebola or malaria, but are not yet widely available globally.

Not all of these vaccinations may be needed in your country. Some may only be given prior to travel, in areas of risk, or to people in high-risk occupations. Talk to your healthcare worker to find out what vaccinations are needed for you and your family.


Should my daughter get vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV)?

Virtually all cervical cancer cases start with a sexually transmitted HPV infection. If given before exposure to the virus, vaccination offers the best protection against this disease. Following vaccination, reductions of up to 90% in HPV infections in teenage girls and young women have been demonstrated by studies conducted in Australia, Belgium, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.
In studies, the HPV vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective. WHO recommends that all girls aged 9–14 years receive 2 doses of the vaccine, alongside cervical cancer screening later in life."
When should I get vaccinated (or vaccinate my child)?,"Vaccines protect us throughout life and at different ages, from birth to childhood, as teenagers and into old age. In most countries you will be given a vaccination card that tells you what vaccines you or your child have had and when the next vaccines or booster doses are due. It is important to make sure that all these vaccines are up to date.
 If we delay vaccination, we are at risk of getting seriously sick. If we wait until we think we may be exposed to a serious illness – like during a disease outbreak – there may not be enough time for the vaccine to work and to receive all the recommended doses.

Why does vaccination start at such a young age?


Young children can be exposed to diseases in their daily life from many different places and people, and this can put them at serious risk. The WHO-recommended vaccination schedule is designed to protect infants and young children as early as possible. Infants and young children are often at the greatest risk from diseases because their immune systems are not yet fully developed, and their bodies are less able to fight off infection. It is therefore very important that children are vaccinated against diseases at the recommended time.

I didn't vaccinate my child at the recommended time. Is it too late to catch up?


For most vaccines, it’s never too late to catch up. Talk to your healthcare worker about how to get any missed vaccination doses for yourself or your child."
Who can get vaccinated?,"Nearly everyone can get vaccinated. However, because of some medical conditions, some people should not get certain vaccines, or should wait before getting them. These conditions can include:


Chronic illnesses or treatments (like chemotherapy) that affect the immune system; 


Severe and life-threatening allergies to vaccine ingredients, which are very rare;


If you have severe illness and a high fever on the day of vaccination.


These factors often vary for each vaccine. If you’re not sure if you or your child should get a particular vaccine, talk to your health worker. They can help you make an informed choice about vaccination for you or your child."
How are vaccines developed and tested?,"The most commonly used vaccines have been around for decades, with millions of people receiving them safely every year. As with all medicines, every vaccine must go through extensive and rigorous testing to ensure it is safe before it can be introduced in a country. An experimental vaccine is first tested in animals to evaluate its safety and potential to prevent disease. It is then tested in human clinical trials, in three phases:In phase I, the vaccine      is given to a small number of volunteers to assess its safety, confirm it      generates an immune response, and determine the right dosage. In phase II, the vaccine      is usually given hundreds of volunteers, who are closely monitored for any      side effects, to further assess its ability to generate an immune response.      In this phase, data are also collected whenever possible on disease      outcomes, but usually not in large enough numbers to have a clear picture      of the effect of the vaccine on disease. Participants in this phase have the      same characteristics (such as age and sex) as the people for whom the      vaccine is intended. In this phase, some volunteers receive the vaccine      and others do not, which allows comparisons to be made and conclusions      drawn about the vaccine. In phase III, the      vaccine is given to thousands of volunteers – some of whom receive the investigational      vaccine, and some of whom do not, just like in phase II trials. Data from      both groups is carefully compared to see if the vaccine is safe and      effective against the disease it is designed to protect against. Once the results of clinical trials are available, a series of steps is required, including reviews of efficacy, safety, and manufacturing for regulatory and public health policy approvals, before a vaccine may be introduced into a national immunization programme.Following the introduction of a vaccine, close monitoring continues to detect any unexpected adverse side effects and further assess effectiveness in the routine use setting among even larger numbers of people to continue assessing how best to use the vaccine for the greatest protective impact. More information about vaccine development and safety is available here."
I still have questions about vaccination. What should I do?,"If you have questions about vaccines be sure to talk to your healthcare worker. He or she can provide you with science-based advice about vaccination for you and your family, including the recommended vaccination schedule in your country.
When looking online for information about vaccines, be sure to consult only trustworthy sources. To help you find them, WHO has reviewed and ‘certified’ many websites across the world that provide only information based on reliable scientific evidence and independent reviews by leading technical experts. These websites are all members of the Vaccine Safety Net."
What is in a vaccine?,"All the ingredients of a vaccine play an important role in ensuring a vaccine is safe and effective. Some of these include:


The antigen. This is a killed or weakened form of a virus or bacteria, which trains our bodies to recognize and fight the disease if we encounter it in the future. 


Adjuvants, which help to boost our immune response. This means they help vaccines to work better.


Preservatives, which ensure a vaccine stays effective.


Stabilisers, which protect the vaccine during storage and transportation.


Vaccine ingredients can look unfamiliar when they are listed on a label. However, many of the components used in vaccines occur naturally in the body, in the environment, and in the foods we eat. All of the ingredients in vaccines – as well as the vaccines themselves - are thoroughly tested and monitored to ensure they are safe."
Are vaccines safe?,"Vaccination is safe and side effects from a vaccine are usually minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever. More serious side effects are possible, but extremely rare.
Any licensed vaccine is rigorously tested across multiple phases of trials before it is approved for use, and regularly reassessed once it is introduced. Scientists are also constantly monitoring information from several sources for any sign that a vaccine may cause health risks.
 Remember, you are far more likely to be seriously injured by a vaccine-preventable disease than by a vaccine. For example, tetanus can cause extreme pain, muscle spasms (lockjaw) and blood clots, measles can cause encephalitis (an infection of the brain) and blindness. Many vaccine-preventable diseases can even result in death. The benefits of vaccination greatly outweigh the risks, and many more illnesses and deaths would occur without vaccines.

Are there side effects from vaccines?


Like any medicine, vaccines can cause mild side effects, such as a low-grade fever, or pain or redness at the injection site. Mild reactions go away within a few days on their own. 
Severe or long-lasting side effects are extremely rare. Vaccines are continually monitored for safety, to detect rare adverse events.
 
Can a child be given more than one vaccine at a time?

Scientific evidence shows that giving several vaccines at the same time has no negative effect. Children are exposed to several hundred foreign substances that trigger an immune response every day. The simple act of eating food introduces new germs into the body, and numerous bacteria live in the mouth and nose. 
When a combined vaccination is possible (e.g. for diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus), this means fewer injections and reduces discomfort for the child. It also means that your child is getting the right vaccine at the right time, to avoid the risk of contracting a potentially deadly disease.
 
Is there a link between vaccines and autism?


There is no evidence of any link between vaccines and autism or autistic disorders. This has been demonstrated in many studies, conducted across very large populations.
The 1998 study which raised concerns about a possible link between measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism was later found to be seriously flawed and fraudulent. The paper was subsequently retracted by the journal that published it, and the doctor that published it lost his medical license. Unfortunately, its publication created fear that led to dropping immunization rates in some countries, and subsequent outbreaks of these diseases.
We must all ensure we are taking steps to share only credible, scientific information on vaccines, and the diseases they prevent."
How does WHO help ensure vaccine safety?,"WHO works to ensure that everyone, everywhere is protected by safe and effective vaccines. To do this, we help countries set up rigorous safety systems for vaccines and apply strict international standards to regulate them.Together with scientists from around the world, WHO experts conduct ongoing monitoring to make sure that vaccines continue to be safe. We also work with partners to help countries investigate and communicate if potential issues of concern arise.Any unexpected adverse side effects that are reported to WHO are evaluated by an independent group of experts called the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety."
What is thiomersal?,"Thiomersal is the most widely-used preservative for vaccines.
		Thiomersal is a compound containing ethyl mercury used to 
prevent bacterial and fungal growth in some inactivated vaccines in 
multi-dose vials. It is also used during production of specific vaccines, for 
example certain pertussis (whooping cough) vaccines, as part of the 
manufacturing process that makes the product safe and effective. 
Thiomersal has been  used  since the 1930s in the manufacture of some 
vaccines and other medicinal products."
Why do vaccines need preservatives?,"Preservatives inhibit growth of bacterial and fungal contaminants,
 which may be introduced during repeated use of a multi-dose vial. 
Multi-dose vials are used in many countries because they require less 
storage space in the cold-chain and lead to less wastage, both of which 
have a significant impact on programme costs. In many countries, for 
inactivated vaccines supplied in multi-dose vials, the presence of a 
preservative is a regulatory requirement."
Does the amount of thiomersal in vaccines pose a health risk ?,"WHO has closely monitored scientific evidence relating to the use 
of thiomersal as a vaccine preservative for over 10 years, in particular
 through its independent expert advisory group, the Global Advisory 
Committee on Vaccine Safety. The Committee has consistently reached the 
same conclusion: there is no evidence to suggest that the amount of 
thiomersal used in vaccines poses a health risk. Other expert groups 
(for example the U.S. Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of 
Pediatrics, the United Kingdom Committee on Safety of Medicine, and the 
European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products) have reached 
similar conclusions."
What would be the health impact of restricting thiomersal-containing vaccines ?,"Immunization with thiomersal-containing multi-dose vaccines 
currently protects at least 64% of all infants and children against four
 diseases with high mortality rates: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae
 type b. The use of thiomersal-containing vaccines to protect against 
these diseases averted  at least 1 400 000 child deaths in 2010. 
Thiomersal-containing vaccines are being used in over 120 countries. 
Removing thiomersal completely from vaccines would require either using 
alternative preservatives or using preservative-free single dose 
vaccines exclusively. Alternatives would incur significant costs for 
development and regulatory approval, thereby limiting the ability to 
offer affordable vaccines.
		Use of multi-dose vials is the most efficient and 
cost-effective way to protect populations when vaccines need to be 
administered to large numbers of people in a short space of time, such 
as in epidemic or pandemic situations."
Weren’t diseases already disappearing before vaccines were introduced because of better hygiene and sanitation?,"Ideas like this are very common in anti-vaccine literature, the intent apparently being to suggest that vaccines are not needed. Improved socioeconomic conditions have undoubtedly had an indirect impact on disease. Better nutrition, not to mention the development of antibiotics and other treatments, have increased survival rates among the sick; less crowded living conditions have reduced disease transmission; and lower birth rates have decreased the number of susceptible household contacts. However, looking at the actual incidence of disease over the years can leave little doubt of the significant direct impact vaccines have had, even in modern times.
For example, since sanitation is not better now than it was in 1990, it is hard to attribute the virtual disappearance of diseases such as Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) in children in recent years in countries with routine Hib vaccination (from an estimated 20 000 cases a year to 1419 cases in 1993, and dropping, in the United States of America) to anything other than the vaccine."
Which disease show the impact of vaccines the best?,"There are many examples, including smallpox, which was eradicated worldwide in 1979 following a collaborative global vaccination programme led by the World Health Organization. Smallpox killed hundreds of millions of people and was one of the most feared diseases for over 3000 years. Today is completely gone thanks to immunization efforts.
Another example is measles. There have been periodic peaks and valleys throughout the years, but the real, permanent drop in measles incidence coincided with the licensure and wide use of measles vaccine beginning in 1963. Other vaccine-preventable diseases show a roughly similar pattern in incidence, with all except hepatitis B showing a significant drop in cases corresponding with the advent of vaccine use."
What about hepatitis B? Does that mean the vaccine didn’t work?,"The incidence of hepatitis B has not dropped as much because infants vaccinated in routine programs will not be at high risk of disease until they are at least teenagers. Therefore, a 15-year lag can be expected between the start of routine infant vaccination and a significant drop in disease incidence. The Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine had a similar period of delay. Hib disease was prevalent until the early- to mid-1990s, when conjugate vaccines that can be used for infants were finally developed. The polysaccharide vaccine previously available could not be used for infants, in whom most cases of the disease were occurring."
What happens if countries don’t immunize against diseases?,"We can look at the experiences of several developed countries after they allowed their immunization levels to drop. Three countries – the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Sweden and Japan – cut back the use of pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine because of fear about the vaccine. The effect was dramatic and immediate. In the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a drop in pertussis vaccination in 1974 was followed by an epidemic of more than 100 000 cases of pertussis and 36 deaths by 1978. In Japan at around the same time, a drop in vaccination rates from 70% to 20–40% led to a jump in pertussis from 393 cases and no deaths in 1974 to 13 000 cases and 41 deaths in 1979. In Sweden, the annual incidence rate of pertussis per 100 000 children of 0–6 years of age increased from 700 cases in 1981 to 3200 in 1985.
There were also major epidemics of diphtheria that occurred in the former Soviet Union in the 1990s, where low primary immunization rates for children and the lack of booster vaccinations for adults resulted in an increase from 839 cases in 1989 to nearly 50 000 cases and 1700 deaths in 1994. There were at least 20 imported cases in Europe and two cases in U.S. citizens who had worked in the former Soviet Union. 
It seems clear from these experiences that not only would diseases not be disappearing without vaccines, but if we were to stop vaccinating, they would come back."
Can vaccines cause the disease? I’ve heard that the majority of people who get disease have been vaccinated.,"This is another argument frequently found in anti-vaccine literature, the implication being that this proves that vaccines are not effective. In fact it is true that in an outbreak those who have been vaccinated often outnumber those who have not — even with vaccines such as measles, which we know to be about 98% effective when used as recommended.
This apparent paradox is explained by two factors. First, no vaccine is 100% effective. To make vaccines safer than the disease, the bacteria or virus is killed or weakened (attenuated). For reasons related to the individual, not all vaccinated persons develop immunity. Most routine childhood vaccines are effective for 85% to 95% of recipients. Second, in most high-income countries, the people who have been vaccinated vastly outnumber those who have not.
How these two factors work together to result in outbreaks in which the majority of cases have been vaccinated can be more easily understood by looking at a hypothetical example:
Consider a high school of 1,000 students where none has ever had measles. All but 5 of the students have had 2 doses of measles vaccine, and so are fully immunized. The entire student body is exposed to measles, and every susceptible student becomes infected. The 5 unvaccinated students will be infected, of course. But of the 995 who have been vaccinated, we would expect several not to respond to the vaccine. The efficacy rate for 2 doses of measles vaccine can be as high as >99%. In this class, 7 students do not respond, and they, too, become infected. Therefore 7 of 12, or about 58%, of the cases occur in students who have been fully vaccinated.
As you can see, this doesn't prove the vaccine didn't work — only that most of the children in the class had been vaccinated, so those who were vaccinated and did not respond outnumbered those who had not been vaccinated. Looking at it another way, 100% of the children who had not been vaccinated got measles, compared with less than 1% of those who had been vaccinated. Measles vaccine protected most of the class; if nobody in the class had been vaccinated, there would probably have been 1,000 cases of measles."
Are there really so-called hot lots of vaccines that have been associated with more adverse events and deaths than others? Should parents prevent their children from receiving vaccines from these lots?,"This misconception often receives considerable publicity. First, the concept of a ""hot lot"" of vaccine as it is used in this context is wrong. It is based on the presumption that the more reports of adverse events a vaccine lot is associated with, the more dangerous the vaccine is in that lot. It also suggests that by consulting a list of the number of reports per lot, a parent can identify vaccine lots to avoid.
This is misleading for two reasons. First, an adverse report following vaccination does not mean that the vaccine caused the event. Statistically, a certain number of serious illnesses, even deaths, can be expected to occur by chance alone among children recently vaccinated. Although vaccines are known to cause minor, temporary side effects such as soreness or fever, there is little, if any, evidence linking vaccination with permanent health problems or death.
Second, vaccine lots are not the same. The sizes of vaccine lots might vary from several hundred thousand doses to several million, and some are in distribution much longer than others. Naturally, a larger lot or one that is in distribution for a longer period will be associated with more adverse events, simply by chance. Also, more coincidental deaths are associated with vaccines given in infancy than later in childhood, since the background death rates for children are highest during the first year of life. Knowing that lot A has been associated with x number of adverse events while lot B has been associated with y number would not necessarily say anything about the relative safety of the two lots. 
Reviewing published lists of ""hot lots"" will not help parents identify the best or worst vaccines for their children. If the number and type of adverse event reports for a particular vaccine lot suggested that it was associated with more serious adverse events or deaths than are expected by chance, most countries have a system to recall those vaccines. All vaccines purchased through the UNICEF vaccine procurement system meet World Health Organization standards for safety and quality of production."
How does safe water impact global health?,"Safe water supplies, hygienic sanitation and good water management are fundamental to global health. Almost one tenth of the global disease burden could be prevented by:

increasing access to safe drinking water;
improving sanitation and hygiene; and
improving water management to reduce risks of water-borne infectious diseases, and accidental drowning during recreation.

Annually, safer water could prevent:

1.4 million child deaths from diarrhoea;
500 000 deaths from malaria;
860 000 child deaths from malnutrition; and
280 000 deaths from drowning.

In addition, 5 million people can be protected from being seriously incapacitated from lymphatic filariasis and another 5 million from trachoma.
Recommended measures
Efforts to improve water, sanitation and hygiene interact with each other to boost overall health. Access to sanitation, such as simple latrines in communities, prevents drinking water contamination from human waste and reduces infections. High-tech public health measures are not necessarily the best: frequent hand-washing with soap and safe storage of drinking water are high-impact practices.
Environmental management effectively lowers the rates of malaria and other diseases spread by insects and prevents death. These measures include eliminating habitats - such as standing water - for breeding, and screening doors and windows for protection from mosquitoes.
Economic benefits
Investment to improve drinking water, sanitation, hygiene and water resource management systems makes strong economic sense: every dollar invested leads to up to eight dollars in benefits. US$ 84 billion a year could be regained from the yearly investment of US$ 11.3 billion needed to meet the water and sanitation targets under the Millennium Development Goals.
In addition to the value of saved human lives, other benefits include higher economic productivity, more education, and health-care savings."
When should a UTN be obtained?,"It is recommended that the UTN be obtained as soon as the 
first draft of the protocol has been compiled, although it can be 
obtained either sooner or later. For example:as soon as an investigator has an ideaas soon as the idea becomes a research proposalat the time the first draft of the protocol is compiledat the time the first meeting is held to discuss the protocolat the time the first meeting of potential investigators is heldA UTN may be obtained later in the trial's history (e.g. at 
the time of submission to the first ethics committee, or at the time of 
submission to a funding agency). It is likely to be more effective in 
unambiguously identifying a trial, though, if it is obtained early."
How can we obtain a UTN?,"Go to www.who.int/trialsearch/utn.aspx and follow the instructions.The process of obtaining a UTN involves 2 stages:applying for and obtaining a security codeapplying for and obtaining the UTNTo apply for the security code, the applicant will need to provide:the name of the individual submitting the request (Requestor)the email address of the individual submitting the requestthe Requestor's organizationAn email containing a secure hyperlink will then be sent to 
the email address entered. You should click on the hyperlink which will 
take you to the 'Get UTN' web site, where you should click on 'Get UTN'.
 The UTN will then be sent to you in an email."
"Will vaccines cause harmful side effects, illnesses or even death? Could there be long term effects we don’t know about yet?","Vaccines are very safe, despite implications to the contrary in many anti-vaccine publications. Most vaccine adverse events are minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever. These can often be controlled by taking paracetamol after vaccination. More serious adverse events occur rarely (on the order of one per thousands to one per millions of doses), and some are so rare that risk cannot be accurately assessed. So few deaths can plausibly be attributed to vaccines that it is hard to assess the risk statistically. Each death reported to ministries of health is thoroughly examined to assess whether it is really related to administration of vaccine, and if so, what exactly is the cause. When, after careful investigation, an event is felt to be a genuine vaccine-related event, it is most frequently found to be a programmatic error, not related to vaccine manufacture."
Is it true that there is a link between the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)?,"One myth that won't seem to go away is that the DTP vaccine causes sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). This belief came about because a moderate proportion of children who die of SIDS have recently been vaccinated with DTP; on the surface, this seems to point toward a causal connection. This logic is faulty, however; you might as well say that eating bread causes car crashes, since most drivers who crash their cars could probably be shown to have eaten bread within the past 24 hours.
If you consider that most SIDS deaths occur during the age range when three shots of DTP are given, you would expect DTP shots to precede a fair number of SIDS deaths simply by chance. In fact, when a number of well-controlled studies were conducted during the 1980s, the investigators found, nearly unanimously, that the number of SIDS deaths temporally associated with DTP vaccination was within the range expected to occur by chance. In other words, the SIDS deaths would have occurred even if no vaccinations had been given. 
In fact, in several of the studies, children who had recently received a DTP shot were less likely to get SIDS. The Institute of Medicine reported, ""all controlled studies that have compared immunized versus non-immunized children have found either no association . . . or a decreased risk . . . of SIDS among immunized children,"" and concluded, ""the evidence does not indicate a causal relation between [DTP] vaccine and SIDS."""
Isn’t even a small risk too much to justify vaccination?,"Looking at risk alone is not enough; you must always look at both risks and benefits. Even one serious adverse effect in a million doses of vaccine cannot be justified if there is no benefit from the vaccination. However, if there were no vaccines, there would be many more cases of disease, and along with them, more serious side effects and more deaths. For example, according to an analysis of the benefit and risk of DTP immunization, if there was no immunization program in the United States, pertussis cases could increase 71-fold and deaths due to pertussis could increase 4-fold. Comparing the risk from disease with the risk from the vaccines can give us an idea of the benefits we get from vaccinating our children.
The fact is that a child is far more likely to be seriously injured by one of these diseases than by any vaccine. While any serious injury or death caused by vaccines is too many, it is also clear that the benefits of vaccination greatly outweigh the slight risk, and that many, many more injuries and deaths would occur without vaccinations. In fact, to have a medical intervention as effective as vaccination in preventing disease and not use it would be unconscionable."
Vaccine-preventable diseases have been virtually eliminated from my country. Why should I still vaccinate my child?,"It is true that vaccination has enabled us to reduce most vaccine-preventable diseases to very low levels in many countries. However, some of them are still quite prevalent – even epidemic – in other parts of the world. Travellers can unknowingly bring these diseases into any country, and if the community were not protected by vaccinations, these diseases could quickly spread throughout the population, causing epidemics there.
At the same time, the relatively few cases that a country may currently have could very quickly become tens or hundreds of thousands of cases without the protection given by vaccines. We should therefore still be vaccinated. There are two main reasons. The first is to protect ourselves. Even if we think our chances of getting any of these diseases are small, the diseases still exist and can still infect anyone who is not protected.
The second is to protect those around us. There is a small number of people who cannot be vaccinated (because of severe allergies to vaccine components, for example), and a small percentage of people don't respond to vaccines. These people are susceptible to disease, and their only hope of protection is that people around them are immune and cannot pass disease on to them. A successful vaccination program, like a successful society, depends on the cooperation of every individual to ensure the good of all. We would think it irresponsible of a driver to ignore all traffic regulations on the presumption that other drivers will watch out for them. In the same way, we shouldn't rely on people around us to stop the spread of disease; we must all do what we can."
Is it true that giving a child multiple vaccinations for different diseases at the same time increases the risk of harmful side effects and can overload the immune system?,"Children are exposed to many foreign antigens every day. Eating food introduces new bacteria into the body, and numerous bacteria live in the mouth and nose, exposing the immune system to still more antigens. An upper respiratory viral infection exposes a child to 4–10 antigens, and a case of strep throat to 25–50. According to ""Adverse events Associated with childhood vaccines"", a 1994 report from the Institute of Medicine in the United States, ""In the face of these normal events, it seems unlikely that the number of separate antigens contained in childhood vaccines . . . would represent an appreciable added burden on the immune system that would be immuno-suppressive.""
Indeed, available scientific data show that simultaneous vaccination with multiple vaccines has no adverse effect on the normal childhood immune system. A number of studies and reviews have been conducted to examine the effects of giving various combinations of vaccines simultaneously. These studies have shown that the recommended vaccines are as effective in combination as they are individually, and that such combinations carry no greater risk for adverse side effects."
"Why are some vaccines grouped together, such as those for measles, mumps and rubella?","Research is under way to find ways to combine more antigens in a single vaccine injection, as with the measles, mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine. This method provides all the advantages of the individual vaccines but will require fewer injections. There are two practical factors in favour of merging vaccines and giving a child several vaccinations during the same visit. First, we want to immunize children as early as possible to give them protection during the vulnerable early months of their lives. This generally means giving inactivated vaccines beginning at 2 months and live vaccines at 12 months. The various vaccine doses thus tend to fall due at the same time. Second, combining several vaccinations will mean fewer clinic visits for vaccinations, which saves parents both time and money and may be less traumatic for the child. In countries where there is a likelihood of reduced contact with the health care system, there is an added advantage of ensuring that there are no missed opportunities to complete the recommended vaccinations for a child."
Who should obtain the UTN?,"The Sponsor, the Principal Investigator or other appropriate 
person (for example, the administrator of a collaborative trials group) 
should obtain a UTN for each trial."
How many UTNs should a trial have?,One only.
What should we do with the UTN?,"You should use it every time you need to identify the trial. The 
UTN should be submitted whenever the trial is registered. It may be 
entered into a field dedicated specifically to the UTN, or it may be 
entered into the secondary identifier field."
Is the UTN mandatory?,"No, the UTN is not currently mandatory, although some registries 
may choose to make providing the UTN mandatory in order to register a 
trial on their registry."
What should we do if a trial registry does not have a separate field for the UTN?,"If a trial registry does not have a specific field for the UTN, enter it in the secondary identifier field.No, the UTN is not currently mandatory, although some registries 
may choose to make providing the UTN mandatory in order to register a 
trial on their registry."
Q. What are the sources of the cause-of-death statistics?,"The cause-of-death statistics are from country civil registration systems. When a death occurs, this event is registered at the local civil registry with information on the cause of death. The information is then compiled by the national authority and submitted to WHO every year."
Q. Are the deaths medically-certified?,WHO only publishes here the medically-certified deaths. Diagnoses on causes of death by lay people are not included.
"Q. If the data coverage is not complete, have the data been adjusted for under-coverage?",The data presented are as submitted by the countries to WHO. No adjustment has been made to account for under-coverage. Information on the level of data coverage by country are available on same web site where you find this application.
Q. What kind of corrections have been made to the data?,"WHO verifies that the data submitted are coded with the official ICD codes. If non-official codes are used, they would be replaced with the most appropriate official codes."
Q. What are the sources of population data?,"Some countries submit regularly their population data. However for those who do not submit such data, the population estimates from the United Nations Population Division have been used."
Q. Which standard population have been used to calculate the age-standardized death rates?,"WHO has used the world standard population. See under ""Definitions"" in the main menu for further information on it."
Q. How are the number of deaths and population presented?,They are all shown as absolute numbers.
How will the UTN work?,"The UTN will be one of many identifiers that a trial may have,
 just as a driving license number may be one of many identifiers that an
 individual human has. Even though a single object has multiple 
identifiers, each one may play a role in helping to identify the object.
 When an individual applies for a passport, for example, they may be 
required to show 3 forms of identification (such as driving license 
number, a credit card number, a utilities bill number) to verify that an
 individual exists. Similarly, when a trial is registered, multiple 
identifiers may be able to help us to verify that a trial exists.The UTN will help us to unambiguously identify a trial by enabling us to link (or ""bridge"") multiple records on the same trial together on the ICTRP search portal."
What if my trial was registered before the UTN?,"We recognize that in some circumstances, a trial registered 
prior to the inception of the UTN may request retrospective assignment. 
 UTN numbers may be issued for previously registered trials.In order to avoid duplication of records and permit accurate 
record bridging on the ICTRP, it is strongly suggested that only the 
coordinating centre apply for the UTN. Once the UTN has been assigned, 
the coordinating centre should update all records within primary 
registers and on all other documentation (e.g., ethical review committee
 submissions, letters, etc) to reflect the UTN.Remember a trial, no matter how many sites should have only one UTN.Circumstances where retrospective UTN applications may be considered are:proposal, registered (not yet enrolling)trial registered and enrolment terminatedtrial registered, still enrolling, no new sitestrial registered, still enrolling, adding a new siteAs the primary purpose of the UTN is to identify a trial 
through stages of a clinical trial (including registration, approvals, 
trial recruitment, and participant follow up), the utility of a UTN 
following trial completion and/or publication is currently limited.  
While it is possible to apply for a UTN, it is again strongly suggested 
that this be a centralized process and that all documentation be linked 
to the UTN, retrospectively."
What is the M72/AS01E vaccine candidate?,"M72/AS01E is a subunit candidate vaccine comprised of an immunogenic fusion protein (M72) derived from two Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) antigens (MTB32A and MTB39A), and the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) proprietary adjuvant AS01E. AS01E is the same adjuvant used in Shingrix GSK vaccine, as well as in the new malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01E."
Who developed and who manufactured the vaccine?,"The M72/AS01E vaccine candidate was developed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, in partnership with AERAS. AERAS was a not for profit organization based in the US, aimed at supporting tuberculosis vaccine research, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), and other organizations. Current efforts are being coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute."
What was the role of WHO in this trial?,WHO was not involved in the design or implementation of this trial.
What is the Phase IIb trial on M72/AS01E designed to do?,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of M72/AS01E vaccine against pulmonary TB, as compared to placebo in HIV negative adults with latent TB infection living in high TB burden countries (South Africa, Kenya and Zambia) and aged 18 - 50 years. What is the trial design and the current statusThis was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial participating 3573 HIV negative adults (18-50 years old) in Southern Africa (2873 from South Africa, 162 from Zambia, 538 from Kenya) who had evidence of M.tb infection at baseline (IGRA+) vaccinated with M72/AS01E or placebo on a 2 dose schedule administered at 1 month interval. The primary endpoint was the development of pulmonary TB. This was a case driven analysis, where analysis was triggered by the accrual of a certain number of pulmonary TB cases (1,2). Can the vaccine cause unpleasant or dangerous reactions in people who have been vaccinated?Individuals vaccinated with M72/AS01E experienced more local and flu-like general reactions than placebo recipients. There were no other concerning imbalances in safety events between the study groups.Efficacy resultsThe results showed that administering two-doses of M72/AS01E was successful in reducing the development of active TB disease with 50% efficacy (90% CI, 12 to 71) in HIV negative adults with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. A total of 39 participants contributed to the primary vaccine efficacy analysis during 3 years of follow up: 13 participants vaccinated with M72/AS01E developed pulmonary TB, as compared to 26 participants in the placebo group."
How does the vaccine work?,"The exact mechanism of action of M72/AS01E is not known. Previous studies have showed that this vaccine induces an immune response characterized by the activation of interferon-gamma producing CD4+ T cells, and the production of antibodies. WHO strongly urges basic research to expand the current understanding of immune mechanisms of protection."
Does this vaccine provide long-term or life-long protection?,The study has demonstrated protection approximately during three years of study follow up. It is not currently known whether protection can extend for longer.
Is the efficacy reported adequate to have an impact on disease burden and spread?,"WHO has recently expressed a preference for a level of protection against tuberculosis in adults exceeding 50% efficacy. It will be important to determine whether the current vaccine also protects people who have not been infected with M.tb, across different geographical regions."
What values does HIA work with?,"HIA is based on four values that link the HIA to the policy environment in which it is being undertaken.Democracy – allowing people to participate in the development and implementation of policies, programmes or projects that may impact on their lives.Equity – HIA assesses the distribution of impacts from a proposal on the whole population, with a particular reference to how the proposal will affect vulnerable people (in terms of age, gender, ethnic background and socio-economic status).Sustainable development – that both short and long term impacts are considered, along with the obvious, and less obvious impacts.Ethical use of evidence – the best available quantitative and qualitative evidence must be identified and used in the assessment. A wide variety of evidence should be collected using the best possible methods."
What are the reasons to use HIA?,"Promotes cross-sectoral workingThe health and well-being of people is determined by a wide range of economic, social and environmental influences. Activities in many sectors beyond the health sector influence these determinants of health. HIA is a participatory approach that helps people from multiple sectors to work together. HIA participants consider the impacts of the proposed action on their individual sector, and other sectors – and the potential impact on health from any change. Overlaps with other policy and project initiatives are often identified, providing a more integrated approach to policy making. ""Joined up thinking"" and ""cross-sectoral working"" are phrases that apply to the HIA way of working.A participatory approach that values the views of the communityAn initial stage within the HIA process is to identify the relevant stakeholders. This process usually produces a large number of relevant people, groups and organizations. The HIA can be used as a framework to implicate stakeholders in a meaningful way, allowing their messages to be heard.Stakeholders commonly include:The local community/public, particularly vulnerable groupsDevelopersPlannersLocal/national governmentsVoluntary agencies, nongovernmental organizationsHealth workers at local, national or international levelsEmployers and unionsRepresentatives of other sectors affected by the proposalThe commissioner(s) of the HIAThe decision-makersThe network of people and organisations who will carry out the HIA.HIA provides a way to engage with members of the public affected by a particular proposal. An HIA can send a signal that an organization or partnership wants to involve a community and is willing to respond constructively to their concerns. Because the HIA process values many different types of evidence during the assessment of a proposal, the views of the public can be considered alongside expert opinion and scientific data, with each source of information being valued equally within the HIA. It is important to note that the decision makers may value certain types of evidence more than others, and community expectations must be managed to avoid ‘over-promising what an HIA can deliver. An HIA does not make decisions; it provides information in a clear and transparent way for decision makers’.The best available evidence is provided to decision-makersThe purpose of an HIA is to provide decision-makers with a set of evidence-based recommendations about the proposal. The decision-makers can then decide to accept, reject or amend the proposal, in the knowledge that they have the best available evidence before them. Evidence used in an HIA can be both qualitative and quantitative, and each is valuable. HIA should consider a range of different types of evidence – going beyond published reviews and research papers, to include the views and opinions of key players who are involved or affected by a proposal. Often, information of the quality and quantity demanded by decision-makers cannot be found, a note of this is made within the HIA and the best available evidence is provided.Improves health and reduces inequalitiesAddressing inequalities and improving health is a goal for many organisations and all governments. One way of contributing to the health and inequalities agenda is through the use of HIA. At the very least, HIA ensures that proposals do not inadvertently damage health or reinforce inequalities. HIA uses a wide model of health and works across sectors to provide a systematic approach for assessing how the proposal affects a population, with particular emphasis on the distribution of effects between different subgroups within the population. Recommendations can specifically target the improvement of health for vulnerable groups.It is a positive approachHIA looks not only for negative impacts (to prevent or reduce them), but also for impacts favourable to health. This provides decision-makers with options to strengthen and extend the positive features of a proposal, with a view to improving the health of the population.Appropriate for policies, programmes and projectsHIA is suitable for use at many different levels. HIA can be used on projects, programmes (groupings of projects) and policies, though it has most commonly been used on projects. The flexibility of HIA allows these projects, programmes and policies to be assessed at either a local, regional, national or international level – making HIA suitable for almost any proposal. However, choosing the right moment to carry out an HIA is important (see screening).TimelinessTo influence the decision-making process, HIA recommendations must reach the decision-makers well before any decisions about the proposal will be made. This basic principle of HIA highlights the practical nature of the approach. Experienced HIA practitioners can work within most timeframes, undertaking comprehensive (longer) or rapid (shorter) HIAs.Links with sustainable development and resource managementIf the HIA is undertaken at a sufficiently early stage in the project process, it can be used as a key tool for sustainable development. For example, an HIA on building a road would enable inclusion of health and other sustainability aspects - such as cycle lanes, noise and speed reduction interventions - to be included from the very beginning, rather than at a later date. This enables health objectives to be considered at the same level as socio-economic and environmental objectives, an important step towards sustainable development. Another feature of HIA is its possible combination with other impact assessment methods. This integration allows proposals to be assessed from a sustainable development perspective including: health, education, employment, business success, safety and security, culture, leisure and recreation, and the environment. Drawing on the wider determinants of health, and working across different sectors, HIA can play an important role in the sustainability agenda.Many people can use HIABecause it is a participatory approach, there are many potential users of HIA, including:Decision-makers who may use the information to select options more favourable to health;Commissioners of the HIA, who use it to consult widely and gather differing views, to build capacity and develop strong partnerships;HIA workers who carry out the individual components of the HIA, including consultants, local staff from a wide variety of organizations, and the community;Stakeholders, who want their views to be considered by decision-makers."
Q. How are the age-standardized death rates (ASDR) presented?,They are all shown as ASDR per 100 000 of the standard population.
Q. Why are some rates not presented although there are number of deaths?,"Rates are not calculated for countries with a population < 90,000 in 2017 as for small countries any slight variation in numbers would affect to a large extent the rates. Also when coverage is too low, no rates are presented to avoid misinterpretation."
Q. The list of countries does not seem to include all the countries in the world. What are the reasons?,"Simply because some countries do not report mortality data to WHO. However for some countries, the data they sent to WHO are not in standard ICD codes or do not have ICD codes, so they cannot be shown here. In many low-resourced countries, the cause-of-death information is difficult to obtain, mainly because the system for recording such information is not functioning or inexistent. In addition one of the big problems is the lack of medical certifiers to complete the death certificates."
Q. Are the data for the countries listed mutually exclusive?,"The data for the countries are mutually exclusive. For e.g. Martinique, Guadeloupe are not included in France."
Q. Why are some latest years of data missing?,"Countries usually submit data to WHO within 12-18 months after the closure of their records for the calendar year. Data checking, compilation and verification takes considerable time at the country level."
"Q. I would like to analyse causes of deaths other than those listed, how do I proceed?","On the same web site where you have found this application, there is link to download the raw detailed mortality files for each individual country by ICD code, year, age and sex. The data are available for years starting 1950 to date. You should have some experience in handling big databases (over million records) as the files cannot be imported into Excel. You should use a database management or statistical software such as MS Access, Stata, SAS, SPSS or R."
Can the vaccine prevent the development of drug-resistant TB?,"This has not been evaluated in the present study. However, a vaccine protective against pulmonary tuberculosis in adults, if used widely, has the potential to reduce drug resistant tuberculosis by reducing transmission and preventing the need for antibiotics; essential steps for curbing anti-microbial resistance. The role of this candidate vaccine in limiting the development and spread of drug-resistant forms of TB disease should be further evaluated."
What is WHO’s position on the results?,"WHO commends the efforts conducted in partnership between GSK, AERAS, study investigators, study participants, and countries in bringing this result forward. The results constitute an important scientific breakthrough, encouraging for the future role of new vaccines against TB.  WHO with independent experts and formally constituted advisory committees will be reviewing data from this program, and consider evidence for policy."
What will be the next steps?,"In 2020, the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute (Gates MRI) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Gates Foundation) announced that GSK has outlicensed M72/AS01E to the Gates MRI, paving the way for continued development and potential use of the vaccine candidate in countries with high TB burdens. WHO encourages the planning of accelerated progress towards a well-designed, Phase III program. Various priorities can be highlighted, including the need for a more precise estimation of vaccine efficacy, in different geographical settings, and further evaluation of safety. The effect of vaccination should also be characterized in people who do not have TB infection, in children, and in specific risk groups such as persons infected with HIV. This will require adequate vaccine production and financing. WHO calls on all relevant stakeholders including pharma, funders, governments, civil society, health care practitioners, policy makers and international agencies to work with a sense of urgency, in spirit of collaboration and a sense of responsibility towards public health, to bring forward the expedited validation of this product in the fight against tuberculosis."
Are there international policies and regulations for HIA?,"Several international policies and regulations make provisions for HIA or recommend its use, such as:Strategic Environmental AssessmentHealth effects are often poorly assessed within Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), or not at all. The establishment of a Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) Protocol – to supplement the UNECE Convention on EIA - has addressed this problem. In Kiev, in May 2003, governments of 35 European United Nations members signed the SEA protocol, whose provisions place special emphasis on human health, going beyond existing legislation. This reflects the political will of the governments, and the technical support of the health sector including WHO. The protocol also recommends that SEA be undertaken early enough in the decision-making process of proposals for environmental and health issues to be considered as part of a wider sustainability agenda. More information on this protocol.Article 152 of the Amsterdam TreatyThe Treaty calls for the European Union (EU) to examine the possible impact of major policies on health. The treaty states that ""A high level of health protection shall be ensured in connection with the formulation and implementation of all Community policies and all Community measures"". The European Commission's Health Strategy proposal states that policies must ensure that public health aspects be considered in all EU decisions and actions, therefore health impact assessments should be conducted.Environmental Impact AssessmentMany countries have statutory requirements for an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to be undertaken on every important project. The EU directive on EIA was introduced in 1985 and amended in 1997 and 2003. Country-specific links for environmental and strategic impact assessments can be found at the Impact Assessment Research Centre at the University of Manchester or the International Association for Impact Assessment. Unfortunately, an EIA does not typically include an assessment of the health effects, and when it does, it may be narrowly focused and only quantitative in nature.EU Strategic Environmental DirectiveThe European Commission began negotiations for a directive on the environmental assessment of plans and programmes in 1996. Several amendments to the proposal were made, leading to the SEA Directive being adopted by the European Council on 5 June 2001. The purpose of the SEA-Directive is to ensure that environmental consequences of certain plans and programmes are identified and assessed during their preparation and before their adoption. Member states were required to introduce the directive into their own legislation by 27 June 2004.Health21 – Health for allThe 51 countries comprising the WHO European Region have a common policy framework for health development, which outlines strategies to transform national policies into practical operational programmes at the local level. After consultations with Member States and several important organizations in the Region, four main strategies for action were chosen to ensure that scientific, economic, social and political sustainability drive the implementation of Health21. The first is that ""multisectoral strategies tackle the determinants of health, taking into account physical, economic, social, cultural and gender perspectives and ensuring the use of health impact assessment"".Environmental Health ConferencesThe 3rd ministerial conference on environmental health, held in London in 1999, recognized access to information, public participation and access to justice in environment and health as important issues. Several countries supported the idea of a protocol on strategic environment and health impact assessment, and the theme was submitted to the following environment and health conference in Budapest, in 2004.Libreville DeclarationIn 2008, the Libreville Declaration on Health and Environment in Africa encouraged governments to integrate health and the environment within public policies, poverty reduction strategies and national development plans. The implementation of health and environment intersectoral programmes at all levels is considered to be one of the decisive factors that may lead to the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals."
What does universal health coverage mean?,"Universal health coverage means that all people have access to the health services they need (prevention, promotion, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care) without the risk of financial hardship when paying for them.
This requires an efficient health system that provides the entire population with access to good quality services, health workers, medicines and technologies. It also requires a financing system to protect people from financial hardship and impoverishment from health care costs.
Access to health services ensures healthier people; while financial risk protection prevents people from being pushed into poverty. Therefore, universal health coverage is a critical component of sustainable development and poverty reduction, and a key element to reducing social inequities.
Universal health coverage is not something that can be achieved overnight, but all countries can take action to move more rapidly towards it, or to maintain the gains they have already made."
What is needed to achieve it?,"For a community or country to achieve universal health coverage, several factors must be in place including:


A strong, efficient, well-run health system that meets priority health needs through people-centred integrated care by:
    
informing and encouraging people to stay healthy and prevent illness;
detecting health conditions early;
having the capacity to treat disease; and
helping patients with rehabilitation
ensuring sensitive palliative care where needed.


Affordability – a system for financing health services so people do not suffer financial hardship when using them.
Availability of essential medicines and technologies to diagnose and treat medical problems.
A sufficient capacity of well-trained, motivated health workers to provide the services to meet patients’ needs based on the best available evidence.
Actions to address social determinants of health such as education, living conditions and household income which affect people’s health and their access to services."
What services should be included in universal health coverage?,"Essential health services (including for HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, non-communicable diseases and mental health, sexual and reproductive health and child health) should be available to all who need them.
The dilemma for most countries, in particular low-income countries, is that they are not able to provide everyone with all the health services they need at an affordable price, even with the large increases in external donor assistance for health since 2000.
The goal should be to provide an increasing number of health services over time while at the same time reducing out-of-pocket costs to patients. Decisions about the services that can be guaranteed to the population initially, and which ones should be added over time, are based on peoples’ needs, public opinion and costs.
The priority should be to ensure access to the key interventions targeting the health Millennium Development Goals – births attended by a trained health worker, family planning, vaccinations, and prevention and treatment of diseases such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis – while considering how to address the growing problem of noncommunicable diseases."
What is typhoid fever?,"Typhoid fever is a life-threatening infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi.It is usually spread through contaminated food or water.Symptoms include prolonged fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, 
abdominal pain, and constipation or diarrhoea. Some patients may have a 
rash. Severe cases may lead to serious complications or even death.Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics although 
increasing resistance to different types of antibiotics is making 
treatment more complicated.Even when the symptoms go away, people may still be carrying 
typhoid bacteria, meaning they can spread it to others through their 
faeces.An estimated 11–21 million people get sick from typhoid and between 128 000 and 161 000 people die from it every year. Communities lacking access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation, and vulnerable groups including children are at highest risk."
How can I protect myself from typhoid fever?,"Typhoid fever is common in places with poor sanitation and a lack of safe drinking water. Access to safe water and adequate sanitation, health education, appropriate hygiene among food handlers, and typhoid vaccination are all effective strategies for prevention and control of typhoid.Vaccines have been used for many years to prevent typhoid; currently available vaccines include:a newer injectable typhoid conjugate vaccine, consisting of the Vi antigen linked to tetanus toxoid protein, for children and adults from 6 months up to 45 years of agean injectable vaccine based on the purified antigen for people over 2 years of agea live attenuated oral vaccine in capsule formulation for people over 6 years of age.In December 2017, WHO prequalified the first typhoid conjugate vaccine. This newer vaccine has longer-lasting immunity than older vaccines, requires fewer doses, and can be given to children from the age of 6 months.This vaccine is currently being introduced into routine immunization in affected countries, with priority for countries with the highest burden of typhoid disease or high levels of antimicrobial resistance. With good levels of coverage, it is expected that this vaccine will help reduce the frequent use of antibiotics for typhoid treatment, which will slow the increase in antibiotic resistance in Salmonella Typhi."
How this can be financed?,"Universal health coverage is fundamental to ensuring social protection for health. The poorest populations often face the highest health risks and need more health services.
A key element of financing for universal health coverage is sharing resources to spread the financial risks of ill-health across the population.
The system should collect large pools of prepaid funds that can be used to cover the health care costs of those in need, regardless of their ability to pay.
The countries that have made the most progress on providing universal health coverage have implemented mandatory contributions for people who can afford to pay through taxation, and/or compulsory earmarked contributions for health insurance.
Reducing the reliance on direct, out-of-pocket payments lowers the financial barriers to access and reduces the impoverishing impact of health payments."
Are the most vulnerable people covered?,"In terms of financial protection, the most vulnerable people should have access to the health services they need without restrictions. In all countries, it has been found that governments have to use general budget revenues to meet the health costs (and/or insurance premiums) of poor and vulnerable people.
Ensuring access to health facilities, workers and medicines in remote, rural areas is also important, as is providing special interventions for stigmatized populations.
Universal coverage is firmly based on the WHO Constitution of 1948 declaring health a fundamental human right and on the Health for All agenda set by the Alma-Ata declaration in 1978. Equity is paramount. This means that countries need to track progress in providing access not just across the national population but within different groups (e.g. by income level, sex, age, place of residence, migrant status and ethnic origin)"
Isn't it too ambitious? Are countries succeeding in implementing?,"Countries at all income levels can take steps to move closer to universal health coverage.

Nepal, where free universal health care was introduced in 2008, is now on track to achieve its health-related MDGs.
In 2008, the Afghan Government, using considerable donor funding, removed user fees in public health facilities and healthcare utilization more than doubled.
Thailand has just celebrated ten years of its universal coverage scheme which has dramatically reduced impoverishment caused by out-of-pocket payments.
More recently, El Salvador has launched an ambitious plan to expand health coverage including abolishing user fees and strengthening primary health care in remote and poor rural areas.
Other countries moving forward in Africa include Liberia, Gabon, Ghana, Sierra Leone and Rwanda."
How can we measure universal health coverage?,"As universal health coverage is a combination of whether people obtain the health services they need and financial risk protection, measurement needs to include both components. Coverage of health services can be measured by the percentage of people receiving the services they need: for example women in fertile age groups accessing modern methods of family planning or children immunized. On the other hand, financial risk protection can be evaluated by a reduction in the number of families pushed into poverty or placed under severe economic strain due to health costs. The impact of these steps on population health and household financial wellbeing can also be measured, as can many of the factors that make it easier to increase coverage. These include the availability of essential medicines, for example.
The main challenge is that many countries do not have the capacity to measure coverage of all of the many health interventions that their populations needs. So they will need to choose a set of key indicators to track performance in service coverage. A sub-set of these could be used to compare performance between countries."
What is the impact of universal health coverage on the population?,"Universal health coverage has a direct impact on a population’s health and welfare. Access and use of health services enables people to be more productive and active contributors to their families and communities. It also ensures that children can go to school and learn. At the same time, financial risk protection prevents people from being pushed into poverty when they have to pay for health services out of their own pockets.
Universal health coverage is thus a critical component of sustainable development and poverty reduction, and a key element of any effort to reduce social inequities. Universal coverage is the hallmark of a government’s commitment to improve the wellbeing of all its citizens."
What is multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and how do we control it?,"The bacteria that cause tuberculosis (TB) can develop resistance to the antimicrobial drugs used to cure the disease. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is TB that does not respond to at least
isoniazid and rifampicin, the 2 most powerful anti-TB drugs.
The 2 reasons why multidrug resistance continues to emerge and
spread are mismanagement of TB treatment and person-to-person
transmission. Most people with TB are cured by a strictly followed,
6-month drug regimen that is provided to patients with support and
supervision. Inappropriate or incorrect use of antimicrobial drugs, or
use of ineffective formulations of drugs (such as use of single drugs,
poor quality medicines or bad storage conditions), and premature
treatment interruption can cause drug resistance, which can then be
transmitted, especially in crowded settings such as prisons and
hospitals. 
In some countries, it is becoming increasingly difficult to
treat MDR-TB. Treatment options are limited and expensive, recommended
medicines are not always available, and patients experience many adverse
effects from the drugs. In some cases even more severe drug-resistant
TB may develop. Extensively drug-resistant TB, XDR-TB, is a form of
multidrug-resistant TB with additional resistance to more anti-TB drugs
that therefore responds to even fewer available medicines. It has been
reported in 117 countries worldwide.
Drug resistance can be detected using special laboratory tests
which test the bacteria for sensitivity to the drugs or detect
resistance patterns. These tests can be molecular in type (such as Xpert
MTB/RIF) or else culture-based. Molecular techniques can provide
results within hours and have been successfully implemented even in low
resource settings.
New WHO recommendations aim to speed up detection and improve
treatment outcomes for MDR-TB through use of a novel rapid diagnostic
test and a shorter, cheaper treatment regimen. At less than US$ 1000 per
patient, the new treatment regimen can be completed in 9–12 months. Not
only is it less expensive than current regimens, but it is also
expected to improve outcomes and potentially decrease deaths due to
better adherence to treatment and reduced loss to follow-up.
Solutions to control drug-resistant TB are to:

cure the TB patient the first time around
provide access to diagnosis
ensure adequate infection control in facilities where patients are treated
ensure the appropriate use of recommended second-line drugs.

In 2016, an estimated 490 000 people worldwide developed
MDR-TB, and an additional 110 000 people with rifampicin-resistant TB
were also newly eligible for MDR-TB treatment. The countries with the
largest numbers
of MDR/RR-TB cases (47% of the global total) were China, India and the
Russian Federation. It is estimated that about 6.2% of these cases were
XDR-TB."
What is Public-Private Mix (PPM)?,"PPM is the involvement of all health care providers - public and private as well as formal and informal - in the provision of TB care, in line with International Standards for TB Care for patients who have or are suspected of having tuberculosis."
When is PPM needed?,"PPM is needed when:there is high utilization of the private sector and non-NTP public sector such as medical colleges, army, etc.quality of care is poor in these facilitieslow case detectionpoor treatment outcomesdelay and high costs for patients."
"How does PPM enhance the quality of diagnosis, treatment, decentralize and make treatment conveniently accessible for patients?",PPM reduces malpractice by fostering evidence-based TB diagnosis and treatment in line with the International Standards for TB Care. This improves cure rates and reduces risks of drug resistance development. It also limits misdiagnosis of TB and unnecessary and often costly treatments.
How does PPM increase case detection and reduce diagnostic delays?,"PPM helps increase TB case detection and reduces diagnostic delays by involving all health care providers in timely referral ,diagnosis , ensures proper notification of all diagnosed cases and enrollment on appropriate treatment under programme guidelines. The engagement of private providers entails adequate training of these providers to ensure that the quality of their services is aligned with the International Standards for TB care. In addition evidence shows that private providers are often the first point of contact for health services. These providers (with adequate training) could play an important role in case detection and referral of patients to the public sector cutting down significantly on diagnostic delays."
Does PPM afford improved and equitable access to TB care to all patients?,"PPM improves access to treatment by involving health care providers from whom the poor, marginalized and most vulnerable seek care. Often public health facilities are situated at a distance from the home or workplace of the patient, therefore access to these services involves transportation costs and loss of wages which are barriers in access to health care for disadvantaged populations. The involvement of all providers in PPM enhances access of closer-to-home health services for both men and women.In addition PPM ensures that proper notification and enrollment for appropriate treatment under programme guidelines of all diagnosed patients is carried out."
How does PPM provide for reduced cost of care and financial protection for the poor?,PPM reduces costs to patients by ensuring that treatment for TB is free of charge and all other costs are kept to a minimum. PPM can also reduce indirect costs for patients by providing services closer to their homes or workplace.
Does PPM ensure better access to health care services for women as compared to other health services?,"Women in many developing countries often have less power to make decisions on healthcare utilization. Additionally, public health facilities are not always easily accessible from their places of residence. The cost of transportation and the loss of income for both the patient and the guardian or escort are major inhibitors for women in access to public health care. Therefore in many cases they first approach the private sector for health services. PPM can ensure that women have access to good quality health care services close to their home."
Does PPM ensure gathering of essential epidemiological data?,PPM contributes towards completeness of epidemiological surveillance on TB when all care providers who diagnose and treat TB follow proper TB recording and reporting routines linked to national information systems.
What roles can private health care providers play in TB Control?,"All health care providers both private and public can play one or more important roles in TB control including: helping identify people with TB; prescribing treatment; acting as treatment supervisors; tracing treatment defaulters; providing information and spreading awareness, training and supervision of health care staff; and management of drug supplies and equipment."

Why are there changes to the WHO Consolidated Guidelines on DR-TB treatment issued in 2018?,"New evidence on the effectiveness and safety of all-oral shorter regimens for MDR/RR-TB treatment was made available
to WHO during 2019, specifically from the Nix-TB study and from observational studies and programmatic data. These
data addressed some of the evidence gaps identified in 2018 and were felt to have direct public health benefit. It is
expected that ongoing studies on treatment of MDR/RR-TB will be completed in the coming few years and data will be
regularly reviewed by WHO as part of our mandate for global policy development to improve therapeutic options for
patients."
Why was the Rapid Communication released by WHO?,"The Rapid Communication was released by WHO in advance of the detailed updated policy guidelines to alert national TB
programmes and other stakeholders early-on to key changes for MDR/RR-TB treatment based on the latest evidence; to
facilitate policy uptake and planning at country level; and to facilitate budget and procurement planning by countries and
their stakeholders, especially in light of countries application to the Global Fund by mid-2020."
What are the main changes signalled by the Rapid Communication?,"The most important changes signalled by the Rapid Communication are the following:Injectable medicines should be phased out as a matter of priority in all treatment regimens and replaced by
bedaquiline. A shorter all-oral bedaquiline-containing treatment regimen of 9-12 months duration is the
preferred option for eligible MDR/RR-TB patients (see regimen presented on page 2);Individualized all-oral longer regimens, designed using the WHO priority grouping of medicines (Table
2.1), may be still used for MDR/RR-TB patients who do not meet the eligibility criteria for an all-oral
shorter bedaquiline-containing regimen;The BPaL treatment regimen may be used under operational research conditions in eligible XDR-TB
patients;More emphasis is placed on the need for drug susceptibility testing, active TB drug safety monitoring and
management (aDSM), support to patients and close monitoring of treatment response, and rigorous data
collection;"
What are the dosages of the medicines in the shorter all-oral bedaquiline-containing MDR/RR-TB regimen recommended by WHO?,"In the evidence provided by South Africa that supported the decision by the GDG, treatment regimen contained
bedaquiline for 6 months, plus levofloxacin, ethionamide, ethambutol, isoniazid (high-dose), pyrazinamide, and
clofazimine for 4 months (with the possibility to extend to 6 months if the patient remains sputum smear-positive at the
end of four months); followed by 5 months of treatment with levofloxacin, ethambutol, clofazimine and pyrazinamide.
Smaller proportion of patients received moxifloxacin instead of levofloxacin.The recommended dosages for levofloxacin, ethionamide, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, isoniazid (high-dose) and
clofazimine by weight were published in the WHO Consolidated Guidelines on Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment in
2019 and remain valid. The use of bedaquiline for the evidence assessed was limited to 6 months with the dosage
recommended by the manufacturer (400mg daily for the first 2 weeks followed by 200 mg three times weekly for 22
weeks).Medicines are taken once a day, all days of the week (except where otherwise specified)"
Which MDR/RR-TB patients are eligible to be treated with the shorter all-oral bedaquiline containing regimen?,"All MDR/RR-TB patients in whom resistance to fluoroquinolones was ruled out and without:Confirmed resistance to or suspected ineffectiveness of a medicine in the shorter MDR-TB regimen (except
isoniazid resistance)Exposure to one or more second-line medicines in the shorter MDR-TB regimen for >1 month (unless
susceptibility to these second-line medicines is confirmed)Intolerance to medicines in the shorter MDR-TB regimen or risk of toxicity (e.g. drug-drug interactions)PregnancyDisseminated, meningeal or TB of the central nervous system."
Can a shorter all-oral bedaquiline containing MDR-TB regimen be used in HIV-co-infected patients?,Yes. The data from South Africa used for the analysis included a high proportion of HIV co-infected patients (71%).
Can changes be made to the duration and composition of the shorter all-oral bedaquiline containing regimen?,"No. The shorter all-oral bedaquiline containing regimen was implemented as a standardized package under
programmatic conditions in South Africa. The current WHO recommendation is based on these data. Therefore, it is not
advised to further shorten the duration of the regimen. Likewise, changes to the regimen composition may have an
unpredictable impact on its effectiveness and are therefore not currently recommended to be implemented
programmatically. Medicines in the same class could, nevertheless be switched as follows:Prothionamide used instead of ethionamide;Moxifloxacin used instead of levofloxacin; andThe initial phase extended until 6 months if required; the duration of the continuation phase is fixed at 5
months.National TB programmes that intend to make any further modifications to the shorter all-oral bedaquiline-containing
regimen are advised to do so under operational research conditions."
Can the shorter all-oral bedaquiline containing regimen be used in children? What dosages should be used?,"Yes, in children older than six years, as no evidence is available for the use of bedaquiline in children under 6 years of age.
Pediatric dosing of second-line medicines as outlined in the 2019 WHO Consolidated Guidelines remain valid. Quality assured pediatric formulations of levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, clofazimine, cycloserine, ethionamide, ethambutol, and
pyrazinamide are available through the Stop TB Partnership’s (STBP) Global Drug Facility (GDF) while a pediatric
formulation of linezolid is under development."
Can bedaquiline be used in pregnant women?,"Yes. The use of bedaquiline as a part of an all-oral longer MDR-TB regimen was shown to be generally safe in pregnant
women in a study in South Africa. In this study exposure to bedaquiline (most frequently used together with clofazimine
and levofloxacin), was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight (<2500g), although normal growth was
achieved in these babies."
Can all MDR-TB patients be treated with the BPaL regimen?,"No. The BPaL regimen is relevant in patients with confirmed XDR-TB who have not had previous exposure to bedaquiline
and linezolid for more than two weeks. This regimen is not appropriate for programmatic use worldwide until additional
evidence on efficacy and safety has been generated. Nevertheless, in individual XDR-TB patients for whom the design of an
effective regimen based on existing WHO recommendations is not possible, the BPaL regimen may be considered as a last
resort under prevailing ethical standards."
Can pretomanid be added to other TB treatment regimens?,"No. In August 2019, pretomanid (Pa) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as part of the BPaL regimen,
that is in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid. The data from Nix-TB study provided for the review by the GDG in
November 2019 also included the data on BPaL regimen and use of pretomanid in combination with two other medicines.
There is no currently available evidence on the use of Pa outside the BPaL regimen and it is therefore not included in the
priority grouping of TB medicines recommended by WHO. Although it is a nitroimidazole (i.e. in a similar class as delamanid)
it is a new chemical compound and cannot be used as a replacement for delamanid or added on its own to first- and
second-line treatment regimens."
What are national TB programmes expected to do in response to the changes?,"While understanding that it may not be immediately possible to achieve the new standards of care rapidly in every patient,
strategic planning, focused on issues such as drug forecasting and procurement should start immediately to enable rapid
transition to the upcoming new WHO recommendations. Phasing out injectables and replacing them with bedaquiline is
an urgent priority. National TB programmes will need to establish transition plans in agreement with relevant partners,
stakeholders and donors. Updated national policies, decision-making aids and/ or training materials on the new MDR-TB
treatment regimens should be done as soon as the detailed WHO guidelines are released (expected in April, 2020)."
What are the key steps that national TB programmes should take when planning transition to updated recommendations?,"In general, national TB programmes and their stakeholders need to determine how to implement the new
recommendations in their specific settings, including the choice of regimens based on current laboratory capacity for drug
susceptibility testing and background drug resistance patterns. Countries should also plan for the following:Inclusion of any products not previously used in the national Essential Medicines List;Ensuring that new products can be procured and imported (e.g. registration, import waivers);Identifying any funding gaps between the old and new guidelines and securing the necessary additional funds;Planning procurement of products with adequate lead times for procurement processes and for the products to
be produced, delivered and available at the point of use (e.g. 4 to 6-month lead time after order finalization and
payment);
• Planning for the disposal of drugs no longer required;Strengthening laboratory capacity to undertake DST for the essential drugs as well as for aDSM;Updating national treatment policies/ guidelines;Healthcare worker training."
How do I register patients and which definitions do I use to assign treatment outcomes now?,"The MDR/RR-TB patient registration and treatment outcome definitions published by WHO in 2013 continue to apply. The definitions are planned to be reviewed
and updated by WHO in 2020."
Will WHO change the definition of XDR-TB? What is the significance of “pre-XDR”?,"The current definition of XDR-TB - MDR-TB with additional resistance to a fluoroquinolone and an injectable agent (amikacin,
kanamycin or capreomycin) - is likely to require changes given the phasing out of injectables, anticipating patterns of
resistance that are more relevant to current and future regimens, and taking into account advances in diagnostic methods and drug susceptibility testing. Changes to the definition of XDR-TB will be the subject of future expert consultation and will
be included in revised WHO surveillance and reporting guides.Choosing appropriate regimens for patients with strains showing MDR-TB plus additional resistance to fluoroquinolones (so called “pre-XDR”) are increasingly becoming more important and feasible thanks to rapid advances in molecular drugsusceptibility testing (see 2.5)."
How can resistance to the medicines in MDR-TB regimens be determined?,"The updated WHO guidelines will stress the importance of drug susceptibility testing (DST) prior to treatment, especially for
the medicines for which WHO-recommended rapid molecular tests are available. These include rifampicin, isoniazid and
quinolones. In addition, NTPs need to scale-up laboratory capacity for medicines for which there are accurate and
reproducible phenotypic methods, including bedaquiline, linezolid, clofazimine and delamanid.The WHO Supranational TB Reference Laboratories (SRL) Network is available to support national TB reference
laboratories in performing quality-assured DST. A WHO technical consultation in 2017 established critical concentrations
for susceptibility testing for the fluoroquinolones, bedaquiline, delamanid, clofazimine and linezolid. Methods for testing
pretomanid susceptibility are currently under development.As in any potentially life-saving situation, treatment for drug-resistant TB should not be withheld from a patient due to a
lack of complete DST results. Even if available in some laboratories, phenotypic DST for cycloserine/terizidone,
ethambutol, imipenem-cilastatin/meropenem, ethionamide/prothionamide, and p-aminosalicylic acid is not
recommended for clinical decision making. Molecular DST methods such as sequencing are increasingly becoming
available at the national TB reference laboratory level and sequencing results can inform the development of
individualized regimens. Susceptibility to some of the medicines may in part be inferred from the results of molecular
testing using commercially available line probe assays (LPA)"
Should DST be done before bedaquiline and linezolid are used?,"The availability of DST for these medicines is currently limited in many settings and the resistance levels are likely to be
very low at this point. Performing DST to bedaquiline and linezolid is therefore not essential before using these
medicines at this stage; however, national TB programmes are strongly advised to start building capacity for drug
resistance surveillance of these medicines. If resistance is suspected during treatment and DST is not available, the strains
should be conserved and referred to SRLs for further testing."
What changes are expected to the monitoring of drug adverse events?,"The updated WHO guidelines will stress the importance of appropriate capacity for aDSM for all patients on MDR-TB
treatment. In addition to bacteriological investigations, several monitoring tests including electrocardiography (ECG),
clinical assessments for peripheral neuropathy and psychiatric disturbances, laboratory assessment of liver and kidney
function and blood profiles are necessary, based on the medications in use. Medicines with known risks for QT-interval
prolongation require ECG and monitoring of electrolytes, both at baseline and regularly during treatment. Details on
monitoring and managing the safety of individual drugs are described in the WHO Companion Handbook, which will be available in a 2020 edition."
How should patient support be provided when taking MDR TB medication?,"Close monitoring, supervision and treatment support of patients as part of a person-centered approach are needed to
maximize treatment adherence and enable early detection of patients who are not responding to treatment. Evidenceinformed recommendations about patient support are provided in the 2019 Consolidated Guidelines and will be included
in the 2020 update also.Health education and counselling on the disease and treatment adherence is strongly recommended to patients on TB
treatment. Community- or home-based DOT is conditionally recommended over health facility-based DOT or unsupervised
treatment. DOT administered by trained lay providers or health-care workers is conditionally recommended over DOT
administered by family members or unsupervised treatment. Moreover, video (virtual) observed treatment (VOT) can
replace DOT when the technology is available and can be appropriately organized and operated by health-care providers
and patients.Health education and counselling on the disease and treatment adherence is strongly recommended to patients on TB

"Can GF support countries during transition to all-oral regimens including BPaL and phase-out of injectable agents including improving capacity for DST and aDSM, procuring drugs, dealing with stock outs, excess stocks and destruction of injectable agents?","The Global Fund (GF) encourages countries to accelerate implementation and scale up the new regimens for MDR/RR and XDRTB. The Global Fund secretariat will continue working closely with WHO, STBP/GDF and other partners to support
countries during transition to new and better treatment regimens. Global Fund will continue engaging in resource
mobilization activities to address gaps. The Global Fund teams are working closely with STBP/GDF and NTPs on the
current stocks, preliminary quantifications and assessment of the cost implications of transitioning to new regimens
including destruction of agents that are no more recommended. Contact your Global Fund country team for more
information when considering destruction of agents that are no more recommended."
What support is available to countries without Global Fund funding during the phase-in and phase-out period?,"WHO, StopTB/GDF and other partners are available to support countries during the transition to new and better treatment
regimens. STBP/GDF can provide support to develop phase-in and phase-out plans for programmes, assist in quantifying
and forecasting for new regimens and help programmes to determine the number and cost of injectable agents that would
need to be destroyed or re-allocated to other parts of the healthcare system (for example Amikacin can be used for
treatment of several bacterial infections). When programmes decide to destroy a product, it should be done in alignment
with current recommendations and national guidelines."
We have excessive stock of amikacin. What shall we do with it?,"Countries are encouraged to phase out injectable containing regimens and replace injectables with bedaquiline.
Amikacin could be used for the treatment of several bacterial infections and therefore can be allocated to the to other
parts of the healthcare system."
"If the conditions in the country do not allow programmes to transition to bedaquiline-based shorter regimens immediately, what are the alternatives?","The Global Fund country teams were advised not to process new orders for kanamycin, capreomycin in 2018. This
advice will be extended to exclude amikacin from new orders for use in shorter regimen for DR-TB as per the 2019 Rapid
Communication. In line with the WHO Rapid Communication 2019, in principle, countries should not place new orders of amikacin for use
in the shorter regimen. However, this should be done in a way so as not to interrupt patient treatment or cause a stockout. If a country faces this situation, you should contact your country Global Fund country team and STBP/GDF to review
available options"
"Should we stop all orders of kanamycin, capreomycin and amikacin (for use in the shorter regimen)?","NTPs need to transition swiftly to replace kanamycin, capreomycin and amikacin with bedaquiline for patients receiving
the shorter MDR-TB regimen. This transition needs to be implemented in coordination with the procurement specialists
and clinicians to ensure no patient receives suboptimal regimen that may lead to amplified drug resistance or exposure to
other unnecessary risks."
A programme has placed an order with STBP/GDF based on previous recommendations – can that order be cancelled or modified?,"Each order will need to be reviewed individually and in the context of the order status, the country programmatic needs
(e.g., risk of stock outs and treatment interruptions) and other medicines included in the order. In general, for orders
that have been confirmed (i.e., price quote approved by the programme and payment transferred) but are not ready for
shipment, programmes should contact STBP/GDF who will work to find a solution on a case-by-case basis. Orders that
have been confirmed and the programme has authorized packing generally cannot be modified or cancelled."
"How many MDR-TB, XDR-TB cases should I plan to treat? Is it realistic to use old estimates for future enrolments with new regimens?","Programmes should aim to align their national strategic plans to expand case detection and treatment targets in line with
the updated Global Plan to Stop TB and the targets set out in the United Nations High-Level Meeting on Tuberculosis.
Changes to the programme planning will need to be made according to the specific programme context and
epidemiology, and based on considerations such as programme procurement capacity, demand for laboratory analyses,
resource availability and mobilization."
How should programmes begin to take this Rapid Communication into account when quantifying and forecastingtheir procurement needs?,"Programmes need to collect the usual information required to quantify and forecast procurement needs, including the
number of people currently on treatment, the latest data on consumption of medicines and current available stocks of
medicines. Programmes will need to know the number of people that are expected to be enrolled and make assumptions
on which treatment regimens will be used and the allocation between the different regimens. These assumptions should:Estimate the number of people that would qualify for a bedaquiline-based shorter regimen, the preferred initial
regimen for MDR/RR-TB. These estimates need to account for the current eligibility criteria for use of the shorter
regimen.The remaining number of people that would not qualify for the bedaquiline-based shorter-regimen and should
receive an individualized longer regimen based on the criteria set out in the most recent WHO Guidance on DRTB.If a programme is planning to introduce the BPaL regimen for the treatment of XDR under operational research
conditions, this should be estimated as well.Planning should be done by medicine for those receiving individualized regimens (and those that may move to an individualized regimen after starting the bedaquiline-based shorter regimen). When planning the composition of such
regimens NTPs need to consider patient history, DST profiles of the patient, local setting (the prevalence of different
resistance patterns) and the benefits/harms of different possible components of the regimens. For the quantification
and forecast of appropriate volumes of consumables please see below.
Any estimates need to be reviewed regularly and adjusted based on actual adoption of the different regimens
recommended."
What are the lead times for ordering new medicines?,"The lead time for most products from STBP/GDF are between 4 to 6 months. This is calculated once the order is finalized
and payment has been made. This lead time does not include the time taken to finalize an order and to receive all
programme, country and donor approvals, which may add 1-2 months or more depending on factors such as delays to
clear Customs and complete administrative procedures. For more information on planning for an order with STBP/GDF,
please see the “Category and Product-Level Procurement and Delivery Planning Guide”."
"Can STBP/GDF procure all the medications, laboratory equipment and consumables needed to expand treatment services as per the new guidelines?","Yes! All of the medications, laboratory equipment and consumables to implement the new guidelines are available from
STBP/GDF. Please see the GDF Product Catalogue for more details. Eligible programmes procuring laboratory equipment
and consumables for LPA and liquid culture from STBP/GDF may benefit from preferential concessional prices.STBP/GDF is ready to provide pure substances of all of the medicines for which DST is currently recommended, including
linezolid and clofazimine. Pure drug substances for bedaquiline and delamanid are available from manufacturers under
the following mechanisms:Bedaquiline: Bedaquiline pure drug substance is provided for free through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program
(https://www.aidsreagent.org). Delivery is also free when one indicates “JNJ” as the “Shipping Co. Account No.”
during registration. Note that ordering bedaquiline is a two-step process: First one needs to register to become
eligible to receive reagents from the NIH catalog, and then second, one needs to place an order for bedaquiline
in particular.Delamanid: Delamanid pure drug substance is provided for free through the ATCC BEI Program. Delamanid is item number NR-51636.STBP/GDF has initiated discussions with the manufacturer of pretomanid to include this pure drug substance in its
catalogue once it becomes available."
Are there any anticipated supply limitations through STBP/GDF? Is there a risk that any of my new orders for these drugs will be delayed or cannot be fulfilled?,"No! STBP/GDF is working closely with the all suppliers and they have confirmed they are ready for increased
demand. GDF will monitor the supply situation closely."
Is there any mechanism to signal the likely demand to suppliers based on preliminary estimates so that the suppliers can start preparing for the anticipated higher volumes of orders in order to minimize the lead time once final orders are placed?,"STBP/GDF will be updating its demand forecast and will communicate it as part of its next regular international tender,
which will account for demand changes as observed in revised quantifications from its client countries. This updated
forecast and information on products that require additional qualified suppliers will be communicated to manufacturers
during STBP/GDF regular TB medicines manufacturers meeting."
"With the anticipated increase in demand for bedaquiline and the likely submission of orders by countries after release of guidelines, can the standard lead time of 4-6 months after order finalization & payment still be applicable?","Yes. GDF does not anticipate any change in the standard delivery lead-time of 4-6 months from the time of order
confirmation and receipt of payment from clients to time of in-country delivery."
Will GDF continue to provide pure drug substances for DST for medicines no longer recommended?,"Yes. GDF will continue to provide pure drug substances for DST of medicines that are no longer recommended until GDF
client countries no longer require them or until they are no longer commercially available."
"Is technical assistance available for planning, preliminary quantification, drug registration and implementation of phase-in and phase-out for new medicines and regimens at country level?","Yes! GDF provides support to many national TB programmes on the procurement and supply chain aspects of phase-in
and phase-out plans of products or regimens. Please contact GDF at mailto:[email protected] to request support."
What are the estimated costs of the new regimens?,"STBP/GDF estimates the cost of the bedaquiline-based shorter regimen is approximately $650 USD per treatment course.
This estimate uses a weighted average price according to the volumes allocated to suppliers in STBP/GDF’s 2019 tender.
These estimates are valid through the end of the tender period (March 2020).Programmes can estimate costs based on the specific regimens chosen. STBP/GDF has a “Budgeting Prices for TB
Medicines” document to assist programmes when planning. It is available on STBP/GDF’s website. The prices are for budgeting purposes only and may be different from the
price ranges (and thus actual prices that will be found in the final price quote) found in the GDF Product Catalogue. GDF
can assist on quantifying cost implications when developing phase-in and phase-out plans."
"How do I access pretomanid, to be used as part of the BPal regimen under operational research conditions?","Pretomanid is available from STBP/GDF for use with bedaquiline and linezolid under operational research conditions for
the treatment of XDR-TB as a part of BPal regimen. Programmes will be requested to complete an annex to the
procurement request form with their first order of pretomanid from STBP/GDF. This annex will confirm the programme
will use pretomanid in alignment with WHO recommendations, including those made in the Rapid Communication. For
more information on the procurement of pretomanid from GDF, please see the STBP/GDF document."
How do I contact the GDF if I have a question on drug procurement?,Please contact GDF focal point at this email address: mailto:[email protected]
"Estimated costs of new regimens (all-oral STR and BPaL) are different from the previous ones. Assuming budget from domestic, Global Fund and other sources will remain unchanged, how will national programmes be able to achieve and increase their targets?","The implications of transitioning to the new regimens, including the costs and targets, should be assessed for each
country. Any savings from overall costs of MDR/RR-TB and XDR-TB regimens should be used to enroll more patients. New
regimens are expected to be more effective, less toxic and shorter and more convenient for patients and the health
system and this would contribute to improvement in treatment outcome. There should be discussions at all levels to
identify savings (including in the Global Fund grants, domestic, and support by technical partners) and reinvest these to
increase targets, strengthen aDSM, laboratory capacity and improve quality of care. As the MDR/RR-TB and XDR-TB treatment coverages are already low, countries are encouraged to revise and increase the targets agreed in the National
Strategic Plans and Global Fund Performance Frameworks."
"Can I apply for a Global Fund grant to expand services including laboratory for diagnosis/DST, aDSM and patient support?","The NTP could use the existing Global Fund grants to support expansion of services including aDSM and lab capacity to
accelerate transition to new regimens. Use of savings (from reduced costs of new regimens) and/or additional costs
needed for expansion require discussions with the Global Fund country teams. All countries which received Global Fund
allocations for TB are encouraged to include implementation and scale up of the new all-oral regimens (including BPaL)
and other related interventions in their upcoming funding requests during the 2020-2022 cycle."
"Given the anticipated increase in uptake of the agents included in bedaquiline-based all-oral regimens, should programmes expect further decreases in prices for recommended medicines?","The biggest drivers of medicine prices are demand and generic competition. Should these newly prioritized medicines
increase in demand, STBP/GDF, Global Fund and other partners would expect prices to decrease in future tenders."
How do I budget ahead of introducing a new MDR-TB treatment component in my national TB programme?,"NTPs should first decide on the treatment algorithm they will use to determine the allocation of MDR TB regimens. That
algorithm could take into account several factors, such as the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones and other
drugs . Based on that information the NTP would forecast the quantity of medicines that it will need and determine the
level of efforts and other resources that will be required to support the implementation of regimens. The NTP will have to
identify funds that it already has as well as funds that it can mobilize from national budget and from other donors. NTPs
are encouraged to initiate discussions with stakeholders on best scenarios for the introduction of the new treatment
including timing, additional budget needed and potential sources of additional budget. The plan could be finalized after
the release of the new WHO guideline in April 2020."
Will the Global Fund support the introduction of bedaquiline-based modified shorter regimens and/or BPaL under operational research?,"In the past, the Global Fund has supported several countries to pilot the introduction of shorter MDR-TB regimens, ahead of
the WHO recommendation of 2016 and all-oral shorter regimen based on the 2019 guideline under operational research. If a
country is considering introducing bedaquiline-based modified shorter treatment regimen including BPaL as part of
operational research, please contact the Global Fund country teams. Eligible countries can request funds for operational
research on variants of the shorter regimen as far as these are in line with the WHO recommendations. In addition, USAID
has funding allocated for DR-TB and operational research related to shorter regimen for 23 priority countries."
What should patients be aware of regarding the new MDR-TB treatments?,"The new treatment guidelines will emphasize the need for improved communication with persons who are starting MDRTB treatment about the potential benefits of the new regimens and the potential risks. Cautions about key adverse
reactions, such as QT-interval prolongation with drugs like moxifloxacin and bedaquiline, neuropathy for linezolid, and
skin discoloration for clofazimine (see more complete list in Chapter 11 of the Companion handbook). Patients should
also be informed that with the use of pretomanid containing regimen (BPaL), reproductive toxicities have been observed
in animal studies and that the potential effects on human male fertility have not been adequately evaluated at this point
in time.The patient and treatment provider need to find the most acceptable form of communication to ensure continued
treatment follow up.Patients also need to be aware that the benefits of the medications depend upon completing them as prescribed.
Adherence support is important. The basic principle that applies to any TB regimen - to take all the medicines prescribed
for the recommended duration – remains critical. If treatment interruptions occur the clinical team needs to address
them rapidly to ensure resumption of care."
Is informed consent mandatory?,"Informed consent and participatory decision-making are key elements of patient-centred care. All patients receiving TB
care should be informed of the procedures and treatments they are being offered or are receiving in a manner by which
they appreciate the uncertainties, potential risks and benefits, alternative treatment options, as well as the commitments
needed. Ahead of enrolment on any MDR/RR-TB and XDR-TB treatment, with or without new TB drugs, all patients should
be counselled for them to understand the main issues involved with their treatment. This process needs to comply with
the local requirements, including written or verbal consent as necessary. Any patient information material previously
developed for this purpose needs to be updated to reflect the new changes, so that patients are appropriately informed
about their treatment options. Sample information material to use when explaining the options to patients are available
in the WHO Companion handbook (e.g. page 391 in current version)."
What is XDR-TB?,"XDR-TB, an abbreviation for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), is a form of TB which is resistant to at least four of the core anti-TB drugs. XDR-TB involves resistance to the two most powerful anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin, also known as multidrug-resistance (MDR-TB), in addition to resistance to any of the fluoroquinolones (such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) and to at least one of the three injectable second-line drugs (amikacin, capreomycin or kanamycin).MDR-TB and XDR-TB both take substantially longer to treat than ordinary (drug-susceptible) TB, and require the use of second-line anti-TB drugs, which are more expensive and have more side-effects than the first-line drugs used for drug-susceptible TB."
How do people get XDR-TB?,"People may get XDR-TB in one of two ways. It may develop in a patient who is receiving treatment for active TB, when anti-TB drugs are misused or mismanaged, and is usually a sign of inadequate clinical care or drug management. It can happen when patients are not properly supported to complete their full course of treatment; when health-care providers prescribe the wrong treatment, or the wrong dose, or for too short a period of time; when the supply of drugs to the clinics dispensing drugs is erratic; or when the drugs are of poor quality.The second way that people can develop XDR-TB is by becoming infected from a patient who is already ill with the condition. Patients with TB of the lungs can spread the disease by coughing, sneezing, or simply talking. A person needs only to breathe in a small number of these germs to become infected. However only a small proportion of people infected with TB germs develop the disease. A person can be infected by XDR-TB bacteria but not develop the active disease, just as with drug-susceptible TB."
How easily is XDR-TB spread?,"Studies suggest that there is probably no difference between the risk of transmission of XDR-TB and any other forms of TB. The spread of TB bacteria depends on factors such as the number and concentration of infectious people in any one place together, and the presence of people with a higher risk of being infected (such as those with HIV/AIDS).The likelihood of becoming infected increases with the time that a previously uninfected person spends in the same room as an infectious case. The risk of spread increases where there is a high concentration of TB bacteria, such as can occur in poorly-ventilated environments like overcrowded houses, hospitals or prisons. The risk of spread is reduced if infectious patients receive timely and proper treatment."
How can a person avoid becoming infected with XDR-TB?,"While patients with XDR-TB may be as infectious as those with ordinary TB, the chances of a TB infection being XDR-TB is lower due to the rarity of the condition. The measures to be taken are the same as those for the prevention of ordinary TB.Close contact with a patient with infectious TB is to be avoided especially in poorly ventilated spaces. The risk of becoming infected with TB is very low outdoors in the open air. TB patients should be encouraged to follow good cough hygiene, for example, covering their mouths with a handkerchief when they cough, or even, in the early stages of treatment, using a surgical mask, especially when in closed environments with poor ventilation."
How can a person who already has ordinary TB avoid getting XDR-TB?,"The most important thing is for the health care workers and community to provide all the means (information, counselling, and material support) that enable patients to continue taking all their treatment as prescribed.No doses should be missed and above all, treatment should be taken right through to the end. If a patient finds that side-effects are a problem, for example, the tablets make them feel sick, then they should inform their doctor or nurse, because often there is a simple solution. If they need to go away for any reason, patients should make sure they have enough tablets with them for the duration of the trip."
Can XDR-TB be cured or treated?,"XDR-TB patients can be cured, but with the current drugs available, the likelihood of success is much smaller than in patients with ordinary TB or even MDR-TB. Cure depends on the extent of the drug resistance, the severity of the disease and whether the patient’s immune system is compromised.Patients infected with HIV may have a higher mortality. Early and accurate diagnosis are important so that effective treatment is provided as soon as possible. Effective treatment requires that a good selection of second-line drugs is available to clinicians who have special expertise in treating such cases."
How common is XDR-TB?,"By the end of 2016, XDR-TB has been reported by 123 WHO Member States. Information from countries with reliable data suggests that about 6.2% of MDR-TB cases worldwide have XDR-TB.In 2016, there were an estimated 490 000 new cases of MDR-TB worldwide. Only a small proportion of the XDR-TB cases among them are detected given that many low and lower middle-income countries still lack sufficient diagnostic capacity to test for resistance to second-line drugs and thus detect XDR-TB."
How do countries prevent XDR-TB?,"National TB control programmes working with all health services can prevent XDR-TB by ensuring that all practitioners working with people with TB adhere to the International Standards for TB Care.These emphasize providing proper diagnosis and treatment to all TB patients, including those with drug-resistant TB; assuring regular, timely supplies of all anti-TB drugs; proper management of anti-TB drugs and providing support to patients to maximize adherence to prescribed regimens; caring for MDR/XDR-TB cases in services with proper ventilation, and minimizing contact with other patients, particularly those with HIV, especially in the early stages before treatment has had a chance to reduce the infectiousness."
"Can the TB vaccine, known as BCG, prevent XDR-TB?","The BCG vaccine prevents severe forms of TB in children, such as TB meningitis, but is less effective in preventing pulmonary TB in adults, the commonest and most infectious form of TB. It is expected that the effectiveness of BCG against XDR-TB is similar as for ordinary TB. Nevertheless, new vaccines are urgently needed, and WHO is actively advocating for the development of new vaccines."
What is the link between XDR-TB and HIV/AIDS? Why in some places is XDR-TB linked with HIV?,"People living with HIV are at greater risk of developing TB – as well as XDR-TB - than people without HIV, because of their weakened immunity. In few places where XDR-TB strains circulate more frequently, people with HIV are therefore more likely to be infected with XDR-TB than elsewhere. To date, in most of the places with high rates of HIV infection, XDR-TB has not been widespread.For this reason, the majority of people with HIV who develop TB will have ordinary TB and can be treated with standard first-line anti-TB drugs. For those with HIV infection, treatment with antiretroviral drugs will likely reduce the risk of developing XDR-TB, just as it does with ordinary TB. Patients with both XDR-TB and HIV who do not receive antiretroviral drugs are at high risk of dying."
How can I tell if I might have TB or XDR-TB?,"XDR-TB can only be diagnosed in a well-equipped laboratory. Symptoms of XDR-TB are no different from ordinary TB: a cough with thick, cloudy mucus (or sputum), sometimes with blood, for more than 2 weeks; fever, chills, and night sweats; fatigue and muscle weakness; weight loss; and in some cases shortness of breath and chest pain. If you have these symptoms, it does not mean you have XDR-TB.But it does mean you must go and see a doctor for a check-up. If you are already on treatment for TB, and at least some of these symptoms are not improving after a few weeks of medication, you should inform your clinician or nurse."
How quickly can XDR-TB be diagnosed?,"If TB bacteria are found in the sputum, the diagnosis of TB can be made in a day or two. To confirm XDR-TB, however, it may take from 6 to 16 weeks."
Is it safe to travel to places where XDR-TB has been identified?,"XDR-TB is still very rare but has been documented in many countries. People who are most at risk, if they do come into contact with someone with XDR-TB, are those with reduced immunity to infectious diseases, such as those with HIV infection or other medical conditions that can weaken a person's immunity.It is also advised that such people should avoid areas where there are no infection control measures in place. Air travel carries only very minimal risks of infection with any kind of TB. Concerned travellers should seek advice before their visit from their doctor, national authorities, or trusted travel web sites such as, https://www.who.int/health-topics/travel-and-health/."
What should be done if a person has been in contact with a known or suspected case of XDR-TB?,"Anyone who has been in contact with someone known, or suspected of having, XDR-TB should consult their doctor or a local TB clinic and be screened to see if they have TB. This is most important if the person has any symptoms of TB. If they have a cough, they will be asked to provide a sample of sputum, which will be tested for evidence of TB disease.If TB is found, treatment will be started with the drugs to which the person’s TB is most likely to respond. If there is any evidence of infection with TB bacteria but without TB disease, preventive treatment may be given or the person may simply be asked to attend health services periodically for a check up."
Should patients with XDR-TB be isolated while on treatment or after treatment options have failed?,"In order to make the diagnosis, patients with suspected TB or XDR-TB are sometimes admitted to hospital. In order to protect other patients and health workers in the hospital, isolation of such patients is part of good quality care. Once the diagnosis is made and treatment begun, for patients who are willing to undergo treatment, isolation is usually neither necessary nor appropriate.Isolation has a very limited role to play in patients in whom treatment has failed. Studies have shown that treating TB patients at home with appropriate infection measures in place generally poses no substantial risk to other members of the household. By the time a diagnosis is made, the household contacts have already been exposed to the patient’s infection.However, in the absence of options for curative treatment, all infection control measures at household should be strengthened. Whenever this is not feasible then options for voluntary isolation and delivery of palliative and end of life care should be offered to the patient."
"What risks do health-care workers face with XDR-TB, particularly those who may be HIV-positive themselves?","To protect health-care workers who may come into contact with infectious TB patients, appropriate and strict infection control measures must be implemented in health-care facilities at all times. Health-care workers are also encouraged to make sure that they are aware of their HIV status so that they can restrict putting themselves at risk of exposure."
What is WHO doing to combat XDR-TB?,"Firstly, WHO is ensuring that the health authorities responsible for TB care and control receive accurate information about XDR-TB. Latest information on XDR-TB, and related TB issues, are published on the WHO Global TB Programme website.Secondly, WHO advises that good TB prevention, care and control prevents the emergence of drug resistance in the first place, and that the proper treatment of MDR-TB prevents the emergence of XDR-TB.Thirdly, WHO is regularly updating its guidance to Ministries of Health on the management of drug-resistant TB patients and diagnostic policies."
What is vaccine safety?,"Vaccination is a simple and effective way to protect people of all ages against harmful diseases before they come into contact with them. Vaccination is also safe. Side effects from a vaccine are usually minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever. Any licensed vaccine is rigorously tested across multiple phases of trials before it is approved for use, and regularly reassessed once introduced. Scientists also constantly monitor information from several sources for any sign a vaccine may cause health risks, and if there is a concern, they take the appropriate investigative and corrective actions. These vaccine safety monitoring processes ensure that potential risks related to vaccination are kept to the minimum possible level. WHO works to make sure that vaccine safety systems exist everywhere so that anyone who receives a vaccine can have their concerns considered and investigated if needed."
How does a vaccine work?,"To produce protection against a disease, vaccines activate biological reactions in the body. Those reactions vary depending on the type of vaccine and its mode of administration. In addition to developing its protective effect, vaccine reactions may include soreness or a mild fever that resolves in a few days. Severe reactions occur very rarely (less than one in 100 000 doses of vaccines administered) and these generally occur in people with pre-existing diseases. If this risk factor is known beforehand, it is possible to prevent any potential reaction.Proper vaccine storage, handling and administration is also important to ensure that vaccination is safe and effective. This is why WHO recommends that all health care personnel who administer vaccines receive comprehensive training before administering vaccines and are aware of their role in relation to monitoring for rare reactions."
Could there be side effects we don’t know about?,"Some side effects are so rare they can’t be detected even after studying the effects of a vaccine on tens of thousands of people. For that reason, the safety of vaccines continues to be monitored even after they are in routine use. Any reports of possible side effects made by parents and health providers are carefully reviewed and may signal the need for further investigation. In addition, large populations of people who receive vaccines are often studied to identify any possible links between vaccination and rare or serious health conditions. If a problem is suspected, a thorough investigation will take place by health authorities and medical experts. Investigations usually involve more tests of vaccine quality, manufacturing processes, and studies of vaccinated and unvaccinated people who have and have not had reactions."
What can we say to parents who have questions about vaccines?,"It is important to respect parents and acknowledge their need for accurate information to guide the health decisions they make for their children. Babies and children need to get their vaccinations on time, so they get the best possible protection. It is important that health providers invite parents to share their questions and concerns during vaccination consultations and assure them that vaccines are the safest way to protect their children from infectious diseases. Parents can be informed that all vaccines go through lengthy and rigorous testing processes and must pass through many clinical trials before they are approved for use."
What does WHO do to promote safe vaccines?,"The safety of vaccines is closely monitored by WHO, national regulatory agencies and vaccine manufacturers during the vaccine development phase and after vaccines have been registered and are utilized on a large scale.  Possible risks related to vaccines are carefully studied with the help of independent scientists.  A vaccine is registered in countries only if it does provide conclusive protection, if it is manufactured according to the highest standards, and if the risks related to its utilization are very low compared to the benefits.  In addition, WHO provides public information about the known risks of vaccines and how to minimize those risks.  This information is updated as new data or new issues emerge or when improvements are made that can reduce those risks.  For WHO-recommended vaccines, see information sheets."
What are WHO’s accomplishments of the last 20 years?,"The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) is the independent expert group that has advised WHO for the past 20 years.  It meets twice annually and can be consulted any time a new concern is identified by WHO.  GACVS monitors the safety profile of all vaccines recommended by WHO.  Its recommendations are publicly available on its web site.GACVS also publishes warnings every time a particular risk is identified or, importantly, when false rumours can affect the use of a safe vaccine. False rumours or wrong perceptions can endanger the population by depriving it of the protection vaccines provide.GACVS is the driving force behind Vaccine Safety Net – a platform run by WHO assembling trusted web sites from all parts of the world providing reliable information about vaccines.  Those sites can be recognized because they display a WHO-protected visual identity.  As of 19 September 2019, there are 75 sites from 34 countries participating in this network, offering vaccine safety information in 24 languages."
What does WHO’s strategy on vaccine safety propose for the next 10 years?,"The Blueprint 2.0 will be designed for all countries rather than concentrating on low- and middle-income countries.  It will focus on strengthening the capacities of national regulatory authorities, so the quality and safety of vaccines can be assured locally and closer to patients.  It will also foster the coordination of efforts between immunization programmes, regulatory agencies and their partners and highlight the responsibility of vaccine manufacturers in monitoring vaccine safety.  Coordination will include new mechanisms to ensure that vaccine safety strategies are fully operational and work effectively.  Finally, the strategy will highlight the role of communication and reliable information to dispel false allegations and wrong perceptions to sensitize people on vaccines’ tremendous benefits for individual and public health."
What do we need to achieve the new strategy’s goals?,"The mechanisms to implement the strategy are already in place.  More funding will be mobilised to ensure success.Basically, the new strategy is implemented through the Global Vaccine Safety Initiative (GVSI), a broad network of vaccine safety stakeholders who work jointly to improve vaccine safety in countries and globally.  The network develops new tools and methods, provides training, conducts studies related to current issues in vaccine safety, and promotes trusted communication based on science and objectivity.  The GVSI has demonstrated its value with the first Blueprint and is well equipped to address the challenges of the next decade.  In addition to implementing the strategy, progress will be monitored continuously.  The idea is that an independent group, convened by the GVSI Observatory, will do the monitoring.  That way, WHO and partners will receive regular information and advice from respected scientists, not directly responsible for Blueprint implementation, on how to better prioritize their efforts."
What innovations can we expect in the future in terms of vaccine safety?,"Besides products with fewer untoward reactions, novel ways of administering vaccines are also under development.  These include pre-filled syringes that avoid any risk related to the transfer from a vial to a syringe.  Vaccine administration at the surface of the skin with patches is also at advanced stages of development.  The use of nucleic acid that can teach the body to produce self-protection against a disease is another avenue.There will also be improvements in the way safety is monitored.  Larger and faster international information systems will take advantage of new information technology.  Agile reporting systems will increase the way vaccine safety concerns are notified.  International networks will be able to rapidly join forces and test, through computer-based records, if a possible reaction to a vaccine is found in all places that use the same product.Finally, information about vaccines and vaccine safety will be increasingly accessible and verified.  People will benefit from trusted sources that use rigorous science to explain what is known about vaccine risks and how to minimize them."
What does the summit of 2-3 December 2019 hope to achieve?,"The Summit has two main aims:First, to enhance WHO’s work on vaccine safety.  WHO’s current vaccine safety strategy – called the Global Vaccine Safety Blueprint – was published in 2012.  The Blueprint has made enormous progress improving vaccine safety in low- and middle-income countries in the last eight years.  WHO now wants to look to the future and enhance its work to meet the challenges of the new decade and the sustainable development agenda.  These include the emergence of many new vaccines, a more interconnected world and the explosion of global communication. Second, it will feature the most recent from state-of-the-art vaccine safety science as we transition to the next decade.  We have learned a lot in recent years and scientifically resolved many vaccine safety issues from the 20th and early 21st centuries.  New issues, primarily related to novel vaccines, have also appeared and require continuing research.  Today we have new tools and methods to resolve those questions quicker, more thoroughly and through broader partnerships.  A publication will be produced to inform the global health community about the current situation."
What is TB? How does it spread? How is it treated?,"Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that most often affect the lungs. Tuberculosis is curable and preventable.
		TB is spread from person to person through the air. When 
people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into
 the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become 
infected.About one-third of the world's population has latent TB, which
 means people have been infected by TB bacteria but are not (yet) ill 
with disease and cannot transmit the disease.People infected with TB bacteria have a lifetime risk of 
falling ill with TB of 10%. However persons with compromised immune 
systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or 
people who use tobacco, have a much higher risk of falling ill.When a person develops active TB (disease), the symptoms 
(cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss etc.) may be mild for many 
months. This can lead to delays in seeking care, and results in 
transmission of the bacteria to others. People ill with TB can infect up
 to 10-15 other people through close contact over the course of a year. 
Without proper treatment up to two thirds of people ill with TB will 
die.Since 2000, 53 million lives have been saved through effective
 diagnosis and treatment. Active, drug-sensitive TB disease is treated 
with a standard 6-month course of 4 antimicrobial drugs that are 
provided with information, supervision and support to the patient by a 
health worker or trained volunteer. The vast majority of TB cases can be
 cured when medicines are provided and taken properly."
How is the infection transmitted?,"The infection is transmitted by direct or indirect transfer of eye and nose discharges of infected people, particularly young children who harbour the principal reservoir of infection. These discharges can be spread by particular species of flies.In areas where trachoma is endemic, active (inflammatory) trachoma is common among preschool-aged children, with prevalence rates which can be as high as 60–90%. Infection becomes less frequent and shorter in duration with increasing age.The disease thrives especially in crowded living conditions where there are shortages of water, inadequate sanitation and where numerous eye-seeking flies are present. An individual’s immune system can clear a single episode of infection, but in endemic communities, re-acquisition of the organism occurs frequently."
What is trachoma?,"Trachoma is a disease of the eye and the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. It is caused by an obligate intracellular bacterium called Chlamydia trachomatis.After years of repeated infection, the inside of the eyelid can become so severely scarred (trachomatous conjunctival scarring) that it turns inwards and causes the eyelashes to rub against the eyeball (trachomatous trichiasis), resulting in constant pain and light intolerance; this and other alterations of the eye can lead to scarring of the cornea. Left untreated, this condition leads to the formation of irreversible opacities, with resulting visual impairment or blindness. The age at which this occurs depends on several factors including local transmission intensity. In very highly endemic communities, it can occur in childhood, though onset of visual impairment between the ages of 30 and 40 years is more typical."
Where does trachoma occur?,"Trachoma is hyperendemic in many of the poorest and most rural areas of 37 countries of Africa, Central and South America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East.It is responsible for the blindness or visual impairment of about 1.9 million people. It causes about 1.4% of all blindness worldwide.Overall, Africa remains the most affected continent, and the one with the most intensive control efforts. As of 2 January 2020, 13 countries had reported achieving elimination goals. These countries are: Cambodia, China, Gambia, Ghana, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman and Togo. Eight of those countries – Cambodia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Ghana, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal and Oman – had been validated by WHO as having eliminated trachoma as a public health problem."
How is trachoma diagnosed?,"Trachoma disease is usually clinically diagnosed. People are examined for clinical signs through the use of magnifiers (loupes). In most early stages, infection does not present visible signs of the disease. However, repeated infections cause scarring of the conjunctiva and it is during this phase that infected individuals get the feeling of irritation."
What are the clinical signs and how can trachoma be treated?,"The infection is associated with inflammatory changes in the conjunctiva known as “active trachoma”.The WHO grading system for trachoma classifies the disease in 5 grades, depending on the presence of visible signs of the disease. The treatment involves antibiotics to clear infection and surgery for the most advanced cases. Disease grades and associated treatment are listed below.Trachomatous Inflammation – Follicular (TF) - which mostly requires topical treatment. Trachomatous Inflammation – Intense (TI) - during which topical and systemic treatments are considered.Trachomatous Scarring (TS) - when scars are visible as in the tarsal conjunctiva and which may obscure tarsal blood vessels.Trachomatous Trichiasis (TT) - when an individual is referred for eyelid surgery; andCorneal Opacity - a stage during which a person is irreversibly blind."
How can trachoma be prevented and controled?,"Elimination programmes in endemic countries are being implemented using the WHO-recommended SAFE strategy. This consists of:Surgery to treat the blinding stage (trachomatous trichiasis);Antibiotics to clear infection, particularly mass drug administration of the antibiotic azithromycin, which is donated by the manufacturer to elimination programmes, through the International Trachoma Initiative;Facial cleanliness; andEnvironmental improvement, particularly improving access to water and sanitation.Most endemic countries have agreed to accelerate the implementation of this strategy to achieve elimination targets."
What is e-/mHealth?,"eHealth (or “electronic health”) is defined by WHO as the cost-effective and secure use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for health and health-related fields. mHealth (or “mobile health”) is a component of eHealth, and involves the provision of health services and information via mobile technologies, such as mobile phones, tablet computers and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). The collective term ""digital health"" encompasses both of these concepts."
Why is e-/mHealth (digital health) so important for TB prevention and care?,"The application of ICT to health care is a fast developing phenomenon. As the coverage of internet and portable telephony advance at a rapid pace, new perspectives open up to help patients in their quest for health and the health professionals to carry out their work. eHealth and mHealth (known collectively as ""digital health"") could provide new solutions and avenues for action on various aspects of TB prevention, care and control.The factsheet eHealth in the TB Response identifies some of these applications, grouped under 4 functions, namely patient care; surveillance and monitoring ; programmatic management and eLearning. The potential for ICT to combat TB remains under-exploited. Nonetheless, a number of initiatives have already been put in place to improve or study the effect on work processes.For instance TB patients and health care workers alike can use mobile devices to report notifications, encounters, or adverse drug reactions to centralised registers. Cash can be transferred via mBanking to reward patient adherence to treatment. Care-givers can receive alerts on test results via a short message or email. Mobile applications and webpages can be developed to update health care worker knowledge."
What is the WHO Global Task Force on e-/mHealth and TB and what is its mandate?,"The Global Task Force was established in February 2015 and includes experts in different fields of TB care and control, representatives from major technical and financial partners, experts in information and communication technology (ICT), and representatives from countries on the forefront of the response to the TB epidemic.The End TB Strategy approved by the World Health Assembly in 2014, as well as other WHA resolutions and efforts to promote the application by countries of ICT for health (“e/mHealth”) by WHO, define the functions and mandate of the Task Force. In carrying out its work the Task Force upholds the principles of patient-centred care, and ensures that the scope of interventions reach also to health concerns beyond the TB process itself."
What is the Task Force doing to fulfill its mandate?,"In the short term (2015-2017), the Task Force will focus its efforts on two priority areas of work, namely:1. Target product profiles (TPPs) for digital health productsThe characteristics of the desirable ICT products will be defined and specifications will be developed to guide decision-makers on what type of products to have in order to address the challenges posed to health care providers, patients and their families2. Case studies on scalabilityCountry-level or setting-specific projects will be supported to improve the uptake of e/mHealth at large scale"
What is the vision of the Task Force concerning the target product profiles (TPPs)?,"One of the main objectives of the consultation of 25-26 February 2015 was to develop specifications for e/mHealth products considered to be priority solutions for programmatic challenges. These specifications would be formulated in a standardised manner and following a particular methodology within each workstream. The end result would be a strategic document known as a target product profile (TPP).A TPP helps to shape the creation and evolution of the intended product, aligning the needs of end-users with the work that the system developers need to follow in order to satisfy these demands; it provides a possible starting point for the detailed discussions that the various stakeholders need to have in order to bring the product to a successful implementation within a country.Developers require TPPs early on within the production pathway. As a minimum, the TPPs should indicate the purpose of the functionality or system being developed, the goal/s to be met, who are the target end-users and the beneficiaries of the product, and what is the expected impact. The product should also achieve all the “minimal” and most of the “optimal” criteria which are set for each TPP.A TPP should be considered a “living document” which evolves as the project matures. The Task Force is now committed to take forward the work started in the working groups of the consultation and to prepare a first version of the TPPs by mid-2015. Following the production of the first drafts of the TPPs the process will require a broad input from multiple stakeholders."
Who is paying for the work of the Task Force?,"The Global Task Force is composed of experts in their own right who work pro bono. Most of these experts belong to institutions and international agencies which support the objects of the task force and thus provide funding in kind. The European Respiratory Society has financed the technical consultation which led to the creation of the task force and is also providing further support to the group and its activities.The secretariat of the Task Force is provided by the Global TB Programme of the World Health Organization, which is supported by USAID. At country level, most eHealth activities are expected to be funded either from domestic sources or else through external funding, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria and USAID.Research on the effectiveness of mHealth for TB and other health care delivery is being conducted by institutions such as the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the University of Geneva, and the University of British Columbia. The aim of the secretariat and the Task Force is to engage more technical and financing partners to contribute to digital health efforts for TB."
How will the Task Force support countries to strengthen digital health efforts?,"The second priority area of work for the Task Force consists of providing support to countries that have already embarked upon digital health initiatives for TB and which envisage a broader scale-up of these efforts. Projects will be chosen if they are already producing results or for which there are good grounds to expect an effective outcome, based on evidence from trials, from experience in the country or best practices elsewhere.In the first years the projects would need to inform one of the TPPs being developed. The intention of the Task Force is not to run “pilots” but to provide and rally project funding and to furnish technical assistance in implementation and evaluation."
"I want to introduce an electronic system for TB. Can you recommend me one, or will the Task Force be creating one for all programmes?","There is no simple answer to this question. Electronic systems may refer to different things and no two system requirements will look exactly the same, given that they often reflect different expectations, worker preferences, needs, infrastructural possibilities and so on. It is therefore not the objective of this website or the Task Force to develop one, common electronic system to generate the TB programme indicators.The successful adoption of electronic recording and reporting does not start and end at software installation: much of it is also about changing how people work. In 2012, WHO and its partners developed a manual (see below) to guide users on how to assess the gaps and develop specifications focused on the recording and reporting of tuberculosis. If your programme is committed to create a system it is useful to approach the problem in a systematic manner, and you can follow the steps in this manual to develop detailed specifications. The TPP framework described above can be used to organize the different characteristics of the electronic system you aspire to.Electronic recording and reporting for tuberculosis care and controlIt is useful to consult widely on such a TPP and ensure that the health care workers who will be using it have a realistic expectation and the right determination to see it through. They should also envision a system that will lighten and improve their work. The end-users' perspective is crucial but at times neglected."
Where can I find more information on the work of the Task Force and how can I get involved in its work?,"These pages will be updated with information relevant for different users: you can find these on the homepage of ""Digital health in TB care and control"" , particularly under the ""Resources & documents"" and under the “Events” sections. You may also wish to visit the links to the websites of our technical partners: a number of them have some very useful documents with practical knowledge on implementation, assessment, latest news and so on.Some sites like PubMed also list research work published in the scientific literature relating to the application of digital health and some leading peer-reviewed journals are now focused on this dimension of health care delivery. You can also contact the secretariat of the Task Force at falzond(at)who.int"
Are there immediate and long-term health benefits of quitting for all smokers?,"Beneficial health changes that take place:Within 20 minutes, your heart rate and blood pressure drop.12 hours, the carbon monoxide level in your blood drops to normal.2-12 weeks, your circulation improves and your lung function increases.1-9 months, coughing and shortness of breath decrease.1 year, your risk of coronary heart disease is about half that of a smoker's.5 years, your stroke risk is reduced to that of a nonsmoker 5 to 15 years after quitting.10 years, your risk of lung cancer falls to about half that of a smoker and your risk of cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, bladder, cervix, and pancreas decreases.15 years, the risk of coronary heart disease is that of a nonsmoker's."
Can people of all ages who have already developed smoking-related health problems still benefit from quitting?,"Benefits in comparison with those who continued:At about 30: gain almost 10 years of life expectancy.At about 40: gain 9 years of life expectancy.At about 50: gain 6 years of life expectancy.At about 60: gain 3 years of life expectancy.After the onset of life-threatening disease: rapid benefit, people who quit smoking after having a heart attack reduce their chances of having another heart attack by 50%."
How does quitting smoking affect children who are exposed to second-hand smoke?,"Quitting smoking decreases the excess risk of many diseases related to second-hand smoke in children, such as respiratory diseases (e.g., asthma) and ear infections."
Are there any other benefits to quitting smoking?,"Quitting smoking reduces the chances of impotence, having difficulty getting pregnant, having premature births, babies with low birth weights and miscarriage.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			Reference1.

What is pharmacovigilance?,"Pharmacovigilance is defined by WHO as “the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment,
understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other drug-related problem”. WHO identifies two main
approaches to pharmacovigilance: spontaneous and active.Spontaneous (or voluntary) reporting means that no active measures are taken to look for adverse
reactions. Reporting to the national authorities responsible for patient safety is entirely dependent on the
initiative and motivation of the reporters, usually health care professionals and sometimes the patients.
This is the most widespread form of pharmacovigilance globally, and in some countries it is mandated by
law. One of the key disadvantages of spontaneous reporting is that it does not allow an estimation of the
occurrence rates of events Active pharmacovigilance means that measures are taken proactively to detect safety concerns. This is
achieved by active monitoring at start of, during and at times after the end of treatment. The events may
be detected by screening patient records, direct questioning of the patients and through laboratory testing
at predefined intervals."
What is active TB drug-safety monitoring and management (aDSM)?,"aDSM defines the active and systematic clinical and laboratory assessment of patients on treatment for
extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), or with new TB medicines or novel regimens for multidrug-resistant TB
(MDR-TB) to detect, manage and report suspected or confirmed drug toxicities. The recording and reporting
activities of aDSM primarily target the serious adverse events (SAEs) as a priority requirement. MDR-TB
treatment sites may also monitor other AEs which are of clinical significance or of special interest to the
programme, as part of comprehensive aDSM.
aDSM is used to monitor and manage adverse events in patients who receive a particular medication or
treatment regimen and to assess causality. It applies the principles of active pharmacovigilance to the specific
needs and context of national TB programmes and is embedded within the patient monitoring function (e.g.
cohort monitoring) of TB programmes. The management of patient safety is an inherent part of aDSM,
inseparable from its monitoring component.
In aDSM, besides the spontaneously reported reactions, adverse events are also elicited as part of a patient
monitoring plan comprising of a set of questions and oftentimes an array of laboratory/clinical tests at defined
periods of time, before, during and after treatment. The records from active TB drug-safety monitoring thus
make it possible to determine the exact number of patients monitored and the extent of exposure to a
medicine; they also enumerate the events related to an exposure, in a similar way to a longitudinal
epidemiological study.
The WHO Global TB Programme (WHO/GTB) therefore convened key technical and funding agencies to a
meeting in Geneva, Switzerland on 28-29 July 2015 to discuss essential requirements for the implementation of
active pharmacovigilance and proper management of adverse events (AEs) when introducing new anti-TB
medicines or novel MDR-TB regimens. The document Framework for implementation of active tuberculosis drug-safety monitoring and management (aDSM) reflects the consensus achieved during this meeting and in
subsequent discussions also involving NTP managers of selected countries and the WHO Essential Medicines and
Health Products Department (1)."
Why is WHO recommending aDSM?,"WHO recommended the use of bedaquiline, delamanid and the shorter MDR-TB regimen upon condition of
active drug-safety monitoring(2),(3),(4),(5),(6). This recommendation was supported by the independent experts
who reviewed the information available on safety of bedaquiline and delamanid in the Guideline Development
Group meetings held in 2013 and 2014 respectively. Both of these medicines are still relatively new and only a
limited number of patients have been treated with them. In both cases the decision to grant conditional
marketing approval by stringent drug regulatory authorities prior to the completion of Phase 3 trials took into
account the serious nature of MDR-TB and the unsatisfactory outcomes obtained when regimens composed
solely of older second-line drugs are used. Likewise, the 2016 recommendation for a shorter MDR-TB regimen
preceded the results of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of its use. All reasonable measures are thus needed
to ensure that patient safety is monitored alongside the effectiveness of the treatment. In this situation,
spontaneous reporting is not expected to represent an appropriate level of care and more active approaches,
such as aDSM, are considered necessary to improve the early and systematic detection and proper management
of harms. It is also important to collect safety data accurately and undertake causality assessment carefully in
order to ensure that all adverse events are properly investigated and that no premature conclusions are drawn
regarding the attribution of cause. Causality assessment is thus very important."
When does aDSM apply?,"aDSM applies to the following groups:TB patients treated with new medicines, such as bedaquiline or delamanid;TB patients enrolled on treatment with novel regimens, such as the shorter MDR-TB treatment regimen;All XDR-TB patients on second-line treatment (as these regimens often include multiple repurposed
medicines).Once these priority groups of patients are covered, aDSM can be extended to other patients on treatment with
longer MDR-TB regimens."
Do all treatment centres need to apply the same package of aDSM?,"There are three levels of monitoring in aDSM:Core package: requiring monitoring for and reporting of all SAEsIntermediate package: includes SAEs as well as AEs of special interestAdvanced package: includes all AEs of clinical significanceAll centres treating eligible patients with new anti-TB medicines or novel MDR/XDR-TB regimens require the
Core package. These treatment centres should, as a minimum, also be taking part in spontaneous reporting of
ADRs as required by local regulations. Expansion of aDSM should be implemented in a phased approach."
Is aDSM the same as a clinical trial? Will it replace the Phase 3 studies of new medicines?,"No. aDSM remains an observational type of study of a cohort (group) of patients who are taking a particular
medication or regimen. It is intended to be conducted under programmatic conditions, without any
randomization of study subjects to intervention and to control or comparison arms. Operational research on
other aspects of care can be built alongside aDSM, such as a comparator cohort of patients receiving standard
care to be monitored concurrently. Phase 3 trials for bedaquiline and delamanid, which will randomize patients
to control and intervention arms, and RCT data for the shorter MDR-TB regimen and other novel treatment, will
still be needed to look more closely at the efficacy and toxicity of these medicines."
Are there practical examples of aDSM for TB?,"aDSM is a relatively new concept within the span of monitoring activities of national TB programmes. There is
more experience in resource-limited settings with aDSM in treatment programmes for other diseases, such as
malaria and HIV. A number of countries in Africa and elsewhere have recently introduced active drug-safety
monitoring within cohorts of patients treated with the shorter MDR-TB regimen."
Are NTPs expected to implement aDSM even for old TB medicines?,"aDSM is currently being recommended by WHO when TB patients are placed on new or repurposed medicines,
treatment of XDR-TB, or on novel treatment regimens that differ substantially from those in general use.
Programmes can however opt to use aDSM more extensively and there are recent examples where aDSM has
been successfully used for MDR-TB patients on standard regimens without new medicines, or MDR-TB patients
who have repurposed medicines (e.g. linezolid) included in their combination therapy."
"Is it true that for aDSM there is need to follow up least 10,000 patients on treatment?","Apart from detecting known, frequent adverse reactions, aDSM should also provide information about rare and
as-yet unrecognised adverse reactions and drug-drug interactions. The 10,000 figure helps illustrate the point
that when an adverse drug reaction occurs as rarely as once in 2,000-3,000 exposures, only a handful of events
may occur even when large numbers of cases are observed. With a few exceptions, it is not expected that such
numbers accrue in any single country and pooling of data across countries would be needed for a
comprehensive analysis of risk. Sample-size calculation, as is the practice in epidemiological studies, is not being
recommended for aDSM. It is important that health professionals are trained to keep close scrutiny on patients
within an observational study setting to avoid missing rare events. Reporting of SAEs by countries to the global aDSM database established in 2016 will increase the
likelihood that signals of unknown or poorly documented drug-related harms are elicited by analysing pooled
data."
So will WHO change its policy only after at least 10 000 patients have been put on treatment?,"Not necessarily. While detection of rare events is important, the overall aim of applying aDSM when using new
regimens is to develop a safety profile based on a larger number of observations than now. The policy may
actually need to be changed when much less than 10,000 patients receive the medicine if unexpected safety
concerns emerge."
I am a TB programme manager and my programme expects to be treating between 10-50patients on bedaquiline or delamanid in the coming years. Does my programme still need to monitor adverse reactions as intensely as in aDSM?,"Yes. aDSM is important when patients are treated with a medicine for which the drug safety profile is as yet
incomplete. This does not depend on the number of patients enrolled. The best described method to
operationalise active drug-safety monitoring is aDSM. Monitoring needs to be closely associated with early
action to prevent and manage any serious consequences to the individual patient. A national programme should
also strive to capture data in the private sector and public-private partnerships. Similar monitoring is needed for
the shorter MDR-TB regimen."
When using bedaquiline should NTP and health care providers only focus on signs of cardiotoxicity?,"No. aDSM is intended to pick up not only the known reactions associated with a medicine but also any
unexpected effect of treatment (some of these may actually be beneficial to the patient). It is expected that the
adverse reactions which are already known to be associated with a new medicine or regimen will occur among
the patients treated and these need to be detected early. However, for medicines like bedaquiline and
delamanid, which have only been administered to a relatively limited number of patients, a broader perspective
needs to be applied."
If a patient gets a reaction how can I tell which medicine is causing it (all MDR-TB patients are having combination TB chemotherapy)?,"The most common adverse reactions to be expected of a medicine are often those which have already been
reported in patients exposed to it and which result from interactions with concomitant medication. Some of
them can be plausibly explained by the pharmacodynamics / pharmacokinetics of a medicine.
However, with medicines that have not yet undergone Phase 3 trials, the number of patients exposed to
treatment is relatively low and important adverse reactions may not yet be well characterized. Continued
vigilance for unknown or unrecognised untoward effects is important. When multiple drugs are used, an
important method which is used to assess causality is dechallenge +/- rechallenge (withdrawal +/-
reintroduction), with observation of the clinical effects. In the case of new medicines it is crucial that a causality
assessment is undertaken and the findings communicated prudently, as incorrect attribution of harms to any of
these medicines could lead to irreversible harm to their reputation and even reflex withdrawal from markets,
thus depriving patients of the potential benefits of the medicines."
Many MDR-TB patients get mild reactions on treatment. Should NTP and health care providers just focus on the serious adverse events (SAEs)?,"For aDSM, all centres treating eligible patients with new TB medicines or novel MDR-TB regimens require the
Core package that requires reporting of all SAEs. However, proper clinical and laboratory management as well as
detection and treatment of all adverse drug reactions must be in place. All SAEs detected should be reported to
the national authority responsible for pharmacovigilance according to individual country requirements and
should be regularly assessed for causality. In addition to the priority requirement to monitor SAE, M/XDR-TB
treatment sites may also monitor other AEs which are of clinical significance or of special interest to the
programme, as part of comprehensive aDSM. aDSM may also be expanded in a phased approach to eventually
cover TB patients on treatment with any second-line medicines."
How do I know that an event is “serious”? Is it the same as a “severe” event?,"Seriousness is a dimension of an event that differs from severity, relating more to the consequences of an
event. A serious event is one which either leads to death or to a life-threatening experience; hospitalization or
prolongation of hospitalization; persistent significant disability; or congenital anomaly. In contrast severity is a
subjective assessment made by the patient and/or the health care professional of the intensity of an event and
relates to its impact on the patient’s activities. Severity is often classified on a three-point scale from “mild”
through “moderate” to “severe”, commonly on the basis of a clinician’s judgement. Practitioners may however
want something less subjective on which to base their classification. There are different scales to classify
severity (such as DAIDS(7), CTCAE(8), and ANRS(9)). Any of these can be used; it is important to note that none
of them have been developed specifically for TB medicines and some adaptations may thus be needed. An
event may be severe but not serious, or vice versa, or both: most commonly they are neither."
Do I classify death as a serious event?,Death is considered an outcome rather than an event. An event which leads to death is considered serious.
What do I do if a patient on a new medicine dies or sustains a serious disability? Should I stop the medicine for all patients?,"MDR-TB patients on treatment are known to have a higher risk of dying than other TB patients. Medicines like
bedaquiline and delamanid may be used in a subset of MDR-TB patients who are at an even higher risk of dying.
Careful examination of serious events in patients on this treatment must thus be done to ascertain the
circumstances leading to death or disability. If the episode cannot be explained by what is known about the
pharmacology of the medicine the manufacturer should be alerted. Programmes need to inform manufacturer
within 24 hours of deaths and serious adverse events occurring in patients on the new medicine. It is important
that any unexpected reaction with a serious or fatal outcome due to a medicine is rapidly identified and
investigated. Equally important is that no hasty conclusions are drawn on causality within a context of very
limited treatment options for a serious condition and where the confidence of patients and health-care
professionals in a potentially life-saving medicine could be irreparably damaged. Programmes should prepare
what to do in the event of a serious episode, including how to communicate it factually and constructively. The
WHO Collaborating Centre in Uppsala, Sweden has produced a comprehensive
publication based on experience from real-life situations which provides helpful instruction on how best to act
under such circumstances(10)."
How much does it cost to implement aDSM? Can NTP or partners put this in the Concept Note to be submitted to the Global Fund?,"The main costs associated with aDSM relate to initial preparation for the training of staff, information and
education of patients, the production of data collection materials, and the creation or adaptation of a database
in which to consolidate the data. Once the system is in place, much of the running costs will represent marginal
expenses of an additional surveillance activity albeit the labour costs may be substantial. The total amount will
vary between countries and depends on the number of centres involved. Programmes should obtain technical
advice to cost their specific needs more accurately (the costs can also be calculated using the WHO Planning and Budgeting Tool for TB control activities; programmes should set aside at least USD50,000 to provide for the
initial preparations). The costs for aDSM may be included in a request for funding to the Global Fund under the
New Funding Model."
Do NTP and health care providers need to have aDSM up and running before they order orenrol patients on bedaquiline or delamanid?,"Fully functional aDSM is not required up front at the time of ordering the medicines or starting patients on
treatment. However, two key elements need to be in place so that the essential safety data are collected for all
patients the moment that they are started on regimens containing a new medicine: creation of the standard
data collection materials (e.g. paper or electronic forms;  see sample forms); and staff properly
trained to collect the data. The NTP needs to assign someone from the start to coordinate the process, ensure
that the two minimum elements are in place; and develop a protocol and have it approved. In this work, the
person should ideally involve experts from relevant disciplines convened by the NTP to steer aDSM at national
level (this could be one function of the MDR committee or consilium). Local capacity for aDSM needs to be built
within the TB and/or drug-safety monitoring centre over the following months. Table 1 shows how the 8 key
steps for the establishment of aDSM could be addressed in the process of patient recruitment, building upon the
strengths of the framework that NTPs are accustomed to when monitoring their patients for treatment response
and outcomes. There is a substantial amount of additional work that is required to mount and maintain aDSM
but the traditional monitoring approach inherent to TB programmes is a clear advantage over other disease
programmes when implementing aDSM."
Can NTP and health care providers monitor the safety of patients on new medicines using something “lighter” than the core package of aDSM?,"This is not recommended, since the aDSM Core package is already a minimum requirement for monitoring drug
safety in TB programmes. While it is important that additional demands for data from both the programme and
the patients are minimised, the essential data elements need to be collected in accordance with the time
schedule established by the programme. Without this it will be difficult if not impossible to undertake
meaningful causality assessment as well as signal detection, both locally as well as at global level."
Do NTP and health care providers need ethics clearance to undertake aDSM?,"The same local requirements for ethics approval that govern routine public health surveillance activities should apply. Attention must be paid to the confidentiality of patient information.Table 1. Implementation of the 8 steps for aDSM in TB programmesStepsNeeded ahead of patient recruitmentCreate a national coordinating mechanism for aDSMThe NTP needs to assign someone from the start to coordinate the introduction of aDSM. This should ideally involve experts from relevant disciplines convened by the NTP to steer aDSM at national level (e.g. as one function of the MDR committee)Develop a plan for aDSMIn part; this can be a supplement to the national TB guidelines and the full detail can be worked into it at a later stageDefine management and supervision roles and responsibilities
            The main responsibilities need to be assigned to the main actorsCreate standard data collection materials
            Yes; the essential data elements for aDSM should ideally be worked into the standard TB treatment card for second-line treatment. Otherwise, if separate data collection forms will be used, templates for both the initiation and review questionnaires
                are available on the WHO website (see also FAQs)Train staff on the collection of data
            Yes; this should be done alongside the training of health care workers on how to use the new medicine. It is best to have a training module which combines adverse drug reaction reporting as part of the indicators for MDR-TB monitoringDefine schedules and routes for data collection and reportingIn part; the collection of data (be it on the adapted treatment card or on special forms) would be done during the scheduled patient visits for the Initiation (baseline) and Review of treatment. For causality assessment, more data may be needed
                from a patient or physician and this should preferably be done as soon as possible after the eventConsolidate aDSM data electronically
            Not essential initially; can be developed in the months following the first enrolments although delay in data entry should be avoided.Develop capacity for signal detection and causality assessment
            This will usually require specialist skills and is only expected to be developed with time within the TB and/or drug-safety monitoring programmes"
Is patient consent required during aDSM implementation?,"WHO recommends informed consent as one of the conditions for use of the new medicines and guidance on
what this should include is provided in the Annexes to the Companion handbook to the WHO guidelines for the
programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis (11). This covers also the areas of confidentiality and
sharing of information. It makes it clear that given the limited experience on these medicines, programmes are
collecting patient information to improve knowledge on them, while making a commitment to keep all medical
information confidential and to make all information anonymous before it is shared or analysed beyond the
clinical staff looking after the patient."
Where do I get the aDSM questionnaire?,"Rather than creating new data collection forms it would be best to insert the essential data elements into the
existing patient TB treatment card so that the aDSM data are collected as a matter of routine, alongside other
patient details at initial registration and during the follow up visits. For instance the treatment card developed
by the UNION for the multicentre study of shorter MDR-TB regimens is one example of how this could be done.
Ideally data should be collected electronically at source, via mobile devices or desktop (12). Otherwise, please refer to the sample data collection forms (""Questionnaires""), which can be freely adapted for use at country level."
"I have read your handbooks and realised that I do not know how to code adverse events,or to do signal detection and causality assessment. Is there a training course that I canfollow on this?","These tasks require specialist input and such expertise may be housed in the drug-safety monitoring centre of
your country. It is therefore important that liaison with the national centre responsible for drug safety is
established early so that this component of aDSM is addressed. Also, in many countries international partners
are working in the field of pharmacovigilance and introduction of new medicines. They can provide technical
assistance and trainings, per country request."
I was told that there is no centre doing drug-safety monitoring in my country. Who will help me do this?,"If you are considering starting aDSM and there is no functional national drug-safety monitoring centre please
contact WHO for advice on how to access expertise or training on active drug-safety monitoring and aDSM. You
can also collaborate with international partners working in your country in the field of pharmacovigilance and
introduction of new medicines (such as Challenge TB Project, MSH/SIAPS, etc.)"
Where do I send the data collection forms after I complete them? And how often?,"The data - or forms if aDSM data collection is organised using paper “questionnaires” - are best transferred to
the place where their contents will be databased, either at the facilities, within the TB programme or at the
national drug-safety monitoring centre. An arrangement will need to be found on how to check the contents of
the forms for completeness and errors, make corrections, copy or scan their contents, register them
electronically, and store the paper forms safely and confidentially for a number of years before destruction
(standard operating procedures - SOP - are encouraged). The data or forms need to be consolidated as
frequently as the analysis for causality is done; in the case of a serious adverse event this should be done rapidly
after. Local legal requirements may govern the reporting and assessment of events. Local capacity needs to be
built to ensure that this process runs effectively. It is highly recommended that countries use an electronic
database (either an existing one or a new one) in order to collect and report aDSM data."
Will WHO be setting up a registry of patients on new medicines?,"In order to revise its interim guidance on bedaquiline and delamanid in the coming years, WHO will need to
assess the evidence drawn from global experience with these medicines. For this a pooled analysis of data from
several countries is envisaged. The method by which this “supranational” analysis will be done involves the use
of a global aDSM database, established by WHO/TDR in 2016."
Our drug-safety monitoring centre tells me that we need to send all the questionnaires to somewhere in Sweden. Can you give me the email or fax of the person to send it to?,"The reporting to the global aDSM database, which is physically located in Luxembourg, follows a specific methodology. It is important that countries consolidate
their aDSM data in as standardised a manner as possible from the beginning so as to facilitate the comparability
of episodes when analyses are performed on data pooled from various units located in different parts of the
world. It is highly recommended that countries use electronic database (either existing or developing new one)
for collecting, and reporting aDSM data."
If WHO is not collecting the individual patient data then why do we need to collect them?,"aDSM is primarily meant to help the national programmes undertake appropriate clinical management and
surveillance for adverse events among their own patients when they are treated with novel regimens and new
medicines such as bedaquiline and delamanid. The methods described for establishing aDSM are meant to
ensure that there is a sound framework for a systematic, regular monitoring of adverse events (information
elicited through questions to the patient and a series of laboratory and clinical examinations) to be observed at
defined time-points before, during and after treatment. The collection of standardized data for this purpose will
thus be important and it is crucial that this is organized properly early on. The recommended standards for the
collection of essential data elements have been compiled into a “data dictionary” by WHO and its partners. WHO anticipates that the policies on the use of
bedaquiline and delamanid will be updated within a few years as new data are generated. An analysis of multicountry data will be needed to inform this process. Using data collected across different national cohorts will
bring the number of cases observed closer to the total needed for a rare event to have a reasonable likelihood
of being detected. It will also diversify the profile of the population exposed in terms of key demographic and
clinical characteristics, such as age-group, comorbidity, ethnicity, and the background regimen to which the new
medicine is added."
What is the difference between the drug-safety data collected through aDSM by the NTP and the data to be collected and reported to Janssen in relation to the bedaquiline donation programme?,"Safety data of patients receiving bedaquiline under the bedaquiline donation program needs to be reported to
the NTP through aDSM mechanism. Data collection and reporting forms for the USAID Bedaquiline Donation
Program is the same as for generic aDSM reporting. Practitioners involved in managing patients with bedaquiline
need to follow the aDSM approach and report SAE to NTP, national medicines regulatory authority or the
national pharmacovigilance centre in the country. Additional information in relation to the bedaquiline donation
program can be accessed at the GDF website. The use of electronic databases is expected to hugely simplify the task to generate outputs and reports for different
purposes from a consolidated source."
Why do NTP and health care providers need to use the standard data dictionary if they are only going to analyse the data in the country?,"Besides the sharing of data for pooled analysis across different countries the data need to serve the purposes of
the national programmes. For this purpose it is also important that the data are collected in a systematic
manner which permits comparability of events between different patients and over time. Many programmes
will not be familiar with some of the data which are needed and the dictionary will help them understand these
elements. Ideally these data are integrated within the existing stationery (e.g. TB treatment card) or electronic
database used for TB patients, in order to avoid duplication of data collection."
How do I analyze the data? Can you give me the name of consultants who can help me do this?,"The analysis of data should best be done by an expert in drug safety: this is usually the duty of the national drugsafety monitoring centre. For more advanced analyses the expert input of a specialist in the field of biostatistics
may also be necessary. If this expertise is not available in the country you may contact WHO for further advice.
You can also collaborate with international partners working in your country in the field of pharmacovigilance
and introduction of new medicines (such as Challenge TB Project, SIAPS etc.)"
Is there software to analyse the questionnaire data?,"The USAID-funded SIAPS program provides a free web-based tool called PViMS for data collection, monitoring
and analysis of adverse events as recommended for aDSM. PViMS tool is suitable for management and analysis of aDSM data in low and middle income
countries. aDSM data collected from treatment sites can be analysed at the national level in collaboration with
TB and drug safety monitoring authorities in-country to make quick evidence-based decisions to improve the
safety of TB patients. Some national TB programmes are either expanding their existing electronic database for
TB patients to accommodate the additional variables needed to collect data for aDSM; others are creating
special databases solely for aDSM. When creating new systems it is important to ensure a good collaboration
between the TB and drug-safety monitoring authorities and to adhere to the best practices recommended by
WHO (see reference below). The analysis of the data requires a systematic approach: line-listing and eye balling
of all episodes is a first step (this can be done with any spreadsheet package). Any suspected associations may
be tested for statistical significance using univariate techniques or multivariable regression; a number of
software packages can do this (e.g. R, STATA, SAS). Data from country-based information systems such as PViMS
can be routed directly for integration in the global aDSM database."
How do I create the drug safety profile?,"An outline of a drug safety profile is provided in Table 11.5 of Chapter 11 of the 2014 Companion handbook to
the WHO guidelines for the programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis(11). It is not expected that
a full “safety vs. benefit” profile of a medicine can be based on the experience of any one single country and
therefore the more data that are available the better the reliability of the profile. The elaboration and updating
of drug safety profiles will be informed in part by evidence derived from the global aDSM database."
What are the indicators that NTP and health care providers need to report to WHO for patients on aDSM?,"Five basic indicators are proposed (Table 2) and they are explained further in the 2014 Companion handbook to the WHO guidelines for the programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis(11) (see in particular Table 11.5 in Chapter 11). For a number
    of them stratifications are recommended, such as by organ class or by seriousness. Out of the five indicators, the first and the third are considered essential to have in aDSM. As for all other aspects of aDSM, the indicators are primarily intended
    to help programmes assess the safety of the new medication and not solely as outputs to report to WHO.Table 2.

How has the tobacco industry previously manipulated people and attracted new users?,"As awareness of the harms of tobacco use grew and global tobacco control efforts intensified over the last decade, social acceptability of tobacco use declined. This catalysed the tobacco industry to revisit old tactics to restore its tarnished reputation
    and secure a new generation of users. The tobacco industry has made well-researched, calculated attempts to redesign and rebrand its products to sustain profitability. It introduced cigarette filters and the so-called “light” and “mild” tobacco products as an alternative
    to quitting, reducing tobacco users’ perceptions of risk and harm, and undermining effective tobacco control policies. Such misleading marketing continues today, with the industry advocating for the harm reduction approach
    through new products such as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS), commonly referred to as ‘e-cigarettes’, and heated tobacco products (HTPs)."
How are tobacco and related industries marketing new and emerging products?,"E-cigarettes are often promoted as “reduced risk”, “smoke-free”, “socially acceptable” consumer products. These promotional strategies have the potential to renormalize smoking and drive long-term use of addictive nicotine
    products which, like tobacco, are undoubtedly harmful to the consumer, under the guise of being a healthier alternative. Tobacco and related industries exploit the fact that the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes have not been established and
    they are not yet regulated in most countries, enabling them to work around tobacco advertising bans and promote use of their products in smoke-free environments. Some manufacturers also tend to talk about e-cigarettes with HTPs together, thereby confusing potential consumers, and making it difficult to tell the difference between a tobacco and a non-tobacco product. These social-positioning techniques, coupled
    with strategic marketing tactics, are particularly effective in targeting children and adolescents and have the potential to sustain nicotine addiction in youth globally."
What sponsorship schemes are used to manipulate children and adolescents?,"Celebrity and influencer endorsements. Advertising is increasingly shifting to social media platforms, and the nicotine and tobacco industries are no different. “Influencers” on social media who reach and engage children
        and adolescents are invited by these industries to serve as “brand ambassadors” or offered financial incentives to promote their products.  Social influencers have the potential to give their audiences the impression of more authentic
        promotion of the products, particularly when posts do not disclose the sponsorship details.Scholarships. Tobacco and ENDS-related entities have offered scholarships to high school, college and graduate students, some requiring applicants to submit essays on the dangers of tobacco and the potential benefits
        of ENDS use.School programmes and youth camps. Tobacco and
 ENDS-related entities have paid schools for the opportunity to speak in classrooms or after school. They have also sponsored summer camps to spread misconceptions about
        the risks of ENDS use and market their products under the guise of promoting “safer alternatives” to conventional tobacco products."
"What advertising tactics are used to target new, young consumers?","Digital and social media advertising. With the pervasiveness of smartphones and constant Internet access, nicotine and tobacco companies have strategically used digital and social media platforms to reach younger generations,
 including through their favourite apps and video games. Social media platforms allow users to interact with the marketing features, which increases exposure and influence among children and adolescents. They also allow marketers
        to access profile details of users and their friends and effectively target potential customers. Countries that have adopted advertising, promotion and sponsorship bans, but have not explicitly banned cross-border advertising, are
        susceptible to exposing their youth to digital and social media advertising originating from other countries. Just over 100 hashtags associated with tobacco companies have been viewed more than 25 billion times around the world between 2007-2016.Attractive displays in retail shops. Vendors near schools are frequently paid to display nicotine and tobacco products in their retail shops, along with sleek point-of-sale display boards, attractive marketing materials and bright,
        colourful cases to attract young customers.  Modern, attractive retail spaces with a wide variety of products that appeal to youth are also now commonly used to market new and novel products.Advertising materials and products at eye-level of children. In many countries, nicotine and tobacco products can be found at children’s eye levels and near shops selling toys, electronic gadgets, sweets, snacks or soda."
What is the global impact of tobacco use?,"Tobacco consumption is the single largest preventable cause of 
death, killing more than 7 million people each year, of which  more than
 6 million are users or ex-users of tobacco, and around 890 000 are 
nonsmokers exposed to second-hand smoke.  More than 80% of these deaths 
occur in low- and middle-income countries. Tobacco kills many people at 
the height of their productivity, depriving families of breadwinners and
 nations of a healthy workforce."
What is tobacco control?,"Tobacco control refers to a range of comprehensive measures to 
protect people from the effects of tobacco consumption and second-hand 
tobacco smoke.  To control tobacco use, countries can: 
protect people from exposure to tobacco smokeban tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorshipban tobacco sales to minorsrequire health warnings on tobacco packagingpromote tobacco cessationincrease tobacco taxationcreate national coordinating mechanisms for tobacco control.Tobacco control represents a powerful tool in improving health
 in communities and in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). SDG target 3.4 is to reduce premature deaths from NCDs by one 
third by 2030, including cardiovascular and chronic respiratory 
diseases, cancers, and diabetes."
What is the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control?,"The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is 
an international treaty designed by countries as the most powerful tool 
to reduce the health and economic burden caused by tobacco. It entered 
into force in 2005, and implementation of the Convention is called for 
in target 3.a of the Sustainable Development Goals. The WHO FCTC is one 
of the most rapidly embraced treaties in the history of the United 
Nations.
		There are 180 Parties to the Convention, which is legally 
binding, meaning that Parties are required to take incremental action to
 prevent tobacco consumption, marketing and exposure, among many other 
measures. The Convention contains core demand- and supply-reduction 
provisions of proven effectiveness and calls for enhanced international 
cooperation. It also requires Parties to protect their tobacco control 
and public health policies from commercial and other vested interests of
 the tobacco industry."
Why must countries implement the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control?,"Increased trade, foreign investment, global marketing and other
 complex international phenomena have led to the globalization of the 
tobacco epidemic. As the epidemic transcends national borders, its 
control requires international cooperation and multilateral regulation. 
		The WHO FCTC was developed as a global response to the 
globalization of the tobacco epidemic. There is no doubt that reducing 
the rates of uptake and consumption of tobacco will save lives and that 
the WHO FCTC is the evidence-based tool with which to do it.By becoming Parties and implementing the provisions of the WHO
 FCTC where it counts most – at the country level – countries are 
working towards a tobacco-free world and towards millions of lives 
saved."
What marketing ploys are used to attract children and adolescents to nicotine and tobacco products?,"Flavours that appeal to youth. Tobacco products, such as smokeless and water pipe tobacco, are sold in sweet and fruity flavours, which may increase appeal to non-smokers and mask the harsh tobacco taste.  To date, researchers have identified over 15,000 e-cigarette flavours available, including flavours proven to appeal to youth, such as cotton candy and gummy bear.  Advertisements of flavoured products may enhance appeal and encourage children and adolescents to buy and try nicotine products. The flavours may lower perception of the harmfulness and addictiveness of nicotine products.Sleek, pocket-sized designs. ENDS and HTPs are extensively promoted as modern, high-tech and high-end lifestyle products, with minimalist designs, and high-profile product launches that portray them as attractive and harmless products. The sleek designs can be deceptive, available in shapes resembling a USB flash drive, and can be easily concealed in a young person’s hand.Cartoon characters. Some ENDS-related entities use cartoons and child-friendly imagery, such as unicorns, to brand their products and market sweet flavours."
What promotional tactics are used to tempt children and adolescents?,"Product placement in entertainment media, such as television and cinema. 
Children and adolescents who watch movies and television shows containing depictions of smoking are at an increased risk of initiating smoking.  Exposure to tobacco products or e-cigarette marketing in entertainment media influences children and adolescents’ intention to use these products
.Free product samples. 
Nicotine and tobacco product samples are distributed in high traffic areas, and particularly venues frequented by youth, such as street corners, shopping malls, festivals and concerts, to attract new consumers. In over 50 countries, at least 10% of students aged 13-15 reported ever being offered a free cigarette by a tobacco company representative. 
Merchandise with company logos.
 In over 120 countries, at least 1 in 10 students aged 13-15 reported having an object with a tobacco company logo on it."
What distribution mechanisms are used to facilitate access to these products?,"Single stick cigarettes. The sale of cigarettes individually or in small packets increases the affordability and accessibility of tobacco products for school children. Young people that start experimenting with single stick
        cigarettes do not benefit from exposure to health warnings on cigarette packs. A recent investigation in 45 countries found that students aged 13-15 reported recently purchasing single cigarettes, and in some countries, as many as 80% of students
        reported purchasing single cigarettes .Disposable e-cigarettes. The option to test and toss different flavours of e-liquids, particularly for a low initial cost, has driven use of disposable e-cigarettes among children and adolescents.In some countries, where
        flavours are banned in refillable cartridge-based e-cigarettes, children and adolescents have turned to disposable e-cigarettes to continue using flavoured products.Vending machines. Tobacco vending machines provide young people with easy access to tobacco products without needing to provide a form of identification to verify age. In some countries, tobacco vending machines are placed in areas
        frequented by youth, such as near schools, with attractive advertising and pack displays.Internet sales. Nicotine and tobacco products sold online facilitate sale to minors, particularly where age verification mechanisms are not in place . Online sales also allow children and adolescents to purchase products
        being sold in other countries where regulations may differ."
"How can HIA be used in projects, programmes and policies?","HIA has mostly been used on projects, but it has been used on policies and programmes also. This ability to be used in a wide variety of settings is one of the strengths of the HIA approach. However the use of HIA at the strategic level, during the development of policies is one of the most exciting aspects of HIA. It can be used for policy development at local, regional, national, or international levels. Funders can also use HIAs to ensure that projects and programmes consider health, for example, the Asian Development Bank has guidelines for HIA use (Birley 1992)."
How can HIA assist policy development?,"Within the policy process, HIA is best used early on, while there is still maximum time to influence the policy as it develops. Many of the changes that occur within a policy occur during its development, well before it is put out for formal consultation. A close and trusting relationship with policy makers is obviously required to achieve this. The HIA influences development simply by the policy makers knowing that health will be assessed, and therefore they consider health issues more explicitly when developing the policy, and the policy maker having access to people with health knowledge on a regular basis to discuss issues with (both formally and informally)."
How can HIA bring policies and people together?,"HIA is a crosscutting approach that requires many stakeholders to be involved. This helps to develop partnerships between people and organisations – getting people together from diverse backgrounds to begin talking about health (and subsequently other topics!). Partnership working is strengthened by the HIA approach. This way of working also encourages people to see links between the policy being assessed, and other policies being implemented or developed. Often, time and resources are saved when such linkages are made, and policies are strengthened."
How does HIA provide information for decision-makers?,"Decision-makers can also use the HIA to help decide between multiple policy options that are put forward to them, or to assist in deciding on policy changes based on the HIA recommendations."
What is the role of public in HIA?,The local community is a stakeholder that is included within most HIAs. Decision-makers often want to include the perceptions and opinions of the local community within policies [link to why use hia] and an HIA can help to address any community concerns. Decision-makers can then act secure in the knowledge that community views have been represented in the information they have been provided.
Can HIA help address policy-making requirements?,"There are many requirements that policy makers must meet, at international, national and local levels. There is guidance/requirements to work across sectors; consider sustainability; reduce inequalities; and consider the health impact/well-being/quality of life on local communities. HIA has the ability to assist policy makers with these requirements."
What other factors influence policy?,"There are many influences on the policy process and many different information sources feeding in, with HIA being just one of these. This is why it is so important to involve decision-makers early on in the HIA process, to alert them to the upcoming HIA recommendations and ensure there are no surprises for decision-makers.Other than by HIA, health can be taken into account in the development of policies and programmes by:Joint committees, inter-sectoral councils, working groups, etc,Audits, providing auditors understand the link between health and other policy areas),Strategies and programmes that cut across policy areas (and include health),Within environmental impact assessment (if health is addressed),Budget and planning processes (if health is considered),Individual action of officials to influence other policies,Memorandum of understandings, andIntegrated appraisal and screening tools."
How can HIA influence outcomes?,HIA looks for negative impacts of developments (to prevent or reduce them) and because HIA is often undertaken prospectively – looking into the future – it offers the unique advantage of preventing damage from occurring. But HIA also looks for positive health impacts of proposals. This often provides decision-makers with options to strengthen and extend these features of the proposal.
What is taeniasis and cysticercosis?,"Taeniasis is an intestinal infection caused by 3 species of tapeworm: Taenia solium (pork tapeworm), Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm) and Taenia asiatica. Humans can become infected with T. saginata or T. asiatica when they consume infected beef meat or pig liver tissue, respectively, which has not been adequately cooked, but taeniasis due to T. saginata or T. asiatica has no major impact on human health. Therefore, we refer here only to the transmission and health impacts of T. solium.
Infection with T. solium can result in two distinct conditions: taeniasis and cysticercosis. While the adult tapeworm in the human intestine (taeniasis) does not have major health impacts, humans can also develop cysticercosis with tapeworm larvae (cysticerci) in the muscles, skin, eyes and the central nervous system, with possible devastating effects on health. When cysts develop in the brain, the condition is referred to as neurocysticercosis. Symptoms include severe headache, blindness, convulsions and epileptic seizures and can be fatal.
Neurocysticercosis is the most frequent preventable cause of epilepsy worldwide, and is estimated to cause 30% of all epilepsy cases in countries where the parasite is endemic."
Where do the diseases occur?,"Reliable, detailed epidemiological data on geographical distribution of T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis in people and pigs is scarce, but can be estimated based on reported human and porcine cysticercosis cases and known risk factors like water and sanitation indicators, and data on pig production, population and geographic conditions.T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis mainly affects the health and livelihoods of subsistence farming communities in developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. It is common in areas where animal husbandry practices are such that pigs and cattle come into contact with human faeces. But imported taeniasis can also lead to cases in the population of countries where T. solium is not considered a public health problem."
How is it transmitted?,"Taeniasis is acquired by humans through the inadvertent ingestion of tapeworm larvae (cysticerci) in undercooked pork. Once in the human body, cysticerci develop into adult tapeworms that live in the intestine and release egg-bearing gravid proglottids (segments) which are passed out with faeces.Cysticercosis is acquired when worm proglottids or eggs are ingested and the developing larvae migrate through the body and form cysts in tissues. This is the case in pigs and cattle but it can also affect humans, usually when they swallow T. solium egg-contaminated soil, water or food (mainly vegetables) or through self-infection when hygiene practices, such as hand washing after the toilet, are unsufficient. When the central nervous system is affected by the larvae, the infection is called neurocysticercosis."
What are the symptoms of the diseases?,"Taeniasis is usually characterized by mild and non-specific symptoms. Abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea or constipation may arise when the tapeworms become fully developed in the intestine, 6–8 weeks after ingestion of the meat containing cysticerci. These symptoms may continue until the tapeworm dies following treatment, otherwise it may live for years.For T. solium cysticercosis, the incubation period is variable, and infected people may remain asymptomatic for years. In some endemic regions (particularly in Asia), infected people may develop visible or palpable nodules (a small solid bump or node which is solid that can be detected by touch) beneath the skin (subcutaneous). These cysts are generally discovered by the host following spontaneous degeneration of the parasite or after treatment, where an inflammatory reaction may occur.Neurocysticercosis is associated with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the number, size, stage and location of the pathological changes as well as the host’s immune response and the parasite’s genotype, but it can also be clinically asymptomatic. Symptoms may include chronic headaches, blindness, seizures (epilepsy if they are recurrent), hydrocephalus, meningitis, dementia and symptoms caused by lesions occupying spaces of the central nervous system."
How are taeniasis and cysticercosis diagnosed?,"Improved, simple, cost-effective and rapid diagnostic tools are still needed for use in field conditions to detect T. solium carriers as well as human and porcine cysticercosis cases, and to direct programme planning and monitoring.WHO and partners are addressing the lack of a suitable diagnostic toolbox by developing standards for diagnostic products tailored to the needs in countries and especially field settings."
How are these two diseases treated?,"Taeniasis can be treated with praziquantel (5–10 mg/kg, single-administration) or niclosamide (adults and children over 6 years: 2 g, children aged 2–6 years: 1 g; children under 2 years: 500 mg, single-administration after a light meal followed after 2 hours by a laxative).Currently, clinical management and treatment guidelines for neurocysticercosis are being developed by an expert panel with secretariat in WHO. So far, treatment has to be tailored to the individual case. Treatment of active disease may include surgery and/or long courses with praziquantel and/or albendazole, as well as supporting therapy with corticosteroids and/or anti-epileptic drugs, since the destruction of cysts may lead to an inflammatory response. The dosage and the duration of treatment can vary greatly and depend mainly on the number, size, location and developmental stage of the cysts, their surrounding inflammatory edema, acuteness and severity of clinical symptoms or signs."
Q. What are the Triple Billion targets?,"The Triple Billion targets are an ambitious initiative to improve the health of billions by 2023. As the foundation of WHO’s Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW13), the Triple Billions function both as a measurement and a policy strategy. They are an integral part of the GPW13’s Results Framework, a new tool designed to measure and improve WHO’s impact on health at the country level. Additionally, measurement of these targets has been consciously aligned with those of the SDGs, to reduce country burden in data collection and streamline efforts to accelerate progress towards achieving key targets.Finally, the Triple Billions will focus on the execution and delivery of significant improvements in the health of the world’s population through evidence-based interventions, strengthened health information systems, and support for transformational public health policy."
Q. What are the objectives of the Triple Billion targets?,"The goals of the Triple Billions are simple and straightforward. By 2023, WHO proposes to achieve:   1 billion more people benefitting from universal health coverage   1 billion more people better protected from health emergencies   1 billion more people enjoying better health and well-being. However, the Triple Billions have implications beyond these three targets. Measuring the Triple Billions highlights the considerable gaps in public health data that exist in many parts of the world. Therefore, strengthening data collection and monitoring across all levels will be key to achieving both the Triple Billions and SDGs, and will have long-term implications for improving the health of the world."
Q. How are the Triple Billion targets calculated?,"Each of the Triple Billions will be assessed at the population level, and are designed to count lives that benefit from direct intervention. The choice of methods used to calculate the Triple Billions follows extensive debate and consultation with experts from a wide range of disciplines and backgrounds and has been documented as the GPW13 Methods Report. The resulting estimates will be best approximations given multiple variables, including the definition of the Triple Billions, limitations of indicator data availability and quality, and variations in country and regional contexts. Additionally, the design of the targets and their methods is such that countries can independently calculate their contributions to each of the Triple Billions, helping inform their own target-setting for national health priorities."
Q. What are the limitations of the Triple Billion methods?,"The Triple Billions are inherently broadly defined and they are linked to the GPW13 programme and its indicators. They are primarily based on SDG data, which WHO has committed to using for minimizing any additional burden of data collection, and to reinforce progress towards those global aims. Additionally, the accuracy of calculating the Triple Billions is constrained by large data gaps, disparate sources and quality of data, and delays in availability of the data for the calculations. Additionally, in many instances the indicators being used are proxies and not an exact measure. For example, the use of prevalence of raised blood pressure as a proxy for hypertension treatment as part of the UHC Billion. In other cases, important health indicators relevant to the Triple Billions were not defined at the time of the SDGs and so those indicators are missing (e.g. cancer screening and treatment, treatment of mental disorders, and physical inactivity). Despite these limitations, the Triple Billions provide an important mechanism to measure progress, and it is through the monitoring and use of this data that we will see accelerated improvements to the health of citizens."
Are suicides preventable?,"Yes, suicides are preventable and effective interventions exist. First and foremost, early identification and treatment of depression and alcohol use disorders are key for the prevention of suicide at individual level, as well as follow-up contact with those who have attempted suicide and psychosocial support in communities. Equally important are effective interventions at population level aiming to reduce access to the means of suicide, to adopt responsible reporting of suicide by the media, and to introduce alcohol policies to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. From the health systems perspective, it is imperative for health-care services to incorporate suicide prevention as a core component."
How many people attempt suicide every year?,"There are indications that for each person who dies of suicide there are likely to be more than 20 others who attempt suicide. This ratio differs widely by country, region, sex, age and method."
Is suicide really a problem? How many people die by suicide every year?,"Every year close to 800 000 people die as a result of suicide. This is one death every 40 seconds. Beyond this, suicide has a ripple effect that impacts on societies, communities, friends and families who have lost a loved one to suicide. So, yes, suicide really is a serious public health problem."

What is WHO doing to tackle the problem of SF medical products?,"WHO provides the secretariat to the Member State Mechanism to address SF medical products. This is a member states forum who have agreed an 8 point work plan to increase co-operation, collaboration and co-ordination, increase capacity and awareness and encourage surveillance and information sharing to fight SF medical productsWHO has launched a global surveillance and monitoring system to encourage countries to systematically report incidents involving SF medical products. The objective is to provide immediate technical support and coordination in emergencies, but also to establish a validated body of evidence of incidents to identify vulnerabilities and make policy recommendations. WHO have conducted regional and national workshops training regulatory, pharmacovigilance and laboratory specialists from Member States in the use of the system and building capacity in the prevention, detection and response to SF Medical Products. This system has already led to the provision of technical support to member states, access to laboratory testing facilities and issue of international medical product alerts. The system will be rolled out to more member states.WHO will continue to work with member states to develop evidence based policy, strengthen regulatory capacity, improve reporting and vigilance and encourage multi-stakeholder collaboration to tackle SF medical products."
What is the role of the Member State Mechanism?,"The Member State Mechanism is the global forum at which Member States can convene, coordinate, decide and organise activities to address SF medical products.It was established in order to protect public health and promote access to affordable, safe, efficacious and quality medical products, through effective collaboration among Member States and the Secretariat, the prevention and control of substandard and falsified medical products and associated activities."
What does the WHO surveillance and monitoring system do?,"The Global Surveillance and Monitoring System for SF medical products was launched in 2013. It is open to all Member States and the largest procurement agencies have been sensitized in the use of the system. Roll out is continuing and its purpose is two-fold,To provide technical support in emergencies, link incidents between countries and regions, and issue WHO medical product alerts.Accumulate a validated body of evidence to more accurately demonstrate the scope, scale, harm caused by SF medical products and identify the vulnerabilities, weaknesses and trends.It is designed to encourage trained focal points in National Regulatory Agencies and International Procurement Agencies to report incidents involving suspected SF medical products in a systematic and structured way to WHO. These reports permit a fast response to emergencies and the issue of alerts in the most serious cases. It also permits in depth analysis of the medical products most at risk, vulnerabilities and weaknesses in health systems, the harm caused to public health and the need for investment, capacity building and regulatory strengthening. All of which assists in developing evidence based policy."
When do WHO issue medical product rapid alerts?,"The principal objective of a WHO medical product alert is to ensure a timely, proportionate, and consistent response to health events arising from SF medical products which represent a significant threat to International public health.The Surveillance and Monitoring unit within the Safety and Vigilance Team of the Essential Medicines and Health Products Department will take the following criteria into account before issuing a Medical Product Alert:Has the report been validated? Does a genuine and significant risk to public health exist? Does the risk extend beyond the Country where the product was discovered? Have any warnings or alerts concerning the product subject of this incident already been issued, and if so where? Have adequate steps already been taken to remove the product from the supply chain? Is the report recent or is it likely the product remains in circulation?"
"What are substandard, unregistered/unlicensed, and falsified medical products?","Substandard: Also called “out of specification”, these are authorized medical products that fail to meet either their quality standards or specifications, or both.Unregistered/unlicensed: Medical products that have not undergone evaluation and/or approval by the National or Regional Regulatory Authority (NRRA) for the market in which they are marketed/distributed or used, subject to permitted conditions under national
    or regional regulation and legislation.Falsified: Medical products that deliberately/fraudulently misrepresent their identity, composition or source.Seventieth World Health Assembly update, 29 May 2017
Working Definitions Document approved by the Seventieth World Health Assemblypdf, 203kbDefinitions of SF Medical Products"
Do WHO investigate those involved in manufacturing SF medical products?,"WHO are not the competent organization to deal with the Criminal Investigation or prosecution of those involved in the manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products. It is a National responsibility to conduct criminal investigations. Countries
    are also able to call upon assistance from INTERPOL and EUROPOL in coordinating International Investigations against SF medical products who both have specialist personnel dealing with falsified medicines.INTERPOL"
Do WHO work with the pharmaceutical industry?,"When WHO are notified of an SF medical product by a Member State we will always ask if the genuine manufacturer (innovator or generic) is known and has been contacted. If requested by a Member State WHO will contact the manufacturer to establish the facts. Samples of the suspect medicine may be sent to the genuine manufacturer for laboratory analysis. Where appropriate WHO will always contact the genuine manufacturer, in addition to a quality control laboratory, if the SF product is imitating a WHO pre-qualified product, or if WHO is considering issuing a global medical products alert."
Do WHO work with INTERPOL and World Customs Organizations?,"Both of these law enforcement organizations carry out operational activity to tackle SF medical products.Whilst WHO does not participate in these operations, it is important to better understand precisely which medical products are being seized and clarify which are unlicensed, substandard or falsified products. It is also necessary to ensure a focus on public health and determining if an immediate and serious risk exists in relation to any seized products. Some of these operations take place at ports of entry and some within the market place.It is also important to validate the information gathered by these organizations and assess more accurately the scope, scale and harm caused by SF medical products, informing post market surveillance in countries and identifying the medical products most at risk.INTERPOL"
"Know the IHR; purpose, scope, principles and concepts","The International Health Regulations (2005) (hereinafter ""the IHR"" or “the Regulations”) are an international agreement that is legally binding on 194 countries (States Parties), including all WHO Member States. The IHR define their ""purpose and scope"" as: ""to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade"". Since their entry into force on 15 June 2007, the IHR directs and governs particular WHO and States Parties activities aiming that protect the global community from public health risks and emergencies that cross international borders.These activities are implemented in ways that are consistent with other international law and agreements; their implementation must ""be with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedom of persons"" and ""guided by the goal of their universal application for the protection of all people of the world from the international spread of disease"".The scope of the IHR is purposely broad and inclusive in respect of the public health event to which they have application in order to maximize the probability that all such events that could have serious international consequences are identified early and promptly reported by States Parties to WHO for assessment. The Regulations aim to provide a legal frame work for the prevention, detection and containment of public health risks at source, before they spread across borders, through the collaborative actions of States Parties and WHO.Notification is required under IHR for all ""events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern"". In this regard, the broad new definitions of ""event"", ""disease"" and ""public health risk"" in the IHR are the building blocks of the surveillance obligations for States Parties and WHO. ""Disease"" means ""an illness or medical condition, irrespective of origin or source, that presents or could present significant harm to humans"". The term ""event"" is broadly defined as ""a manifestation of disease or an occurrence that creates a potential for disease"". ""Public health risk"" refers to ""a likelihood of an event that may affect adversely the health of human populations, with an emphasis on one which may spread internationally or may present a serious and direct danger"". A public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) is defined as ""an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response"". Consequently, events of potential international concern, which require States Parties to notify WHO, can extend beyond communicable diseases and arise from any origin or source.The IHR explicitly allow WHO to take into account information from sources other than official notifications and consultations, and, after assessment, to seek verification of specific events from the concerned States Parties. Notification to WHO marks the beginning of an exclusive dialogue between the notifying State Party and WHO on further event assessment, potential investigation and any appropriate local or global public health response.The responsibility for implementing the IHR rests jointly with States Parties and WHO. In order to be able to notify events, or respond to public health risks and emergencies, States Parties must have the capacity to detect such events through a well established national surveillance and response infrastructure. States Parties are required to collaborate actively with each other, together with WHO, to mobilize the financial resources to facilitate the implementation of their obligations under the IHR. Upon request, WHO assists developing countries in mobilizing financial resources and provides technical support to build, strengthen and maintain the capacities set out in Annex 1 of the Regulations."
Update national legislation,"An adequate legal framework to support and enable all of the varied IHR State Party activities is needed in each country. In some countries, giving effect to the IHR within domestic jurisdiction and national law requires that the relevant authorities adopt implementing legislation for some or all of the relevant rights and obligations for States Parties. However, even where new or revised legislation may not be explicitly required under a country's legal system for implementation of one or more provisions in the IHR, revision of some legislation, regulations or other instruments may still be considered by the country in order to facilitate performance of IHR activities in a more efficient, effective or otherwise beneficial manner. Additionally, from a policy perspective, implementing legislation may serve to institutionalize and strengthen the role of IHR capacities and operations within the State Party, as well as the ability to exercise certain rights contained in the Regulations. A further potential benefit from such legislation is that it can facilitate necessary coordination among the different entities involved in implementation and help to ensure continuity. For these reasons, States Parties to the IHR should consider assessing their relevant existing legislation to determine whether they may be appropriate for revision in order to facilitate full and efficient implementation of the Regulations."
Recognize shared realities and the need for collective defences,"The recognition that globalisation brings with it new challenges and opportunities for preventing the international spread of disease was the starting point for the revision of the International Health Regulations (1969) or ""IHR (1969)"". In 2003, the outbreak and eventual control of SARS convinced the world's governments of the necessity for a collective and coordinated defence against emerging public health threats, providing the impetus needed to complete the revision process. The IHR were adopted by the Health Assembly on 23 May 2005, and entered into force on 15 June 2007.The IHR legal framework supports existing and innovative approaches in the global detection of events and response to public health risks and emergencies. The current Regulations were built in part on the foundations of their predecessor, the IHR (1969), and were primarily based on the experiences of WHO and its Member States in national surveillance systems, epidemic intelligence, verification, risk assessment, outbreak alert, and coordination of international response, all of which are part of WHO’s decade-long work to enhance global public health security.In contrast to the IHR (1969), the current Regulations have a broad scope, provide for the use of a wide range of information and emphasize collaborative actions between States Parties and WHO in the identification and assessment of events and response to public health risks and emergencies. In WHO's coordination of the international response to public health emergencies of international concern, maximum measures are replaced by formally recommended and context-specific temporary health measures, tailored to the actual threat faced."
Monitor and report on IHR implementation progress,"States Parties and WHO alike are required to report to the World Health Assembly on IHR implementation. To date, this requirement has been fulfilled through annual reporting by the WHO Secretariat to its governing bodies. Using information gathered through questionnaires, the WHO Secretariat has summarized the activities carried by countries to implement the IHR. It is anticipated that, in the future, this data will be collected using specific indicators currently under development. In addition to this, the IHR Coordination Department collaborates closely with WHO Regional Offices and other relevant departments and programmes to report on WHO’s work in support of IHR implementation."
"Notify, report, consult and inform WHO","The IHR describe key elements of the procedures to be followed by States Parties and WHO in terms of information sharing with regard to notified events. Official event-related communications under the IHR are carried out between the National IHR Focal Point and their corresponding regional WHO IHR Contact Point, both of whom are officially designated and required to be available on a 24 hour basis, 7 days a week.The IHR (2005) specify three ways in which States Parties can initiate event-related communications with WHO:Notification – Under the IHR, States Parties are required to notify WHO of all events that are assessed as possibly constituting a PHEIC, taking into account the context in which an event occurs. These notifications must occur within 24 hours of assessment by the country using the decision instrument provided in Annex 2 of the Regulations. This decision instrument identifies four criteria that States Parties must follow in their assessment of events within their territories and their decision as to whether an event is notifiable to WHO:Is the public health impact of the event serious?Is the event unusual or unexpected?Is there a significant risk of international spread?Is there a significant risk of international restriction(s) to travel and trade?Notifications must be followed by ongoing communication of detailed public health information on the event, including, where possible, case definition, laboratory results, source and type of the risk, number of cases and deaths, conditions affecting the spread of the disease and the health measures employed.Consultation - In cases where the State Party is unable to complete a definitive assessment with the decision instrument in Annex 2, State Parties have an explicit option of initiating confidential consultations with WHO and seeking advice on evaluation, assessment and appropriate health measures to be taken.Other Reports - State Parties must inform WHO through the National IHR Focal Point within 24 hours of receipt of evidence of a public health risk identified outside their territory that may cause international disease spread, as manifested by imported or exported human cases, vectors which carry infection or contamination, or by contaminated goods.In addition to these three types of communications, States Parties are required under the IHR to respond to WHO Requests for Verification. WHO has an express mandate to obtain verification from States Parties concerning unofficial reports or communications, received from various sources, about events arising within their territories which may constitute a PHEIC; these reports are initially reviewed by WHO prior to the issuing of a verification request. States Parties must acknowledge verification requests by WHO within 24 hours and provide public health information on the status of the event, followed, in a timely manner, by continued communication of accurate and sufficiently detailed public health information available to the notifying State Party."
"Understand WHO’s role in international event detection, joint assessment and response","The IHR underpin WHO’s mandate to manage the international response to acute public health events and risks, including public health emergencies of international concern. The Regulations also recognize WHO's general surveillance obligations, and set out specific procedures for concerned States Parties and WHO to collaborate in the assessment and control of public health events and risks, even before such events have been officially notified to WHO.At the international level, WHO’s real-time analysis of public health events uses technical knowledge, an understanding of the situational and operational context, and risk communication requirements to assess public health risks in accordance with WHO’s mandate under the IHR. To further strengthen international alert and response capabilities, an enhanced event-management system and standard operating procedures have been developed by WHO. This web-based tool functions as the official repository of all information relevant to an event that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern. It facilitates communications within WHO, with National IHR Focal Points, with technical institutions and partners, and provides timely public health information for the management of these events and risks.Information relating to public health risks notified or reported under the IHR (2005) to WHO is jointly assessed with the affected State Party to ascertain the nature and extent of the risk, the potential for international disease spread and interference with travel and trade, and appropriate response and containment strategies.In order to meet its IHR obligations and to facilitate information sharing between the Organization and States Parties to the Regulations, WHO has established an IHR Event Information Site. This site is accessible to National IHR Focal Points and provides up-to-date information on ongoing public health events of international concern."
Participate in the PHEIC determination and WHO recommendations-making processes,"PHEIC determinations and the issuing of corresponding WHO recommendations by the Director-General will be a rare occurrence. Indeed, since the entry into force of the IHR on 15 June 2007 only one such determination has been made and recommendations issued. It is important that States Parties to the IHR are aware of the processes that may affect them and of their right to be consulted and present their views.If immediate global action is needed to provide a public health response to prevent or control the international spread of disease, the IHR give the Director-General of WHO the authority to determine that the event constitutes a PHEIC. On such occasions, an IHR Emergency Committee provides its views to the Director-General on temporary recommendations on the most appropriate and necessary public health measures to respond to the emergency. A State Party affected by a potential emergency needs to work closely with WHO to ensure that all relevant information and considerations are brought to bear prior such a determination and the adoption of any corresponding temporary recommendations. However, the right of a State to be consulted or prevent its views to an Emergency Committee shall be without prejudice to the need to act swiftly in the event of an emergency.In cases where the State Party concerned may not agree that a PHEIC is occurring, the Emergency Committee will also provide advice. The temporary recommendations issued by the Director-General are for affected and non-affected States Parties in order to prevent or reduce the international spread of disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic."
Strengthen national surveillance and response capacities,"Another fundamental aspect of the IHR is the obligation for all States Parties to develop, strengthen and maintain core public health capacities for surveillance and response. In order to be able to detect, assess, notify and report events and respond to public health risks and emergencies of international concern, States Parties must meet the requirements described in Annex 1A of the IHR (2005). Annex 1A outlines these core capacities at the local (community), intermediate and national levels, including, at the national level, the assessment of all reports of urgent events within 48 hours and the immediate reporting to WHO through the National IHR Focal Point, when required.The IHR require each State Party, with the support of WHO, to meet the core surveillance and response capacity requirements ""as soon as possible"", but not later than five years after the date of entry into force for that country. The IHR set out a two-phase process to assist States Parties to plan for the implementation of their public health capacity obligations. In the first phase, from 15 June 2007 to 15 June 2009, States Parties must assess the ability of their existing national structures and resources to meet the core surveillance and response capacity requirements. This assessment must lead to the development and implementation of national plans of action. As specified in the IHR, WHO must support these assessments and provide guidance on the national planning and implementation of these capacity strengthening plans.In the second phase from 15 June 2009 to 15 June 2012, the national action plans are expected to be implemented by each State Party to ensure that core capacities are present and functioning throughout the country and/or its relevant territories. States Parties that experience difficulties in implementing their plans may request an additional two year period until 15 June 2014 to meet their Annex 1A obligations. On the basis of a justified need, an extension of two years may be obtained. In exceptional circumstances, and supported by a new implementation plan, the Director-General of WHO may grant an individual State Party a further extension not exceeding two years to meet its obligations."
Increase public health security at ports airports and ground crossings,"International points of entry, whether by land, sea or air, provide an opportunity to apply health measures to prevent international spread of disease. For this reason, many of the provisions addressing this aspect in the IHR (1969) have been updated in the IHR (2005). A number of new provisions have been included. When applying IHR-related health measures to international travellers, for example, it is required that they be treated with courtesy and respect, taking into consideration their gender, sociocultural, ethnic and religious concerns. They must be supplied with appropriate food, water, accommodation and medical treatment if quarantined, isolated or otherwise subject to medical or public health measures under the IHR (2005).States Parties are required to designate the international airports and ports and any ground crossings which will develop specific capacities in the application of the public health measures required to manage a variety of public health risks. These capacities include access to appropriate medical services (with diagnostic facilities), services for the transport of ill persons, trained personnel to inspect ships, aircraft and other conveyances, maintenance of a healthy environment as well as ensuring plans and facilities to apply emergency measures such as quarantine."
Use and disseminate IHR health documents at points of entry,"The IHR require the implementation of a range of health documents at ports, airports and ground crossings. Failure by States Parties to use and include these documents in their daily operations may result in unnecessary disruption to international traffic.Model Ship Sanitation Control Exemption Certificate/Ship Sanitation Control CertificateThe Ship Sanitation Control Exemption Certificate/Ship Sanitation Control Certificate replaced the narrower in scope Deratting/Deratting Exemption Certificate on 15 June 2007.Model Maritime Declaration of HealthThe Maritime Declaration of Health reflects the broader scope of the IHR and currently accepted technical standards and terminology.Model International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis replaces the International Certificate of Vaccination or Revaccination against Yellow FeverYellow fever is the only disease specifically designated under the IHR for which proof of vaccination or prophylaxis may be required for travellers as a condition of entry to a State. The “International certificate of vaccination or revaccination against yellow fever” was replaced by the “International certificate of vaccination or prophylaxis” (ICVP). Clinicians issuing the certificate should note that the main difference from the old certificate is that they have to specify in writing in the space provided that the disease for which the certificate is issued is “yellow fever”. The ICVP does not contain a references to a designated vaccination centre.Health Part of the Aircraft General DeclarationThis is a document of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations agency. The document is periodically reviewed by ICAO Member States, and has historically, for practical purposes, been reproduced in the annexes of the IHR. Consequently, the July 2007 revision of the Declaration adopted by ICAO has been reproduced in the 2008 second edition of the IHR (2005)."
What are substandard and falsified medical products?,"Substandard and falsified (SF) medical products are medicines, devices and other products manufactured to imitate or replace similar certified products. They may 
contain no active ingredient, the wrong active ingredient or the wrong 
amount of the correct active ingredient.They are also found to commonly contain corn starch, potato starch or chalk.Some substandard and falsified medical products have been toxic in
 nature with either fatal levels of the wrong active ingredient or other
 toxic chemicals.Substandard and falsified medical products are often produced in 
very poor and unhygienic conditions by unqualified personnel, and 
contain unknown impurities and are sometimes contaminated with bacteria."
How big is the problem of SF medical products?,"SF medical products are by their very nature difficult to detect. They are often designed to appear identical to the genuine product and may not cause an obvious adverse reaction, however they will fail to properly treat the disease or condition for which they were intended. There are many estimates of the scope and scale of the market in SF medical products but little validated evidence to underpin those estimates. WHO have withdrawn all of their previous estimations of the scale of the problem and in 2013 launched a global surveillance and monitoring system to encourage Member States to report SF incidents in a structured and systematic format, to assist in arriving at a more accurate and validated assessment of the scope, scale and harm caused by this issue. Medical products have so far been reported representing all main therapeutic categories and representing both innovator and generic medicines.In November 2017, WHO launched two important publications;WHO Global surveillance and monitoring system for substandard and falsified medical products, which highlights the causes, consequences and solutions.Study on the public health and socioeconomic impact of substandard and falsified medical products, which examines estimates of the prevalence and cost of the issue;Both publications provide more information on the scope, scale and harm of substandard and falsified medical products."
Which medical products are most affected?,"Reports received by WHO from Member States suggest that all therapeutic categories are affected by SF medical products. Anti-infectives, anti-malarials and genito urinary/sex hormones are particularly badly affected. Expensive cardio vascular and oncology products are targeted as well as low priced pain suppressants. Generic and innovator medical products are both vulnerable to falsification as are the most expensive to the cheapest products. Those engaged in the manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products have shown they respond quickly to demand, thoroughly understand the market and are fast to exploit opportunities."
Where do SF medical products come from?,"SF medical products are manufactured in many different countries and in all WHO regions. Member States and the media frequently report successful operations against manufacturers of SF medical products. Some reports refer to large scale manufacturing and others to small back street operations. With the availability of tableting machines, ovens, specialist equipment, ingredients and packaging materials, clandestine manufacturing facilities are quick and easy to assemble and have been discovered in all regions."
Which countries are affected the most?,"No countries remain untouched by this issue and work is being done in all WHO Regions. What was once considered a problem suffered by developing and low income countries has now become an issue for all. With the exponential increase in internet connectivity those engaged in the manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products have gained access to a global market place. This extends both to consumers and business to business forums. A culture of self-diagnosis and self-prescribing has led to the emergence of thousands of unregulated websites providing unsupervised access to SF medical products. However it is low and middle income countries and those in areas of conflict, or civil unrest, with very weak or non-existent health systems that bear the greatest burden of SF medical products."
What is the harm caused by SF medical products?,"Assessing the harm caused by SF medical products is complex and difficult. Most cases involve a medical product that fails to work properly. Often the product will not cause a toxic reaction, but will fail to treat the condition for which it was intended, with potentially devastating consequences. A patient failing to respond to their anti-malarial or who suffers an unwanted pregnancy will rarely consider the cause of the problem to be their medicine. Effective vigilance and awareness amongst healthcare professionals, efficient reporting mechanisms for patients as well as strong post market surveillance of medical products in circulation are needed in order to quickly identify problems.Some SF medical products do cause serious adverse reactions and sometimes fatalities. When these incidents occur in a close geographic area over a short time period they are more easily identified and reported.Cases are reported to WHO arising from an unexpected and disproportionate rise in mortality at healthcare facilities. The WHO Global Surveillance and Monitoring System and other WHO vigilance systems pick up these data.In November 2017, two important WHO publications were launched:WHO global surveillance and monitoring system for substandard and falsified medical products, which highlights the causes, consequences and solutions.Study on the public health and socioeconomic impact of substandard and falsified medical products, which examines estimates of the prevalence and cost of the issue;Both publications will provide more information on the scope, scale and harm of substandard and falsified medical products."
How do SF medical products enter the supply chain?,"Most commonly, SF medical products enter the legal supply chain at distribution level through hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and wholesalers, who have obtained medical products from unknown sources and intermediaries without checking their credentials or conducting any due diligence. Supply chains can be long and complex. The more extended the supply chain, the more vulnerable they are to weak links and the insertion of SF medical products.SF medical products are frequently found in unlicensed and illegal outlets, this includes street markets, hawkers and illegal internet pharmacies. However, they are also reported from legal and regulated venues such as hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and drug stores in all regions. These are precisely the locations where patients should have the highest degree of confidence that the medical products they receive are safe, good quality and effective."
Are deterrents strong enough?,"Many countries have started to strengthen their legislation in respect of substandard and falsified (SF) medical products and specifically intentionally falsified medical products. Traditionally sanctions have been weak and remain so in many countries. Strong legislation alone is not enough, criminal justice systems need to be willing to handle these types of cases in an effective and efficient manner. National medicines regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies need to collaborate and awareness raising is required amongst the prosecutors and the judiciary. Many investigations concerning SF medical products are international in nature. This makes gathering evidence more complex. Countries need to have in place mutual legal assistance treaties to permit gathering of evidence from other jurisdictions to support prosecutions. Member States with legal powers to restrain and confiscate assets and recover the proceeds of criminal activity have met with some success. Especially if laws allow for a proportion of the seized assets to be reinvested in purchasing detection devices and laboratory equipment or finance awareness campaigns and training events.In broad terms the manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products is a low risk/high profit activity with disproportionately low sanctions, and as such has attracted the attention of organised criminal activity."
Is organised crime involved in SF medical products?,"Some of those involved in the manufacture, distribution and supply of spurious, falsified and counterfeit medical products have access to sophisticated networks of off shore companies to facilitate the movement of the products, off shore bank accounts to launder the proceeds and flexible freight networks to ship the products to their eventual destinations. They operate a highly organised, professional, lucrative and criminal business. Others involved are relatively disorganised with small illegal manufacturing sites and local distribution.In broad terms the manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products is a low risk/high return activity with disproportionately low sanctions, and as such has attracted the attention of organised criminal activity."
Is there a need for international law about these products?,"The manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products is a global issue. With the globalization of the pharmaceutical sector and wide access to internet and communications technologies, no single country or organization can hope to effectively tackle the problem in isolation.Some aspects of the issue require a regulatory response, others a criminal law response, but most require international collaboration. Many countries rely on existing mutual legal assistance treaties, extradition treaties and co-operative arrangements, others do not have those facilities available.Having an effective regulatory and criminal legal framework in place at the national level, with dissuasive sanctions, is the first step towards preventing the proliferation of SF medical products. However, in addition to legislation an efficient investigative process and transparent criminal justice system is required to ensure the proportionate application of the law.The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) have carried out some work on developing a legislative framework in relation to this topic focusing on fraudulent medicine.The Council of Europe have drafted the Medicrime convention, which constitutes a binding International Instrument in the field of criminal law on the counterfeiting of medical products and similar crimes involving threats to public health."
How can I spot an SF medical product?,"Some falsified medical products are almost visually identical to the genuine product and very difficult to detect. However, many can be identified through the following steps:
Examine the packaging for condition, spelling mistakes or grammatical errors.Check the manufacturing and expiry dates, and ensure any details on the outer packaging match the dates shown on the inner packaging.Ensure the medicine looks correct, is not discoloured, degraded or has an unusual smell.If you suspect it is not working properly or have suffered an adverse reaction, discuss with your pharmacist or Doctor as soon as possible."
How can I avoid SF medical products?,"The following steps will help minimise the risk from SF medical products:Source from trusted and licensed outlets, e.g. pharmacies, clinics, doctors, hospitals, health centres.Avoid unregistered websites supplying medical products that conceal their physical address or landline telephone number.Examine the packaging for condition, spelling mistakes or grammatical errors.Check the manufacturing and expiry dates.Ensure the medicine looks correct, is not discoloured, degraded or has an unusual smell.If you suspect it is not working properly or have suffered an adverse reaction, discuss with your pharmacist or Doctor as soon as possible."
What should I do if I think I have an SF medical product?,"You should discuss your suspicion with a pharmacist, Doctor or other healthcare professional. You should also report your suspicion to the National Medicines Regulatory Authority.In cases where you have suffered an adverse reaction to the medicine, including its failure to work properly, you should report this to a healthcare professional immediately."
Are SF medical products available on the internet?,"Unregulated websites supplying medicines, particularly those concealing their physical address or landline telephone number are frequently the source of unlicensed, substandard and falsified medical products. Consumers should be aware of the followingDo not respond to SPAM e mail advertising medicinesLook for a verification logo or certificate and check it out for authenticityLook for spelling mistakes and poor grammarBeware websites that do not display a physical address or landlineBeware websites offering prescription only medicines without a prescriptionBeware suspiciously low priced products or 2 for 1 offersOn receipt of medicines that you have purchased on line consumers should check the followingHave you received exactly the medicine you orderedIs it the correct dosageIs the packaging in good condition, clean, with a patient information leaflet and in the language in which it was advertisedDoes the medicine look, feel and smell as it shouldIf security seals are present are they intact with no sign of tamperingDoes any Customs declaration or postal label declare the contents as medicinesDoes the batch number and expiry date on the primary internal packaging match the batch number and expiry date on the secondary (external) packagingHave you noticed any unusual activity on your credit card since the purchase European UnionUS Food and Drugs AdministrationUS National Association of Boards of Pharmacy"
What are health inequities or inequalities?,"Health inequities are avoidable inequalities in health between groups of people within countries and between countries. These inequities arise from inequalities within and between societies. Social and economic conditions and their effects on people’s lives determine their risk of illness and the actions taken to prevent them becoming ill or treat illness when it occurs.Examples of health inequities between countries:the infant mortality rate (the risk of a baby dying between birth and one year of age) is 2 per 1000 live births in Iceland and over 120 per 1000 live births in Mozambique;the lifetime risk of maternal death during or shortly after pregnancy is only 1 in 17 400 in Sweden but it is 1 in 8 in Afghanistan.Examples of health inequities within countries:in Bolivia, babies born to women with no education have infant mortality greater than 100 per 1000 live births, while the infant mortality rate of babies born to mothers with at least secondary education is under 40 per 1000;life expectancy at birth among indigenous Australians is substantially lower (59.4 for males and 64.8 for females) than that of non-indigenous Australians (76.6 and 82.0, respectively);life expectancy at birth for men in the Calton neighbourhood of Glasgow is 54 years, 28 years less than that of men in Lenzie, a few kilometres away;the prevalence of long-term disabilities among European men aged 80+ years is 58.8% among the lower educated versus 40.2% among the higher educated."
What is meant by social gradient?,"The poorest of the poor, around the world, have the worst health. Within countries, the evidence shows that in general the lower an individual’s socioeconomic position the worse their health. There is a social gradient in health that runs from top to bottom of the socioeconomic spectrum. This is a global phenomenon, seen in low, middle and high income countries. The social gradient in health means that health inequities affect everyone.For example, if you look at under-5 mortality rates by levels of household wealth you see that within counties the relation between socioeconomic level and health is graded. The poorest have the highest under-5 mortality rates, and people in the second highest quintile of household wealth have higher mortality in their offspring than those in the highest quintile. This is the social gradient in health."
What are the social 'determinants' of health?,"The social determinants of health are the circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, work and age, and the systems put in place to deal with illness. These circumstances are in turn shaped by a wider set of forces: economics, social policies, and politics."
What are the drivers of health inequities?,"The global context affects how societies prosper through its impact on international relations and domestic norms and policies. These in turn shape the way society, both at national and local level, organizes its affairs, giving rise to forms of social position and hierarchy, whereby populations are organized according to income, education, occupation, gender, race/ethnicity and other factors. Where people are in the social hierarchy affects the conditions in which they grow, learn, live, work and age, their vulnerability to ill health and the consequences of ill health.The benefits of the economic growth that has taken place over the last 25 years are unequally distributed. In 1980 the richest countries, containing 10% of the world’s population, had gross national income 60 times that of the poorest countries, containing 10% of the world’s population. By 2005 this ratio had increased to 122.International flows of aid – grossly inadequate in themselves, and well below the levels promised – are dwarfed by the scale of many poor countries’ debt repayment obligations. The result is that, in many cases, there is a net financial outflow from poorer to richer countries – an alarming state of affairs.The trend over the last 15 years has been for the poorest quintile of the population in many countries to have a declining share in national consumption. In Kenya, for example, at current economic growth rates and with the present levels of income inequality, the median family in poverty would not cross the poverty line until 2030. Doubling the share of income growth enjoyed by Kenya’s poor would mean that reduction in poverty would happen by 2013.Gender biases in power, resources, entitlements, norms and values, and the way in which organizations are structured and programmes are run damage the health of millions of girls and women. The position of women in society is also associated with child health and survival – of boys and girls.Health equity depends vitally on the empowerment of individuals to challenge and change the unfair and steeply graded distribution of social resources to which everyone has equal claims and rights. Inequity in power interacts across four main dimensions – political, economic, social, and cultural – together constituting a continuum along which groups are, to varying degrees, excluded or included."
What is primary health care?,"As stated at Alma Ata Conference: ""Primary health care is essential health care based on practical, scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of self-reliance and self-determination."" The WHO World Health Report of 2008 will further elaborate on this definition.World Health Report 2008"
What is health equity in all policies?,"Every aspect of government and the economy has the potential to affect health and health equity – finance, education, housing, employment, transport, and health, to name just six. While health may not be the main aim of policies in these sectors, they have strong bearing on health and health equity.Policy coherence is crucial – different government departments’ policies must complement rather than contradict each other in relation to health equity. For example, trade policy that actively encourages the production, trade, and consumption of foods high in fats and sugars to the detriment of fruit and vegetable production is contradictory to health policyObesity is becoming a real public health challenge in transitioning countries, as it already is in high-income nations. Obesity prevention requires approaches that ensure a sustainable, adequate, and nutritious food supply; a habitat that lends itself to easy uptake of healthier food; participation in physical activity; and a family, educational, and work environment that positively reinforces healthy living. Very little of this action sits within the capabilities or responsibilities of the health sector. Positive advances have been made – for example, bans on advertisements for foods high in fats, sugars, and salt during television programmes aimed at children. However, a significant challenge remains: to engage with the multiple sectors outside health in areas such as trade, agriculture, employment, and education, if we are to redress the global obesity epidemic.Equity monitor"
What is smallpox?,"Smallpox is an ancient disease caused by the variola virus. Early symptoms include high fever and fatigue. The virus then produces a characteristic rash, particularly on the face, arms and legs. The resulting spots become filled with clear fluid and later, pus, and then form a crust, which eventually dries up and falls off. Smallpox was fatal in up to 30% of cases.Smallpox has existed for at least 3000 years and was one of the world’s most feared diseases until it was eradicated by a collaborative global vaccination programme led by the World Health Organization. The last known natural case was in Somalia in 1977. Since then, the only known cases were caused by a laboratory accident in 1978 in Birmingham, England, which killed one person and caused a limited outbreak. Smallpox was officially declared eradicated in 1979."
Does it occur naturally?,"Smallpox no longer occurs naturally since it was totally eradicated by a lengthy and painstaking process, which identified all cases and their contacts and ensured that they were all vaccinated. Until then, smallpox killed many millions of people."
How can I catch it and is it contagious?,"The virus which causes smallpox is contagious and spreads through person-to- person contact and saliva droplets in an infected person’s breath. It has an incubation period of between 7 and 17 days after exposure and only becomes infectious once the fever develops. A distinctive rash appears two to three days later. The most infectious period is during the first week of illness, although a person with smallpox is still infectious until the last scabs fall off."
How fast does smallpox spread?,"The speed of smallpox transmission is generally slower than for such diseases as measles or chickenpox. Patients spread smallpox primarily to household members and friends because by the time patients are contagious, they are usually sick and stay in bed; large outbreaks in schools were uncommon."
Weren't the remaining stocks of the smallpox virus destroyed after smallpox was eradicated?,"When smallpox was officially certified as eradicated, in December 1979, an agreement was reached under which all remaining stocks of the virus would either be destroyed or passed to one of two secure laboratories – one in the United States and one in the Russian Federation. That process was completed in the early 1980s and since then no other laboratory has officially had access to the virus which causes smallpox."
Then why is smallpox being talked about now?,"Some governments believe there is a risk that the virus which causes smallpox exists in places other than these laboratories and could be deliberately released to cause harm. It is impossible to assess the risk that this might happen, but at their request, WHO is making efforts to help governments prepare for this possibility."
Can it be treated?,"There is no cure for smallpox, but vaccination can be used very effectively to prevent infection from developing if given during a period of up to four days after a person has been exposed to the virus. This is the strategy that was used to eradicate the disease during the 20th century. New antiviral drugs, that have been developed for other diseases since smallpox was eradicated, may have a role. No studies of their usefulness, or safety, have been conducted on humans exposed to smallpox."
Is a vaccine currently available?,"There is a vaccine against smallpox that was a key tool in the eradication of the disease. This vaccine does not contain the variola virus which causes smallpox, but a closely related virus called vaccinia. When this vaccine is given to humans, it protects them against smallpox. However, it may have rare, but serious side effects, which in extreme cases can be fatal. Since smallpox was eradicated, the vaccine is not recommended in routine immunization. It is used to protect researchers who work on the variola virus that causes smallpox and other viruses in the same virus family (known as orthopox viruses). It could also be used to protect anyone else judged to have a high risk of exposure to smallpox. The vaccine cannot be used in people who are immune depressed or immune suppressed.After the eradication programme, a second generation of vaccines was developed that used the same smallpox vaccine strains as the vaccines used during the eradication campaign. A third generation of smallpox vaccines representing more attenuated vaccine strains, was specifically developed as safer vaccines for those high risk groups with immune disorders or dermatitis at the end of the eradication programme. However as these vaccines have not been used during the eradication campaign, the efficacy/effectiveness is not known."
Should the smallpox vaccine be widely used to protect people?,"Vaccination with the vaccinia virus as a protection against smallpox is not recommended for widespread use. No government gives or recommends the vaccine routinely since it can cause serious complications, and even death. It should be given only to those persons who have a high risk of coming into contact with the virus which causes smallpox, or who have been exposed."
What can be done to protect people from smallpox?,"Doctors, health workers and hospital personnel around the world have been trained to identify infectious diseases, verify their diagnosis and then respond accordingly. The same system would identify any possible outbreak of smallpox even if the virus is deliberately spread to cause harm. The public health system would then be mobilized to trace all known contacts of the infected person and vaccinate them to prevent more cases of smallpox from developing. If this is done rapidly and effectively, the number of cases could be kept to a minimum and the outbreak would be contained. This was the approach which successfully eradicated the disease. Key is to have a good disease detection system in place as well as a rapid response to infectious diseases, no matter what their cause. Several governments have examined the potency and levels of their smallpox vaccine stocks, and to consider whether, and under what circumstances, to obtain additional supplies."
I had the vaccination when I was a child. Am I still protected?,"Anyone who has been vaccinated against smallpox (in most countries, this means anyone aged 40 or over) will have some level of protection. The vaccination may not still be fully effective, but it is likely to protect you from the worst effects of the disease. However, if you were directly exposed to the virus which causes smallpox, a repeat vaccination would be recommended."
What is WHO doing now?,"WHO coordinates various preparedness and response activities to protect global health from any possible outbreak of smallpox. WHO receives information from governments and other sources on unusual disease outbreaks. It provides technical guidance to help countries respond to these events. WHO has displayed practical information on smallpox diagnosis, surveillance, and outbreak response on its web site. It can help countries identify potential sources of vaccine, should such a need arise."
What is a Simple/Rapid test?,"Simple/Rapid tests are designed for use where a preliminary screening test result is required and are especially useful in resource-limited countriesHigh quality, easy-to-use tests for use in resource poor settings.Tests based on agglutination, immuno-dot, immuno-chromatographic and/or immuno-filtration techniques.Quick and easy to perform – 10 minutes to 2 hours – and require little or no additional equipment.Are designed for use with individual or a limited number of samples, which make them more economical then ELISAs in low throughput laboratories.Possibility to store at room temperature for extended period of time.Same-day results provide timely treatment interventions."
What is the difference between a ELISA and a Simple/Rapid test,"ELISAs are highly sensitive and specific, and are able to detect HIV-1/ HIV-2 and variants. They require sophisticated equipment that must be regularly maintained, a constant electricity supply and skilled technicians. They are really not suitable for small laboratories, but for testing large numbers of samples per day, as well as in blood banks or for surveillance studies. The Simple/Rapid tests are better for emergency testing, and in smaller laboratories with low numbers of tests per day."
Should tetanus immunizations be given to survivors with injuries in emergency situations?,"In emergency situations where there are serious injuries, tetanus immunization has to be taken into consideration.As tetanus is a complication of wounds and injuries, it is essential that injured people receive appropriate surgical and medical care of contaminated open wounds. Open wounds must be considered as contaminated and should not be closed. Debridement and removal of dead tissue and debris is essential, and depending on the size of the wound may necessitate a surgical procedure undertaken in appropriate conditions. Wounds should be dressed with sterile dressings and the patient scheduled for delayed primary closure.Tetanus immunization is usually provided to victims of natural disasters on an as-needed basis for several reasons.Types of tetanus vaccinesTT - Tetanus Toxoid vaccineDTP - Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis vaccineDT - Diphtheria toxoid and Tetanus toxoid vaccineTd - Tetanus toxoid and Diphtheria toxoid vaccine (low dose diphtheria)First, it is not communicable from person-to-person.Second, in many parts of the world, most people have already some protection against tetanus through immunization.In summary, tetanus prevention can be achieved during emergencies through:Careful cleaning of wounds, both deep and superficial, can substantially decrease the risk of tetanus. Protecting cleaned wounds from recontamination with dressings, and/or topical disinfectants also is important.Protective clothing and closed shoes, if available, should be worn by anyone engaged in clearing away or sifting through debris.If possible, TT vaccination should be offered to anyone engaged in debris clean-up and construction. For those who have not received TT in the past, or for whom past vaccination is uncertain, a second dose should be administered 4-8 weeks after the first. The first dose will not provide protection to those who have not previously been vaccinated, but will rather prime the body to produce anti-tetanus immunity with the second dose given at-least 4 weeks later.If feasible, vaccination with TT-containing vaccine should be offered to all internally displaced people who have not received at least 3 previous doses.Because tetanus risk is high in disaster areas, and because the immunization status of most persons will be unknown, it will be worthwhile to provide doses of TT-containing vaccine, even if only one dose can be assured.Tetanus immunoglobulins may be required for managing those with deep wounds.In emergencies where prior tetanus toxoid immunization levels were low, special attention should be given to preventing maternal and neonatal tetanus, by immunizing women of childbearing age and by improving the hygienic conditions under which childbirths take place. Routine immunization of women and children should also be re-established as soon as possible."
"Q: We know that the same mosquito species can carry many diseases (such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever). Can a mosquito carry more than one disease at the same time? If so, could someone get more than one disease from a single bite?","The mosquito species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus carry dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus. In addition, Aedes aegypti also transmits yellow fever.Studies done in Gabon and India show that humans can be infected with chikungunya and dengue at the same time.Entomological studies confirming coinfection in mosquitoes are rare. The Gabon study found one mosquito specimen that was positive for both viruses, meaning that it is possible that the bite of a single mosquito could infect a person with 2 viruses at the same time.Coinfection poses a challenge for accurate diagnosis and treatment, particularly when symptoms such as fever and aches can be similar for many diseases."
What is the SDG Health Price Tag?,"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Health Price Tag is a 
model that estimates the financial investments needed to strengthen 
health systems in order to reach the health targets in the Sustainable 
Development Goals by 2030.The WHO SDG Heath Price Tag is a ballpark estimate, and is not
 prescriptive for what countries should spend. It shows the areas in 
which major investments are needed, and forecasts the extent to which 
different countries can afford them."
What are the main findings?,"The SDG Health Price Tag models two scenarios: an ""ambitious"" 
scenario in which countries reach the health targets in the SDGs by 
2030, and a “progress” scenario in which countries get two thirds or 
more of the way to the targets.In both scenarios, health systems investments such as 
employing more health workers; building and operating new clinics, 
hospitals and laboratories; and buying medical equipment account for 
about 75% of the total cost. The remainder is for medicines, vaccines, 
syringes and other commodities used to prevent or treat specific 
diseases, and for activities such as training, health campaigns and 
outreach to vulnerable communities.Under the ""ambitious"" scenario, achieving the SDG health 
targets would require new investments increasing over time from an 
initial US$ 134 billion annually to $371 billion, or $58 per person, by 
2030.The model includes adding more than 23 million health workers,
 and building more than 415 000 new health facilities, 91% of which 
would be primary health care centres.The investments could prevent 97 million premature deaths – 
one every five seconds over 15 years – including more than 50 million 
infants and children who are either stillborn or die before their fifth 
birthday, and 20 million deaths from noncommunicable diseases such as 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Life expectancy would 
increase by between 3.1 and 8.4 years, and 535 million years of healthy 
living would be added across the 67 countries.The ""progress"" scenario would require new investments 
increasing from an initial US$ 104 billion a year to $274 billion, or 
$41 per person, by 2030. These investments would prevent about 71 
million premature deaths, add more than 14 million new health workers, 
and nearly 378 000 new health facilities, 93% of which would be primary 
health care centres."
Can countries afford it?,"Yes, most can. WHO analysis shows that 85% of the costs can be
 met with domestic resources, although as many as 32 of the world’s 
poorest countries will face an annual gap of up to US$ 54 billion and 
will continue to need external assistance.Investments made under the ambitious scenario would boost 
health spending as a proportion of gross domestic product across all 67 
countries from an average of 5.6% to 7.5%. The progress scenario would 
boost health spending as a proportion of GDP to an average of 6.5%. The 
global average for health spending as a proportion of GDP is 9.9%. 
Although higher spending does not necessarily translate to improved 
health, making the right investments at the right time can.WHO encourages countries to set nationally appropriate 
spending targets for quality investments in essential public services in
 the health sector as well as other social sectors, consistent with 
national sustainable development strategies.Governments can generate more public revenue by broadening the
 tax base, increasing the efficiency of tax collection, and reducing 
corruption and international tax avoidance. Parallel to this, 
governments should also ensure that an appropriate share of public 
revenue is allocated to health.However, it’s not only how much is spent but how
 it’s spent. At the same level of spending, WHO observes a significant 
variance in health system performance across countries due to differing 
levels of efficiency."
How were these estimates produced?,"WHO analysed existing databases to assess country data on 
disease burden, health service coverage, and health system performance. 
We grouped countries into five categories in terms of their health 
systems and financial capacity.We considered how health services could be scaled up through 
four categories of health service delivery from policy and community 
interventions like taxes and regulations up to hospital services. Next, 
we identified what investments are needed to bring countries towards 
global benchmarks in terms of health system performance targets, health 
service coverage, and overall health outcomes. These activities and 
investments are modelled by country and by year, and multiplied by 
country-specific prices. Investments are modelled to increase over time.
 The majority of the analysis was done in the OneHealth Tool, a software
 application whose development is overseen by WHO and other UN agencies."
What is not included in your estimates? What is missing?,"For some areas there is a lack of good data and projection 
models, such as injury prevention, road traffic accidents, chemical 
poisoning, and hepatitis, so we have not included them in the analysis.Interventions were also excluded for which current coverage 
levels could not be identified and/or there is limited agreement on what
 target levels to strive for (such as for oral health, assistive 
technologies, and consumables like gloves and laboratory reagents).The costs of research and development were not included. While
 technological innovation will be important to enable us to deliver 
services more efficiently in the future, there is considerable 
uncertainty around the size of future gains and when those will happen. 
Moreover, while future technologies may be more cost-effective, they 
also may be more expensive and require additional resources than what we
 have modelled. Given the uncertainty, we did not attempt to model a 
forecasted change in technology whereby more effective technologies are 
implemented than what is available today.For all of the reasons above, these estimates should be 
considered as minimum indicative estimates. WHO plans to update the 
model with more data as it becomes available."
Why did you only include 67 countries?,"WHO decided to include all low-income countries, the 20 
most-populous lower-middle-income countries, and the 20 most populous 
upper-middle-income countries. Some countries were excluded from the 
final dataset because they did not have the required data available for 
GDP projections, and other countries changed income category 
classification during the course of the analysis, such that in the end 
there were 28 low-income countries and 39 middle-income countries.These jointly account for 95% of the population in low- and 
middle-income countries, and 75% of the global population. Notably, 
Russia is not included because it was classified as a high-income 
country when we started our work, although it has since been 
reclassified as a middle-income country.High income countries are not included to allow focus on those
 countries that face the greatest challenges in increasing service 
provision and resource mobilization to progress towards the SDG health 
targets."
So what should my country spend on health?,"We have not published a breakdown of costs by country, because
 the purpose of the SDG Health Price Tag is to give a global overview of
 the types of investments needed to strengthen health systems, rather 
than a prescription for what individual countries should spend.Countries can request assistance from WHO to set priorities 
and estimate resource needs through the WHO-CHOICE programme of work and
 the OneHealth Tool, which would closely replicate the methods used in 
this study."
Can you guarantee that the SDG health targets will be reached if countries meet these spending levels?,"No. Achieving the SDG health targets is not simply a matter of
spending money. Political commitment to pursuing the targets is vital,
as is respect for human rights. Making wise investments in health
system, coupled with stronger institutions are likely to bring about the
wanted changes."
What is the SCORE for Health Data Technical Package?,"SCORE (Survey, Count, Optimize, Review, Enable) for Health Data Technical Package addresses WHO’s commitment in the Thirteenth General Programme of Work to support Member States in the effective collection, analysis, reporting and use of health data to achieve health-related SDGs.SCORE is a one-stop solution to address common challenges around availability of timely, reliable, validated, and comparable health data raised by the WHO World Health Statistics 2020 Report and UN Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020 and highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic.SCORE is not intended to replace existing guidance on implementing various components of a health information system. Rather, it provides a harmonized package of the most effective interventions needed to address critical gaps and strengthen country health data for planning and monitoring of national and subnational health priorities."
What comprises the SCORE for Health Data Technical Package?,"The SCORE for Health Data Technical Package includes the Essential Interventions document, Tools & Standards document, and Assessment Instrument.

What is schistosomiasis or bilharzia?,Schistosomiasis is an acute and chronic disease caused by parasitic worms. It is transmitted when larval forms released by freshwater snails penetrate human skin during contact with infested water.
In which regions is the disease mostly found?,Schistosomiasis is prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. It is more prevalent in poor communities without access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. It is estimated that at least 90% of those requiring treatment for schistosomiasis live in Africa.
How does one get infected?,"Bilharzia is transmitted when people suffering from schistosomiasis contaminate freshwater sources with their excreta containing parasite eggs, which hatch in water. In the body, the larvae develop into adult worms. These worms live in the blood vessels where the females release eggs. Some of the eggs are passed out of the body in the faeces or urine to continue the parasite’s life cycle. Others become trapped in body tissues, causing immune reactions and progressive damage to organs."
What are the forms of the disease?,"There are two major forms of schistosomiasis: intestinal and urogenital. Both forms affect mainly poor and rural communities, particularly agricultural and fishing populations."
What are the symptoms of intestinal schistosomiasis?,"Intestinal schistosomiasis can cause abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and blood in the stool. Liver enlargement is common in advanced cases and is frequently associated with an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity and hypertension of the abdominal blood vessels. In such cases there may also be enlargement of the spleen."
What are the symptoms of urogenital schistosomiasis?,"The classic sign is presence of blood in urine (haematuria). Fibrosis of the bladder and ureter, and kidney damage are sometimes diagnosed in advanced cases. Bladder cancer is another possible complication in the later stages. In women, urogenital schistosomiasis may present with genital lesions, vaginal bleeding, pain during sexual intercourse, and nodules in the vulva. In men, urogenital schistosomiasis can induce pathology of the seminal vesicles, prostate, and other organs."
Is the disease more complicated in women?,"Women doing domestic chores in infested water, such as washing clothes in areas endemic for the disease, are greatly at risk. Women can also develop female genital schistosomiasis – which can cause genital lesions, vaginal bleeding, pain during sexual intercourse, and nodules in the vulva. Female genital schistosomiasis is also considered to be a risk factor for HIV infection, especially in women."
How do children get exposed and how can the disease affect them?,Lack of hygiene and certain play habits of school-aged children such as swimming or fishing in infested water make them especially vulnerable to infection. Schistosomiasis can also cause anaemia and stunting and a reduced ability to learn among children.
Can schistosomiasis be treated?,"All forms of schistosomiasis can be treated effectively by the WHO-recommended medicine praziquantel. It is effective, safe, and low-cost. Even though re-infection may occur after treatment, the risk of developing severe disease is diminished and even reversed when treatment is initiated and repeated in childhood. As part of its global strategy to control the disease, WHO focuses on reducing the disease through periodic, targeted treatment with praziquantel through the large-scale treatment (preventive chemotherapy) of affected populations. This involves regular treatment of all at-risk groups."
Can pregnant women be treated with praziquantel?,"Praziquantel is extremely safe and WHO recommends that pregnant women infected with the disease should be treated. But as a general precaution, WHO recommends treatment should be taken after the first trimester."
Should tourists be concerned when traveling to countries that have schistosomiasis?,"Tourists can easily avoid infection
by not swimming in fresh water in areas where schistosomiasis is likely to
occur. Even if infected, the worms do not cause a life-threatening disease for
someone who is generally healthy. The disease is only serious for people living
in endemic areas who become constantly re-infected and have no access
treatment. If infected, treatment with praziquantel is easy, efficacious and
safe."
Why are so many children involved in road traffic crashes?,"Children are at risk for road traffic injuries for a number of 
reasons. Younger children are limited by their physical, cognitive and 
social development, making them more vulnerable in road traffic than 
adults. Because of their small stature, it can be difficult for children
 to see surrounding traffic and for drivers and others to see them. In 
addition if they are involved in a road traffic crash, their softer 
heads make them more susceptible to serious head injury than adults. 
		Younger children may have difficulties interpreting various 
sights and sounds, which may impact on their judgement regarding the 
proximity, speed and direction of moving vehicles. Younger children may 
also be impulsive, and their short attention spans mean that they 
struggle to cope with more than one challenge at a time. As they grow 
older, children of adolescent age are especially prone to take risks, 
compromising their safety on the road. In general roads are planned 
without sufficient consideration of the specific needs of children. Globally, around 186 300 children under 18 years die from road
 traffic crashes annually, and road traffic injuries are the leading 
killer of children aged 15-17 years worldwide. Two times as many boys as
 girls die in road traffic crashes. In addition, rates of road traffic 
death among children are 3 times higher in low- and middle-income 
countries than in high-income countries. Road traffic injuries can be prevented. While no single 
measure adequately addresses the vast range of risks to children on the 
road, the ten strategies below are those which are best known - 
especially when implemented as a package - to keep children safe on the 
road. Controlling speedReducing drinking and drivingUsing helmets for bicyclists and motorcyclistsRestraining children in vehiclesImproving children's ability to see and be seenEnhancing road infrastructureAdapting vehicle designImplementing graduated driver licensingThese are discussed in detail in a new document called ""Ten strategies for keeping children safe on the road” published by WHO on the occasion of the Third United Nations Global Road Safety Week (4–10 May 2015).

What are the common health problems of refugees and migrants arriving in the European Region?,"The health problems of refugees and migrants are similar to 
those of the rest of the population, although some groups may have a 
higher prevalence. The most frequent health problems of newly arrived 
migrants include accidental injuries, hypothermia, burns, cardiovascular
 events, pregnancy and delivery-related complications, diabetes and 
hypertension. Female migrants frequently face specific challenges, 
particularly in maternal, newborn and child health, sexual and 
reproductive health, and violence. 
		The exposure of migrants to the risks associated with 
population movements – psychosocial disorders, reproductive health 
problems, higher newborn mortality, drug abuse, nutrition disorders, 
alcoholism and exposure to violence – increase their vulnerability to 
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The key issue with regard to NCDs is 
the interruption of care, due either to lack of access or to the 
decimation of health care systems and providers; displacement results in
 interruption of the continuous treatment that is crucial for chronic 
conditions. Vulnerable children are prone to acute infections such as 
respiratory infections and diarrhoea because of poor living conditions 
and deprivation during migration, and they require access to acute care.
 Lack of hygiene can lead to skin infections. Furthermore, the number of
 casualties and deaths among refugees and migrants crossing the 
Mediterranean Sea has increased rapidly, with a reported 1867 people 
drowned or missing at sea in the first 6 months of 2015, according to 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)."
What are the WHO recommendations for triage and screening of migrants upon arrival?,"WHO does not recommend obligatory screening of refugee and 
migrant populations for diseases, because there is no clear evidence of 
benefits (or cost-effectiveness); furthermore, it can trigger anxiety in
 individual refugees and the wider community. 
		WHO strongly recommends offering and providing health checks 
to ensure access to health care for all refugees and migrants in need of
 health protection. Health checks should be done for both communicable 
and NCDs, with respect for migrants' human rights and dignity.The results of screening must never be used as a reason or justification for ejecting a refugee or a migrant from a country.Obligatory screening deters migrants from asking for a medical check-up and jeopardizes identification of high-risk patients.In spite of the common perception that there is an association 
between migration and the importation of infectious diseases, there is 
no systematic association. Refugees and migrants are exposed mainly to 
the infectious diseases that are common in Europe, independently of 
migration. The risk that exotic infectious agents, such as Ebola virus, 
will be imported into Europe is extremely low, and when it occurs, 
experience shows that it affects regular travellers, tourists or health 
care workers rather than refugees or migrants.Triage is recommended at points of entry to identify health 
problems in refugees and migrants soon after their arrival. Proper 
diagnosis and treatment must follow, and the necessary health care must 
be ensured for specific population groups (children, pregnant women, 
elderly). Each and every person on the move must have full access to a 
hospitable environment, to prevention (e.g. vaccination) and, when 
needed, to high-quality health care, without discrimination on the basis
 of gender, age, religion, nationality or race. This is the safest way 
to ensure that the resident population is not unnecessarily exposed to 
imported infectious agents. WHO supports policies to provide health care
 services to migrants and refugees irrespective of their legal status as
 part of universal health coverage."
What does WHO recommend with regard to vaccination for newly arrived migrants?,"Transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases to host country 
populations is just as likely to happen after the return of a resident 
of that country from a holiday in an endemic country as after the 
arrival of a migrant from the country. There are still large gaps in the
 immunity of populations across the Region, either because countries 
decide not to avail themselves of the benefits of vaccination or because
 of limited access to vaccination services.
		The WHO Regional Office for Europe does not routinely collect 
information on transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases among 
migrants or on their immunization coverage. However, well-documented 
outbreaks of measles have originated by transmission from migrants, 
mobile populations, international travellers and tourists alike. Equitable access to vaccination is of prime importance and is 
one of the objectives of the European Vaccine Action Plan 2015–2020. The
 plan proposes that all countries in the Region pay special attention to
 ensuring the eligibility and access of migrants, international 
travellers and marginalized communities to (culturally) appropriate 
vaccination services and information. We applaud the many countries, 
such as those receiving large influxes of migrants, that are including 
migrants into their routine vaccination programmes. More on immunization coverage of all countries"
What health care access does WHO recommend for refugees and migrants?,"Legal status is one of the most important determinants of the 
access of migrants to health services in a country. Each and every 
refugee and migrant must have full, uninterrupted access to a hospitable
 environment and, when needed, to high-quality health care, without 
discrimination on the basis of gender, age, religion, nationality or 
race. WHO supports policies to provide health care services irrespective
 of migrants' legal status. As rapid access to health care can result in
 cure, it can avoid the spread of diseases; it is therefore in the 
interest of both migrants and the receiving country, to ensure that the 
resident population is not unnecessarily exposed to the importation of 
infectious agents. Likewise, diagnosis and treatment of NCDs such as 
diabetes and hypertension can prevent these conditions from worsening 
and becoming life-threatening."
What is WHO doing to address the public health implications of the large influxes of refugees and migrants into the European Region?,"WHO works to: 
develop migrant-sensitive health policies; strengthen health systems to provide equitable access to services;establish information systems to assess migrant health; share information on best practices; increase the cultural and gender sensitivity and specific training of health service providers and professionals; and promote multilateral cooperation among countries in 
accordance with resolution WHA61.17 on the health of migrants endorsed 
by the Sixty-first World Health Assembly in 2008.WHO has been working on the health issues related to people's 
movements for many years. The WHO European health policy framework 
Health 2020 has drawn particular attention to migration and health, with
 population vulnerability and human rights. Following the political, 
economic and humanitarian crises in the north of Africa and the Middle 
East, WHO, in collaboration with the Italian Ministry of Health, 
established the Public Health Aspects of Migration in Europe project in 
April 2012. The aims are: to strengthen health system capacity to meet the health needs of mixed inflows of migrants and host populations; promote immediate health interventions; ensure migrant-sensitive health policies; improve the quality of the health services delivered; and optimize use of health structures and resources in countries receiving migrant populations. Up to August 2015, the Regional Office had conducted joint 
assessment missions with ministries of health in Bulgaria, Cyprus, 
Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Serbia and Spain, with the new ""Toolkit 
for assessing health system capacity to manage large influxes of 
migrants in the acute phase,"" to respond to and address the complex, 
resource-intensive, multisectoral, politically sensitive issues in 
health and migration."
What is genital schistosomiasis?,"Schistosoma haematobium is the main species causing genital manifestations but other species of schistosomiasis have been implicated. The number of people suffering from genital manifestations is not precisely known. The biological plausibility of a causal association between genital schistosomiasis and HIV has been described, and may be an important factor in increasing the risk of contracting HIV in areas or communities where both infections are coendemic."
What are the clinical manifestations?,"The clinical manifestations of genital schistosomiasis occur both in women and in men.In men, the symptoms include epididymitis (an inflammation of the eipdidymis at the back of the testicle) which can simulate tuberculosis and associated funiculitis, indolence and possible fistulization, hemospermia, pain during urination prostatitis and others.In women, the symptomatology is unspecific because urogenital schistosomiasis can provoke gynaecological ailments. The most frequently observed signs and symptoms are abdominal and pelvic pain presenting in forms such as dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, leucorrhoea, menstrual disorders, post-coital bleeding or simple contact bleeding (during an examination), cervicitis, endometritis and salpingitis. The disease evolves most often in a chronic manner. These genital lesions can cause complications such as early abortion, ectopic pregnancy and infertility.The clinical appearance of genital lesions is variable."
How is it diagnosed?,"Genital schistosomiasis may be associated with the presence of schistosome eggs (ova) in the genitals in both men and women. However, ova are not always concurrently present, and current laboratory methods have a low sensitivity to confirm their presence.
    Lesions associated with genital schistosomiasis may mimic a host of infections and premalignant or malignant conditions. It is therefore crucial to identify alterations that are pathognomic. Differential diagnosis must be done systematically to screen
    for cancers (of the vulva, vagina, cervix, endometrium), sexually transmitted infections and urogenital tuberculosis.Clinical diagnosis of female genital schistosomiasis is mainly done by visual inspection and histological methods.The WHO Female Genital Schistosomiasis Pocket Atlas and related Clinical Poster are visual aides that have been developed for clinical health-care professionals
    to raise the clinical index of suspicion and facilitate identification of these lesions, especially in low-resource settings."
How is genital schistosomiasis treated?,"Treatment with praziquantel kills the adult worms and provides relief and regression of inflammatory lesions. Few studies reported that praziquantel has no effect on established grainy lesions. However, elimination of adult worms prevents further egg deposition in the tissues and thus development of new lesions. Early treatment, especially in childhood, is the most effective intervention to prevent the occurrence and development of complications associated with urogenital schistosomiasis.The widespread lack of awareness of genital schistosomiasis leads to misdiagnosis and, therefore, false and ineffective therapy . As female genital schistosomiasis is rarely diagnosed correctly, knowledge about the effect of treatment is also scanty. Incorrect diagnostic of genital schistosomiasis lesions frequently leads to debilitating and irreversible operations such as ovarectomy, salpingotomiy and hysterectomy. It is therefore of utmost importance to sensitize health workers and raise awareness of urogenital schistosomiasis, particularly in endemic countries."
How can genital schistosomiasis be prevented?,"Regular treatment with praziquantel from an early age prevents schistosomiasis from progressing to genital damage and other related complications. In endemic areas, WHO recommends regular large-scale administration of preventive chemotherapy to entire communities or routinely in health facilities.The public health advantages of anthelminthic treatment with praziquantel go beyond the simple benefits of curing schistosomiasis and preventing its related genital morbidity. Regardless of the presumptive causal association with HIV infection, urogenital schistosomiasis is a disabling disease by itself, and it should be prevented with the currently available means. The WHO recommended policy of regularly treating school-age children with praziquantel should be reinforced and extended, to involve collaborations with programmes for preventing HIV and other sexually transmitted infections."
What are the different types of skin cancer?,"Non-melanoma skin cancersNon-melanoma skin cancers comprise basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. These are rarely lethal but surgical treatment is painful and often disfiguring. The temporal trends of the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers are difficult to determine, because reliable registration of these cancers has not been achieved. However, specific studies carried out in Australia, Canada and the United States, indicate that between the 1960s and the 1980s the prevalence of non-melanoma skin cancers increased by a factor of more than two.The risk of non-melanoma skin cancers has been examined with respect to personal exposure, and the following conclusions can be drawn:Non-melanoma skin cancers are most frequent on parts of the body that are commonly exposed to the sun such as ears, face, neck and forearms. This implies that long-term, repeated UV radiation exposure is a major causal factor.Within some countries there is a clear relationship between increasing incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers with decreasing latitude, i.e. higher UV radiation levels.Malignant melanomaMalignant melanoma, although far less prevalent than non-melanoma skin cancers, is the major cause of death from skin cancer and is more likely to be reported and accurately diagnosed than non-melanoma skin cancers. Since the early 1970s, malignant melanoma incidence has increased significantly, for example an average 4 per cent every year in the United States. A large number of studies indicate that the risk of malignant melanoma correlates with genetic and personal characteristics, and a person’s UV exposure behaviour. The following is a summary of the main human risk factors:A large number of atypical nevi (moles) is the strongest risk factor for malignant melanoma in fair-skinned populations.Malignant melanoma is more common among people with a pale complexion, blue eyes, and red or fair hair. Experimental studies have demonstrated a lower minimum erythema dose and more prolonged erythema in melanoma patients than in controls.High, intermittent exposure to solar UV appears to be a significant risk factor for the development of malignant melanoma.The incidence of malignant melanoma in white populations generally increases with decreasing latitude, with the highest recorded incidence occurring in Australia, where the annual rates are 10 and over 20 times the rates in Europe for women and men respectively.Several epidemiological studies support a positive association with history of sunburn, particularly sunburn at an early age.The role of cumulative sun exposure in the development of malignant melanoma is equivocal. However, malignant melanoma risk is higher in people with a history of non-melanoma skin cancers and of solar keratoses, both of which are indicators of cumulative UV exposure."
How common is skin cancer?,"The incidence of both non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers has been increasing over the past decades. Currently, between 2 and 3 million non-melanoma skin cancers and 132,000 melanoma skin cancers occur globally each year. One in every three cancers diagnosed is a skin cancer and, according to Skin Cancer Foundation Statistics, one in every five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime.As ozone levels are depleted, the atmosphere loses more and more of its protective filter function and more solar UV radiation reaches the Earth's surface. It is estimated that a 10 per cent decrease in ozone levels will result in an additional 300,000 non-melanoma and 4,500 melanoma skin cancer cases. The global incidence of melanoma continues to increase – however, the main factors that predispose to the development of melanoma seem to be connected with recreational exposure to the sun and a history of sunburn. These factors lie within each individual's own responsibility."
Who is most at risk of getting skin cancer?,"Due to their relative lack of skin pigmentation Caucasian populations generally have a much higher risk of getting non-melanoma or melanoma skin cancers than dark-skinned populations. Naturally brown and black people (skin types V, VI – see table)
    can usually safely tolerate relatively high levels of sun exposure without getting sunburnt or greatly increasing their skin cancer risk. In contrast, people with pale or freckled skin, fair or red hair and blue eyes belong to the highest risk group
    (skin types I, II); people with dark hair and eyes who do not normally get sunburnt are at medium risk of developing skin cancer (skin types III, IV). Nevertheless excessive exposure to intense sunlight can damage all skin types - the risk of eye

What is UV?,"Everyone is exposed to UV radiation from the sun and an increasing
 number of people are exposed to artificial sources used in industry, 
commerce and recreation. The sun is by far the strongest source of ultraviolet radiation in our environment. Solar emissions include visible light, heat and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Just as visible light consists of different colours that become apparent in a rainbow, the UV radiation spectrum is divided into three regions called UVA, UVB and UVC. As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, all UVC and most UVB is absorbed by ozone, water vapour, oxygen and carbon dioxide. UVA is not filtered as significantly by the atmosphere."
Is there a connection between ozone depletion and UV radiation?,"Ozone is a particularly effective absorber of UV radiation. As the ozone layer gets thinner, the protective filter activity of the atmosphere is progressively reduced. Consequently, the people and the environment are exposed to higher levels of UV radiation, especially UVB.Ozone depletion is caused by human-made chemicals released into the atmosphere and will continue until the use of chlorine and bromine compounds is drastically reduced. International agreements, in particular the Montreal Protocol, are gradually succeeding in phasing out the production of ozone-depleting substances. However, the long life span of the chemicals already released will cause ozone depletion problems to persist for many years to come. A full recovery of the ozone level is not expected until 2050.The incidence of different types of skin cancer has been growing dramatically over the past decades. Some people claim that this is due to ozone depletion and enhanced levels of UV. However, most evidence now suggests that the major cause for the increased cancer rates is altered behaviour rather than ozone depletion. More outdoor activities and altered sunbathing habits often result in excessive UV exposure. Raised awareness and changes in life-style are urgently needed to alter ongoing trends."
"What is the difference between UVA, UVB and UVC?","The three types of UV radiation are classified according to their wavelength. They differ in their biological activity and the extent to which they can penetrate the skin. The shorter the wavelength, the more harmful the UV radiation. However, shorter wavelength UV radiation is less able to penetrate the skin.The UV region covers the wavelength range 100-400 nm and is divided into three bands:UVA (315-400 nm)UVB (280-315 nm)UVC (100-280 nm).Short-wavelength UVC is the most damaging type of UV radiation. However, it is completely filtered by the atmosphere and does not reach the earth's surface.Medium-wavelength UVB is very biologically active but cannot penetrate beyond the superficial skin layers. It is responsible for delayed tanning and burning; in addition to these short-term effects it enhances skin ageing and significantly promotes the development of skin cancer. Most solar UVB is filtered by the atmosphere.The relatively long-wavelength UVA accounts for approximately 95 per cent of the UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface. It can penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin and is responsible for the immediate tanning effect. Furthermore, it also contributes to skin ageing and wrinkling. For a long time it was thought that UVA could not cause any lasting damage. Recent studies strongly suggest that it may also enhance the development of skin cancers."
Which environmental factors affect a person's UV exposure?,"Time of year and time of dayUV levels vary mainly with the height of the sun in the sky and in mid-latitudes are highest during the summer months during the 4-hour period around solar noon. During these times the sun's rays take the most direct path to earth. In contrast, during early morning or late afternoon hours the sun's rays pass at a greater angle through the atmosphere. Much more UV radiation is absorbed and less reaches the Earth.LatitudeUV levels are higher closer to the equator. Closer to the equator the sun's rays have a shorter distance to travel through the atmosphere and therefore less of the harmful UV radiation can be absorbed.AltitudeWith increasing altitude less atmosphere is available to absorb UV radiation. With every 1000 m in altitude, UV levels increase by approximately 10 per cent.Clouds and hazeBe careful not to underestimate the amount of UV radiation passing through clouds.Many surfaces reflect UV radiation and add to the overall UV levels you experience. While grass, soil or water reflect less than 10 per cent of incident UV radiation, sand reflects about 15 per cent, and sea foam about 25 per cent. Fresh snow is a particularly good reflector and almost doubles a person's UV exposure. Recurring incidences of snow blindness or photokeratitis in skiers emphasize that UV protective measures must take ground reflection into account.UV levels are highest under cloudless skies, and cloud cover generally reduces a person's exposure. However, light or thin clouds have little effect and may even enhance UV levels because of scattering. Don't be fooled by an overcast day or a cool breeze! Even a long stay in open shade, for example between buildings, may give a sensitive person a sunburn on a day with high UV levels.OzoneOzone absorbs some of the UV radiation that would otherwise 
reach the Earth’s surface. Ozone levels vary over the year and even 
across the day.Ground reflectionUV radiation is reflected or scattered to 
varying extents by different surfaces, e.g. snow can reflect as much as 
80% of UV radiation, dry beach sand about 15%, and sea foam about 25%."
What is the UV index?,"The UVI is a measure of the level of UV radiation.The values of the index range from zero upward - the higher the UVI, the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eye, and the less time it takes for harm to occur.The UVI is an important vehicle to alert people about the need to use sun protection.A marked increase in the incidence of skin cancer in fair-skinned populations worldwide is strongly associated with excessive UV radiation exposure from the sun and possibly artificial sources such as sunbeds. Current evidence indicates that personal habits in relation to sun exposure constitute the most important individual risk factor for UV radiation damage.The UV Index is an important vehicle to raise public awareness of the risks of excessive exposure to UV radiation, and to alert people about the need to adopt protective measures. As part of an international effort, the UV index was developed by WHO, the United Nations Environment Programme, and the World Meteorological Organization. Encouraging people to reduce their sun exposure can decrease harmful health effects and significantly reduce health care costs.The INTERSUN programme promotes the harmonized use of the UVI, and advises governments to employ this educational tool in their health promotion programmes. WHO encourages dissemination channels such as the media and tourism industry to publish the UVI forecast and promote sun protection messages."
What does the UV index mean?,"The levels of UV radiation and therefore the values of the index vary throughout the day. In reporting the UVI, most emphasis is placed on the maximum UV level on a given day. This occurs during the four-hour period around solar noon. Depending on geographical location and whether daylight saving time is applied, solar noon takes place between noon and 2 p.m. The media usually present a forecast of the maximum UV level for the following day."
How can the UV index help me to protect myself?,"The UVI gives an indication of the level of UV radiation and the potential danger of sun exposure. It can help individuals make healthy choices.Most people are used to adjusting their daily plans and choice of clothing to the weather forecast, especially to temperature predictions. Analogous to the temperature scale, the UVI gives an indication of the level of UV radiation and the potential danger
    of sun exposure. It can help individuals make healthy choices.Step 1: Find out today’s UV IndexStep 2: Check out the recommended sun protection.UV index Action0 to 2You can safely enjoy being outside!3 to 7Seek shade during midday hours!

Shirt, sunscreen and hat are a must!Even for very sensitive fair-skinned people, the risk of short-term and long-term UV damage below a UVI of 2 is limited, and under normal circumstances no protective measures are needed. If sun protection is required, this should include all protective
    means, i.e. clothing and sunglasses, shade and sunscreen.Where is the UV index reported?In many countries the UVI is reported along with the weather forecast in newspapers, on TV and on the radio; however, this is usually only done during the summer months.UV Index reporting for a range of countries and in many different languages."

What are the values HIA is based on?,"HIA is based on four values that link the HIA to the policy environment in which it is being undertaken.Democracy – allowing people to participate in the development and implementation of policies, programmes or projects that may impact on their lives.Equity – HIA assesses the distribution of impacts from a proposal on the whole population, with a particular reference to how the proposal will affect vulnerable people (in terms of age, gender, ethnic background and socio-economic status).Sustainable development – that both short and long term impacts are considered, along with the obvious, and less obvious impacts.Ethical use of evidence – the best available quantitative and qualitative evidence must be identified and used in the assessment. A wide variety of evidence should be collected using the best possible methods."
What are the reasons for using HIA?,"Promotes cross-sectoral workingThe health and well-being of people is determined by a wide range of economic, social and environmental influences. Activities in many sectors beyond the health sector influence these determinants of health. HIA is a participatory approach that helps people from multiple sectors to work together. HIA participants consider the impacts of the proposed action on their individual sector, and other sectors – and the potential impact on health from any change. Overlaps with other policy and project initiatives are often identified, providing a more integrated approach to policy making. ""Joined up thinking"" and ""cross-sectoral working"" are phrases that apply to the HIA way of working.A participatory approach that values the views of the communityAn initial stage within the HIA process is to identify the relevant stakeholders. This process usually produces a large number of relevant people, groups and organizations. The HIA can be used as a framework to implicate stakeholders in a meaningful way, allowing their messages to be heard.Stakeholders commonly include:The local community/public, particularly vulnerable groupsDevelopersPlannersLocal/national governmentsVoluntary agencies, nongovernmental organizationsHealth workers at local, national or international levelsEmployers and unionsRepresentatives of other sectors affected by the proposalThe commissioner(s) of the HIAThe decision-makersThe network of people and organisations who will carry out the HIA.HIA provides a way to engage with members of the public affected by a particular proposal. An HIA can send a signal that an organization or partnership wants to involve a community and is willing to respond constructively to their concerns. Because the HIA process values many different types of evidence during the assessment of a proposal, the views of the public can be considered alongside expert opinion and scientific data, with each source of information being valued equally within the HIA. It is important to note that the decision makers may value certain types of evidence more than others, and community expectations must be managed to avoid ‘over-promising what an HIA can deliver. An HIA does not make decisions; it provides information in a clear and transparent way for decision makers’.The best available evidence is provided to decision-makersThe purpose of an HIA is to provide decision-makers with a set of evidence-based recommendations about the proposal. The decision-makers can then decide to accept, reject or amend the proposal, in the knowledge that they have the best available evidence before them. Evidence used in an HIA can be both qualitative and quantitative, and each is valuable. HIA should consider a range of different types of evidence – going beyond published reviews and research papers, to include the views and opinions of key players who are involved or affected by a proposal. Often, information of the quality and quantity demanded by decision-makers cannot be found, a note of this is made within the HIA and the best available evidence is provided.Improves health and reduces inequalitiesAddressing inequalities and improving health is a goal for many organisations and all governments. One way of contributing to the health and inequalities agenda is through the use of HIA. At the very least, HIA ensures that proposals do not inadvertently damage health or reinforce inequalities. HIA uses a wide model of health and works across sectors to provide a systematic approach for assessing how the proposal affects a population, with particular emphasis on the distribution of effects between different subgroups within the population. Recommendations can specifically target the improvement of health for vulnerable groups.It is a positive approachHIA looks not only for negative impacts (to prevent or reduce them), but also for impacts favourable to health. This provides decision-makers with options to strengthen and extend the positive features of a proposal, with a view to improving the health of the population.Appropriate for policies, programmes and projectsHIA is suitable for use at many different levels. HIA can be used on projects, programmes (groupings of projects) and policies, though it has most commonly been used on projects. The flexibility of HIA allows these projects, programmes and policies to be assessed at either a local, regional, national or international level – making HIA suitable for almost any proposal. However, choosing the right moment to carry out an HIA is important (see screening).TimelinessTo influence the decision-making process, HIA recommendations must reach the decision-makers well before any decisions about the proposal will be made. This basic principle of HIA highlights the practical nature of the approach. Experienced HIA practitioners can work within most timeframes, undertaking comprehensive (longer) or rapid (shorter) HIAs.Links with sustainable development and resource managementIf the HIA is undertaken at a sufficiently early stage in the project process, it can be used as a key tool for sustainable development. For example, an HIA on building a road would enable inclusion of health and other sustainability aspects - such as cycle lanes, noise and speed reduction interventions - to be included from the very beginning, rather than at a later date. This enables health objectives to be considered at the same level as socio-economic and environmental objectives, an important step towards sustainable development. Another feature of HIA is its possible combination with other impact assessment methods. This integration allows proposals to be assessed from a sustainable development perspective including: health, education, employment, business success, safety and security, culture, leisure and recreation, and the environment. Drawing on the wider determinants of health, and working across different sectors, HIA can play an important role in the sustainability agenda.Many people can use HIABecause it is a participatory approach, there are many potential users of HIA, including:Decision-makers who may use the information to select options more favourable to health;Commissioners of the HIA, who use it to consult widely and gather differing views, to build capacity and develop strong partnerships;HIA workers who carry out the individual components of the HIA, including consultants, local staff from a wide variety of organizations, and the community;Stakeholders, who want their views to be considered by decision-makers."
What are international policies and regulations for HIA?,"Several international policies and regulations make provisions for HIA or recommend its use, such as:Strategic Environmental AssessmentHealth effects are often poorly assessed within Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), or not at all. The establishment of a Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) Protocol – to supplement the UNECE Convention on EIA - has addressed this problem. In Kiev, in May 2003, governments of 35 European United Nations members signed the SEA protocol, whose provisions place special emphasis on human health, going beyond existing legislation. This reflects the political will of the governments, and the technical support of the health sector including WHO. The protocol also recommends that SEA be undertaken early enough in the decision-making process of proposals for environmental and health issues to be considered as part of a wider sustainability agenda.Article 152 of the Amsterdam TreatyThe Treaty calls for the European Union (EU) to examine the possible impact of major policies on health. The treaty states that ""A high level of health protection shall be ensured in connection with the formulation and implementation of all Community policies and all Community measures"". The European Commission's Health Strategy proposal states that policies must ensure that public health aspects be considered in all EU decisions and actions, therefore health impact assessments should be conducted.Environmental Impact AssessmentMany countries have statutory requirements for an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to be undertaken on every important project. The EU directive on EIA was introduced in 1985 and amended in 1997 and 2003. Country-specific links for environmental and strategic impact assessments can be found at the Impact Assessment Research Centre at the University of Manchester or the International Association for Impact Assessment. Unfortunately, an EIA does not typically include an assessment of the health effects, and when it does, it may be narrowly focused and only quantitative in nature.EU Strategic Environmental DirectiveThe European Commission began negotiations for a directive on the environmental assessment of plans and programmes in 1996. Several amendments to the proposal were made, leading to the SEA Directive being adopted by the European Council on 5 June 2001. The purpose of the SEA-Directive is to ensure that environmental consequences of certain plans and programmes are identified and assessed during their preparation and before their adoption. Member states were required to introduce the directive into their own legislation by 27 June 2004.Health21 – Health for allThe 51 countries comprising the WHO European Region have a common policy framework for health development, which outlines strategies to transform national policies into practical operational programmes at the local level. After consultations with Member States and several important organizations in the Region, four main strategies for action were chosen to ensure that scientific, economic, social and political sustainability drive the implementation of  Health21. The first is that ""multisectoral strategies tackle the determinants of health, taking into account physical, economic, social, cultural and gender perspectives and ensuring the use of health impact assessment"".Environmental Health ConferencesThe 3rd ministerial conference on environmental health, held in London in 1999, recognized access to information, public participation and access to justice in environment and health as important issues. Several countries supported the idea of a protocol on strategic environment and health impact assessment, and the theme was submitted to the following environment and health conference in Budapest, in 2004.Libreville DeclarationIn 2008, the Libreville Declaration on Health and Environment in Africa encouraged governments to integrate health and the environment within public policies, poverty reduction strategies and national development plans. The implementation of health and environment intersectoral programmes at all levels is considered to be one of the decisive factors that may lead to the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals."
What happened?,"On 26 April 1986, an explosion and fires at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine caused the largest
uncontrolled radioactive release in the history of the civil nuclear industry. Over the next 10 days, large
quantities of radioactive iodine and caesium were released into the air. Most of this material was
deposited near the installation, but lighter material was carried by wind currents over Belarus, the
Russian Federation and Ukraine and, to some extent, over parts of Europe."
What were the main radionuclides to which people were exposed?,"The main radionuclides to which individuals were exposed were iodine-131, caesium-134 and caesium137.Iodine-131 has a short radioactive half-life (eight days) and can be transferred to humans rapidly
through the air and by consumption of contaminated milk and leafy vegetables. Iodine becomes
localized in the thyroid gland. Because many infants and children consume relatively large quantities of
milk and dairy products, and because of the size of their thyroid glands and the nature of their
metabolism, exposure to radioactive iodine is usually higher for children than for adults.Caesium isotopes have longer half-lives (caesium-134 and caesium-137 have half-lives of 2 years and
30 years, respectively). There are thus longer-term exposures to these radionuclides through the
ingestion pathway and through external exposure from their deposition on the ground."
What levels of exposure did people experience?,"The average effective doses among 530,000 recovery operation workers was 120 millisieverts (mSv);
among 115,000 evacuees, 30 mSv; among residents of contaminated areas, 9 mSv (during the first two
decades after the accident); and among residents of other European countries, less than 1 mSv (in the
first year after the accident).
In more distant countries, doses of exposure decreased progressively in subsequent years. Since such
doses are below the global average annual dose of 2.4 mSv from natural background radiation, the
radiation exposures in countries distant from Chernobyl are considered to be of little radiological and
public health significance."
What were the impacts on health from Chernobyl?,"In 2006, WHO published its report summarizing the data from two decades of research on the health
consequences of the Chernobyl accident. It included reviews of studies carried out on cancers, noncancer diseases, immune and genetic effects, and reproductive and children’s health, as well as
evidence-based recommendations for national health authorities and for further research.In 2011, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR)
published a report entitled ""Health effects due to radiation from the Chernobyl accident."" The findings
were based on more than two decades of experimental and analytical studies of the health
consequences of radiation exposure from the Chernobyl accident. The report is the most comprehensive
evaluation to date of exposure levels and health effects from the Chernobyl accident.Radiation sicknessAccording to the UNSCEAR report, the Chernobyl accident caused a number of severe radiation
effects almost immediately. Of 600 workers present on the site during the early morning of 26 April
1986, 134 received very high doses (0.8-16 Grey) and suffered from acute radiation sickness. Of those,
28 workers died in the first three months.Radiation-induced cataractsAmong those who survived radiation sickness, recovery took several years. Many of them developed
radiation-induced cataracts in the first few years after the accident. Recent studies of the recovery
operation workers indicate that opacities of the eye lens might result from radiation doses lower than
previously expected (about 500 mSv).CancersFor the last two decades, attention has been focused on investigating the association between exposure
to radionuclides released in the Chernobyl accident and late effects, in particular thyroid cancer. In the
first few months after the accident, radiation dose exposures to the thyroid received were particularly
high in children and adolescents living in Belarus, Ukraine and the most affected regions of the Russian
Federation, and in those who drank milk with high levels of radioactive iodine. By 2005, more than
6,000 thyroid cancer cases had been diagnosed in this group. It is most likely that a large fraction of
these thyroid cancers are attributable to radioiodine intake. Furthermore, it is expected that increases in
thyroid cancer incidence due to the Chernobyl accident will continue for many more years, although
long-term increases are difficult to quantify.Apart from the dramatic increase in thyroid cancer incidence among those exposed at a young age,
there is some indication of increased leukaemia and cataract incidence among workers. Otherwise,
there is no clearly demonstrated increase in the incidence of solid cancers or leukaemia due to radiation
in the exposed populations. There also is no convincing proof so far of increases in other nonmalignant disorders that are related to ionizing radiation.Among 530,000 registered recovery operation workers who worked between 1986 and 1990, the
average dose was 120 mSv (ranging from 20 to 500 mSv). That cohort is still potentially at risk of
cancer and other diseases and their health continues to be closely followed.Among Russian recovery operation workers with higher average doses (above 200 mSv), evidence is
emerging of some increase in the incidence of leukaemia. Based on other studies, the annual incidence
of radiation-induced leukaemia would be expected to fall within a few decades after exposure.There is a tendency to attribute increases in rates of all cancers over time to the Chernobyl accident, but
it should be noted that increases in cancer in the affected areas were also observed before the accident.
Moreover, a general increase in mortality has been reported in recent decades in most areas of the
former Soviet Union, and this must be taken into account when interpreting the results of the accident-related studies.Persistent psychological or mental health problemsSeveral international studies have reported that exposed populations, compared to controls, had anxiety
symptom levels that were twice as high and were more likely to report multiple unexplained physical
symptoms and subjective poor health. Given that rates of mental health problems increase after a
disaster and may manifest years after the event, WHO recommends improving availability and access
to normal community mental health services in disaster-affected areas.One of the objectives of the on-going UN inter-agency International Chernobyl Research and
Information Network (ICRIN) project is to alleviate the stigma of psychological trauma in
society, encourage self-reliance, and empower local communities to take control over their own lives.
One of the ways to achieve these goals is to promote healthy lifestyles, including physical activity and
healthy diet, and to explain the environmental, behavioural, and other risks for various chronic diseases,
including cancer. Concerns related to fertility and birth defectsIn the Chernobyl-affected regions, there is no evidence of decreased fertility among males or females in
the general population. However, birth rates may be lower in contaminated areas because of a high rate
of medical abortions.Since 1986, there has been a reported increase in congenital malformations in both contaminated and
uncontaminated areas of Belarus which predated Chernobyl and may be the result of increased
registration of such cases. Based on dose levels to which the majority of the population was exposed,
there is unlikely to be a major effect on the number of stillbirths, adverse pregnancy outcomes, delivery
complications, or the overall health of children, but monitoring remains important.Potential impact on health in other European countriesSo far, there has been no clear evidence of any measurable increases in adverse health effects related to
the Chernobyl radiation in countries outside of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine."
What is the current health risk to people residing in contaminated areas?,"Currently, concentrations of radioactive caesium (Cs-137) in agricultural food products produced in
areas affected by the Chernobyl fallout are generally below national and international standards for
actions. In some limited areas with high radionuclide contamination (e.g. in parts of the Gomel and
Mogilev regions in Belarus and the Bryansk region in the Russian Federation) or areas with organic
poor soils (the Zhytomir and Rovno regions in Ukraine), milk may still be produced with activity
concentrations of Cs-137 that exceed national standards for action (100 Becquerel per kilogram). In
these areas, countermeasures and environmental remediation may still be warranted."
What are some of the actions taken by the World Health Organization?,"See WHO's Involvement in the Chernobyl Accident for
more details on WHO involvement since 1986.1991The governments of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine asked the UN to examine the
health effects of the Chernobyl accident and to visit the areas in question. WHO secured US$20 million
in extra-budgetary funding to create a project on the health effects of Chernobyl.1994WHO's Regional Office for Europe initiated an international project on thyroid pathologies,
which ran until September 2000. The project helped Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine
enhance the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of thyroid pathologies and improve the methods of
identification of causes, nature, and estimated scope of radiation-induced thyroid cancer. Special
priority was accorded to screening for thyroid cancer, establishment of an integrated database, medical
examinations for iodine deficiency, design of testing systems for measuring thyroid gland hormones,
capacity-building, including staff training.1995A WHO conference in Geneva brought together a broad variety of scientists from all over the
world and resulted in publication of a set of key papers in a special 1996 issue of the WHO Bulletin (a
copy of the journal is available upon request).2002The UN Strategy for Recovery gave all UN agencies and the international community a
framework for rebuilding the most-affected areas of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine.2003Within the UN Strategy for Recovery, representatives from the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA), the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the UN Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN
Environment Programme (UNEP), UNSCEAR, WHO and the World Bank and Belarus, the Russian
Federation and Ukraine established and launched the Chernobyl Forum.2006The Chernobyl Forum released the most authoritative scientific findings of that time on the
accident’s consequences for health and the environment. The health impact of the accident was summarized in the report developed by WHO — Health Effects of the Chernobyl Accident and Special
Health Care Programmes.The WHO Expert Group ""Health"" (EGH) set criteria for inclusion in the report based on solid
methodology and reliable estimates of exposure assessment. Consequently, reports published in peerreviewed literature, and available by the time of the Expert Group meetings, were included. National
experts from Belarus, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine participated in each EGH meeting and
shared the set criteria. The report was finalized at the end 2005 and published in spring 2006.The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an international cancer research
institution established by WHO, published estimated projections of 25,000 potential excess cancers for
Europe (Cardis et al. 2006) through 2065 that might be attributable to exposure to radiation from
Chernobyl of which 16,000 cases could be fatal.
2007-2008 Following the UN inter-agency Chernobyl Forum in 2006, the UN launched its Action Plan
for the third decade of Chernobyl until 2016. As part of the UN family, WHO has a mandate to
implement this Action Plan according to UN General Assembly resolutions. 2007-2008Following the UN inter-agency Chernobyl Forum in 2006, the UN launched its Action Plan
for the third decade of Chernobyl until 2016. As part of the UN family, WHO has a mandate to
implement this Action Plan according to UN General Assembly resolutions.2009-2011The International Chernobyl Research and Information Network (ICRIN) was launched by
four United Nations agencies, as a part of the UN Action Plan implementation programme, to meet the
information needs of affected communities in Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. This threeyear initiative is part of a larger effort to help local communities “return to normal” in the course of the
decade that ends in 2016 and aims to translate the latest scientific information on the consequences of
the accident into sound practical advice for residents of the affected territories. Activities planned under
the ICRIN project include the dissemination of information, through education and training for teachers,
medical professionals, community leaders, and the media; providing local residents with practical
advice on health risks and healthy lifestyles; the creation of internet-equipped information centers in
rural areas; and small-scale community infrastructure projects aimed at improving living conditions and
promoting self-reliance. 2010IARC completed an EC-funded project on the development of a strategic research agenda (SRA)
for Chernobyl studies (8), where a group of experts and advisors supports proposals for the long-term
funding of a Chernobyl Health Effects Research Foundation (similar to the action taken to create the
Radiation Effects Research Foundation some years after the atomic bomb exposures in Japan) together
with a series of individual studies covering the main health consequences. These include a focus on
thyroid cancer, breast cancer, inherited molecular-genetic alterations, various other cancers, cataracts,
and other non-cancer diseases in nuclear plant workers and in the general, exposed population. 2011An UNSCEAR report (9)  on Chernobyl recognized that while new research data has become
available, major conclusions regarding the scale and nature of the health consequences of the 1986
Chernobyl accident were ""essentially consistent with previous assessments"".UNSCEAR reported more than 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer, of which 15 have been fatal, among
people who were children or adolescents in Belarus, the four most affected regions in the Russian Federation, and Ukraine. A substantial proportion of cases were associated with radiation exposure.
The report also reconfirmed that radiation doses to the public from the 1986 accident were relatively
low and most residents ""need not live in fear of serious health consequences"".OngoingSince the start of the ICRIN project in 2009, WHO has developed information materials and
carried out trainings and workshops targeting primary health care workers, teachers, and mass-media
workers of the most affected regions of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. An ICRIN side
event co-sponsored by WHO was featured in conjunction with the international conference held in
Kiev, Ukraine on 20-21 April 2011. Four WHO Collaborating Centres in the Russia Federation and
Ukraine are leading the health research project on Chernobyl-affected populations."
What is WHO's relationship with the IAEA?,"WHO and the IAEA are both UN entities. WHO is the directing and coordinating authority for health
within the United Nations system. It is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters,
shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy
options, providing technical support to countries, and monitoring and assessing health trends.The IAEA is the UN system agency which works with its Member States and multiple partners
worldwide to promote safe, secure and peaceful nuclear technologies.
WHO collaborates with the IAEA on a number of areas including the medical use of radiation,
radiation protection and the safety of the public and workers, and radio-nuclear emergency
preparedness and response.Under the auspices of the UN Chernobyl Forum, WHO carried out its own independent health
assessment of the accident. The IAEA assessed the environmental impact and UNDP the socioeconomic impact.A digest document including summaries of the three reports (WHO Health report, IAEA environmental
report, and UNDP socio-economic impact report) entitled Chernobyl Legacy was then prepared jointly
by three agencies to present a comprehensive picture of the event, and was endorsed by all participants
of the Chernobyl Forum, including eight UN Agencies and the Governments of Belarus, the Russian
Federation, and Ukraine.Mention has often been made of WHO's 1959 agreement with the IAEA. This is a standard agreement
similar to agreements it has with other UN agencies as a means of setting out respective areas of work.
This agreement has never once been used to stop or restrict WHO’s work.The agreement serves the purpose of promoting co-operation and consultation between WHO and
IAEA. It was approved by the highest governing body of each Organization.The agreement between WHO and IAEA does not affect the impartial and independent exercise by
WHO of its statutory responsibilities, nor does it subordinate one Organization to the other. The clause appearing in Article III dealing with the safeguarding of confidential information is a
standard provision in many agreements of this kind (including WHO agreements with the UN, ILO,
FAO, UNESCO, and UNIDO). On the one hand, it ensures each Organization will continue to meet its obligations to protect certain information it is duty bound to safeguard. In the case of information held
by WHO, such a clause is relevant, for example, for the protection of clinical and other similar data on
individuals. On the other hand, the provision makes clear that subject to such situations, each
Organization ""shall keep [the] other fully informed [of] all … work"" of mutual interest. Thus, such
provisions actually work to improve information flow as they limit the exceptions to the free-flow of
information. WHO environmental health experts will continue the scientific collaboration with
radiation and health experts at IAEA. This entails not only nuclear safety issues and assistance in
radiation emergencies, but also the application of clinical techniques connected with such issues.WHO activities on nuclear matters are not in any way hampered by the WHO/IAEA agreement. Both
Organizations are working tirelessly to assist countries and the global community to deal with this
complex emergency."
What have been the wider impacts of the Chernobyl accident?,"In countries beyond those most directly affected, Chernobyl triggered questions concerning the safety of
crops, milk, food, and water; the effects of radiation exposure on different population groups; and the
kind of preventive measures that were to be put in place. In many countries, the accident prompted
important political discussions regarding the use of nuclear energy and national energy policies.Chernobyl underscored the critical need for international coordination and cooperation related to
environmental hazards. Chernobyl also prompted UN agencies to develop international agreements and
arrangements for nuclear emergencies. In 1986, two international conventions were adopted by the
IAEA’s General Conference: the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the
Convention on Assistance in the Case of Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency. WHO, which is
a party to both conventions, set up the Radiation Emergency Medical Preparedness and Assistance
Network - WHO REMPAN - in 1987. Today, the network includes more than 40 centres world-wide
specialized in radiation emergency medicine, dosimetry, diagnosis and treatment of radiation injuries,
public health interventions and long-term follow-up."

Do UVA and UVB affect the body in different ways?,"The skinUVA activates melanin pigment already present in the upper skin cells. It creates a tan that appears quickly but is also lost quickly. Furthermore, UVA penetrates into the deeper skin layers, where connective tissue and blood vessels are affected. As a result the skin gradually loses its elasticity and starts to wrinkle. Therefore, large doses of UVA cause premature ageing. Furthermore, recent studies strongly suggest that it may enhance the development of skin cancers. The mechanisms of this UVA damage are not fully understood, but a popular hypothesis assumes that UVA increases oxidative stress in the cell.UVB stimulates the production of new melanin, which leads to a heavy increase in the dark-coloured pigment within a few days. This tan may last a relatively long time. UVB also stimulates the cells to produce a thicker epidermis. Therefore, UVB is responsible both for the darkening and thickening of the outer cell layers – these reactions are the body's defence against further UV damage.However, higher doses of UVB cause sunburn which increases your likelihood of developing cancer. The exact mechanism of how UVB initiates or promotes cancer is not yet known. In people suffering from Xeroderma pigmentosum, a rare pigmentation disease, the ability to repair DNA damage caused by exposure to UV radiation is impaired. The much-increased rates of skin cancer in these patients suggest that direct UV damage of DNA may be the mechanism that links exposure to the development of cancer.The eyeAs with effects on the skin, the various incoming sun rays penetrate the eye to different depths. While UVB is fully absorbed by the cornea, UVA passes through these surface layers to the lens. Among adults only 1 per cent or less of incoming UV radiation reaches the retina because of the filter function of cornea and lens. In contrast visible light easily penetrates through to the retina, where it activates photoreceptors and starts the chain reaction of biochemical processes to produce a visible image.The immune systemMost experiments to date have concentrated on UVB, as it appears to be more important than UVA in causing immunemodulation. However, recently the interest in the effects of UVA on the immune system has been growing. It is believed that UV radiation is absorbed by a molecule located in the skin. This leads to changes in the distribution and activity of some of the key molecular and cellular players of the immune system. An altered balance of the immune response through cells and antibodies may reduce the body's ability to defend itself against certain diseases."
Are there beneficial effects of UV radiation?,"The sun's rays provide warmth and light that enhance your general feeling of well-being and stimulate blood circulation. Some UV radiation is essential to the body as it stimulates the production of vitamin D. Vitamin D has an important function in increasing calcium and phosphorus absorption from food and plays a crucial role in skeletal development, immune function and blood cell formation. There is no doubt that a little sunlight is good for you! But 5 to 15 minutes of casual sun exposure of hands, face and arms two to three times a week during the summer months is sufficient to keep your vitamin D levels high. Closer to the equator, where UV levels are higher, even shorter periods of exposure suffice.Hence, for most people, vitamin D deficiency is unlikely. Possible exceptions are those who have very limited sun exposure such as the housebound elderly, or those with heavily pigmented skin who live in high-latitude countries where UV levels are relatively low. Recognising the need for vitamin D, many countries have introduced supplements into common food like flour, cereals and milk. Naturally occurring vitamin D is very rare in our diet, it is present mainly in fatty fish and cod liver oil.UV radiation has been used to successfully treat a number of diseases, including rickets, psoriasis, eczema and jaundice. This therapeutic use cannot eliminate the negative side-effects of UV radiation but treatment takes place under medical supervision to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks.RicketsRickets causes a child's bones to soften because they are not getting enough calcium. One common reason for this is a lack of vitamin D. Vitamin D increases calcium absorption from food and transports the ion from the gut into the bone. UV radiation exposure stimulates the production of vitamin D. However, today, most people receive enough vitamin D from supplements in the food they eat.Lupus vulgarisLupus vulgaris is tuberculosis of the skin. It used to be common especially in northern Europe during the winter. The disease produces large ulcers on the face and neck, which are difficult to cure and often leave bad scars. A Danish doctor called Neils Finzen developed a UVB lamp that was so successful in curing the disease that it won him the Nobel prize in 1903. Today, Lupus is very rare and is usually treated successfully with antibiotics.PsoriasisPsoriasis is a disease which produces sores and scaling of the skin. It affects 2 to 3 per cent of the population and is probably an autoimmune disease; a disease where your immune system attacks your own cells. Among the treatments for psoriasis PUVA therapy is one of the most popular and successful. The patient is given a drug called psoralen to make the skin more sensitive to UV and is subsequently exposed to UVA radiation. This is repeated several times in the course of treatment. Unfortunately, PUVA treatment increases the patient's risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer.VitiligoVitiligo is a patchy loss of skin pigmentation caused by destruction of the pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. It is probably an autoimmune disease and can be treated by PUVA therapy. In PUVA treatment, the patient is given a drug called psoralen to make the skin more sensitive to UV and is subsequently exposed to UVA radiation. The therapy is fairly successful but increases the patient's risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer.Despite these important roles and medical applications, the harmful effects of exposure to UV radiation usually far outweigh its benefits. In addition to the well-known short-term effects of overexposure to the sun such as sunburn or allergic reactions, long-term effects pose a life-long hazard to your health. Overexposure to UV radiation affects your skin, your eyes and probably your immune system. Many people forget that the effects of exposure to UV radiation accumulate over a lifetime. Your sun exposure behaviour now determines your chances of developing skin cancer or cataracts later in life! Skin cancer incidence is strongly correlated with the duration and frequency of sun exposure."
What are the effects of UV on the skin?,"The truth about a suntanThere is no such thing as a healthy tan! The skin produces a dark-coloured pigment, melanin, as a shield against further damage from UV radiation. The darkening provides some protection against sunburn: a dark tan on a white skin offers a sun protection factor of between 2 and 4. However, it is no defence against long-term UV damage such as skin cancer. A suntan may be cosmetically desirable, but in fact it is nothing but a sign that your skin has been damaged and has attempted to protect itself.There are two distinct types of tanning reaction: immediate pigment darkening occurs, where the pigment called melanin already present in the skin darkens on exposure to UVA. This immediate tan begins to fade within a few hours after cessation of exposure. Delayed tanning happens over a period of about three days, when new melanin is produced and distributed between the upper skin cells. This tan can persist for several weeks.SunburnHigh doses of UV radiation kill most of the skin cells in the upper skin layer, and cells that are not killed get damaged. In its mildest form, sunburn consists of a reddening of the skin called erythema. This appears shortly after UV radiation exposure and reaches a maximum intensity between 8 and 24 hours. It then fades over the course of a few days. However, a strong sunburn may cause the skin to blister and peel, which is not only painful but also leaves the very white and new skin underneath unprotected and even more prone to UV damage.PhotosensitivityA small percentage of the population have a skin condition that makes them particularly sensitive to the sun's UV rays. A minimal dose of UV radiation is sufficient to trigger an allergic reaction leading to rash or severe sunburn. Photosensitivity is often associated with the use of certain medications, including some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers, tranquillizers, oral anti-diabetics, antibiotics and antidepressants. If you take any medication on a regular basis, please refer to the package insert for the product or consult your health care provider about possible photosensitivity reactions. Some foods and cosmetic products like fragrances and soaps may also contain ingredients that cause or aggravate the photosensitivity condition.The wrinkle factorSun exposure promotes the ageing of your skin due to a combination of several factors. UVB stimulates cell proliferation in the outer layer of the skin. As more and more cells are produced the epidermis thickens. UVA penetrating into the deeper skin layers disturbs the connective tissue: the skin gradually loses its elasticity. Wrinkles, sags and bags are the common result of this loss of elasticity. A phenomenon often seen in elderly people is the localized over-production of melanin resulting in dark patches or liver spots. Furthermore, the sun's rays dry out your skin making it coarse and leathery.Non-melanoma skin cancersBasal cell carcinomaIn contrast to malignant melanoma, the non-melanoma skin cancers basal and squamous cell carcinoma are not usually fatal but surgical treatment can be painful and result in scars. Non-melanoma skin cancers are most frequent on those parts of the body that are commonly exposed to the sun such as ears, face, neck and forearms. The finding that they are more frequent in outdoor than in indoor workers suggests that the accumulated life-time exposure to UV radiation plays a major role in the development of non-melanoma skin cancers.Basal cell carcinomas are the most common type of skin cancer. Their reported incidence has drastically increased over the past two decades and continues to rise. They usually appear as a red lump or scaly area, however, no clear precursors have been identified. They grow slowly, rarely spread to other parts of the body (metastasize) and can be removed surgically.Squamous cell carcinomaSquamous cell carcinomas are the second most common form of skin cancer. They appear as a thickened red scaly spot at body sites most often exposed to UV radiation. As they sometimes metastasize they are more dangerous than basal cell carcinomas. However, they also tend to be slow growing and can usually be removed surgically before they become a serious risk.Melanoma skin cancersMalignant melanoma is the rarest but most dangerous type of skin cancer. It is one of the most common cancers among 20- to 35-year-olds, especially in Australia and New Zealand. All forms of skin cancer have been on the increase over the past twenty years, however, the highest rate of increase worldwide is noted for malignant melanoma.Malignant melanomaMalignant melanoma may arise as a new mole or as changes in colour, shape, size or sensation of an old spot, freckle or mole. Melanomas tend to have an irregular outline and a patchy colouring. Itching is another common symptom but is also found in normal moles. If recognized and treated early, the chances of survival are good. If untreated, the tumour can develop rapidly, and cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body.The causes of malignant melanoma are not fully understood. Exposure during childhood is thought to be more important than exposure later in life. Tumour development may be linked to occasional exposure to short periods of intense sunlight, such as at weekends or on holiday. The higher incidence of malignant melanoma in indoor workers compared to outdoor workers supports that notion.Watch out for early symptoms of malignant melanomaIf you have a mole, freckle or spot you are concerned about, go and see a dermatologist! It may well not be a melanoma; however, if it is a melanoma, it is crucial that it is recognized and treated early.Check regularly for any mole that grows, changes shape or colour, is inflamed or itchy, weeps or bleed"
What are the effects of UV on the eye?,"The eye occupies less than 2 per cent of the whole body surface area, but it represents the sole organ system to allow the penetration of visible light deep into the human body. During human evolution a number of mechanisms have evolved to protect this very sensitive organ against harmful effects of the sun's rays:The eye is recessed within the anatomy of the head and shielded well by the brow ridge, the eyebrows and the eyelashes. However, these anatomical adaptations are of limited use in UV protection under extreme conditions such as sunbed use or strong ground reflection from snow, water and sand.Constriction of the pupil, closure of the eyelids and the squinting reflex minimize the penetration of the sun's rays into the eye. These mechanisms are activated by bright visible light and not by UV radiation – but on a cloudy day UV radiation exposure may still be high. Therefore, the effectiveness of these natural defences in protecting against UV damage is limited.Photokeratitis and photoconjunctivitisPhotokeratitis is an inflammation of the cornea, while photoconjunctivitis refers to an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the membrane that lines the inside of the eyelids and eye socket. These inflammatory reactions may be compared to a sunburn of the very sensitive skin-like tissues of the eyeball and eyelids and usually appear within a few hours of exposure. Photokeratitis and photoconjunctivitis can be very painful, however, they are reversible and do not seem to result in any long-term damage to the eye or vision.An extreme form of photokeratitis is snow blindness. It sometimes occurs in skiers and climbers who experience extreme UV levels due to high altitude conditions and very strong ground reflection – fresh snow can reflect up to 80 per cent of incident UV radiation. These extreme UV levels kill the outer cells of the eyeball leading to blindness. Snow blindness is very painful when the dead cells are being shed. In the majority of cases new cells grow quickly and vision is restored within a few days. Very severe snow blindness may involve complications such as chronic irritations or tearing.PterygiumThis growth of the conjunctiva on the surface of the eye is a common cosmetic blemish and is probably linked to prolonged UV exposure. Pterygium may extend over the centre of the cornea and thereby reduce vision. It also has a tendency to become inflamed. Even though it can be removed by surgery, the outgrowth tends to recur.CataractsCataracts are the leading cause of blindness in the world. Proteins in the eye's lens unravel, tangle and accumulate pigments which cloud the lens and eventually lead to blindness. Even though cataracts appear to different degrees in most individuals as they age, they appear to be enhanced by exposure to UVB. Cataracts can be surgically removed and an artificial lens or other means of optical correction can restore vision.Every year some 16 million people in the world suffer from blindness due to a loss of transparency in the lens. WHO estimates suggest that up to 20 per cent of cataracts may be caused by overexposure to UV radiation and are therefore avoidable.Cancer of the eyeCurrent scientific evidence suggests that different forms of eye cancer may be associated with life-long exposure to the sun. Melanoma is the most frequent malignant cancer of the eyeball and sometimes requires surgical removal. A common location for basal cell carcinoma is on the eyelids."
Does UV interact with the immune system?,"Sunlight exposure can precede the onset of recurrent eruptions of cold sores. UVB radiation appears to reduce the effectiveness of the immune system – in the case of cold sores it can no longer keep the virus Herpes simplex under control which results in re-activation of the infection. A study in the United States looked into the effect of sunscreen application on the incidence of cold sores. Of 38 patients, who recurrently suffer from Herpes simplex infections, 27 developed cold sores after exposure to UV radiation. In contrast, after the application of protective sunscreen, none of the patients developed cold sores. Therefore, beyond limiting skin-damaging effects, sunscreen may be effective in the prevention of sunlight-induced recurrent eruptions.Research in recent years has provided increasing evidence that exposure to environmental UV levels can alter the activity and distribution of some of the cells responsible for triggering immune responses in humans. As a consequence sun exposure may enhance risk of infection or reduce the body's defences against skin cancer. Especially in countries of the developing world, high UV levels may decrease the effectiveness of vaccinations.It has also been suggested that UV radiation may promote cancer in two distinct ways: by directly inducing DNA damage and by weakening the immune system. To date little research has been undertaken to describe the potential influence of immunomodulation on the development of cancer."
I am dark-skinned – do I still need to be careful?,"Yes, you do. Compared to fair-skinned people, dark-skinned people have a much lower risk of developing melanoma or non-melanoma skin cancers. They do not normally have to apply sunscreens and can safely tolerate relatively high levels of UV radiation without getting burnt. But – regardless of skin colour - the risk of eye damage and of harmful effects on the immune system remains."
What are some simple ways to protect oneself from sun?,"Adopting the following simple precautions, adapted from the Sun Wise School Program can make all the difference. Shade, clothing and hats provide the best protection – applying sunscreen becomes necessary on those parts of the body that remain exposed like the face and hands. Sunscreen should never be used to prolong the duration of sun exposure.Limit time in the midday sunThe sun’s UV rays are the strongest between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. To the extent possible, limit exposure to the sun during these hours.Watch for the  UV indexThis important resource helps you plan your outdoor activities in ways that prevent overexposure to the sun’s rays. While you should always take precautions against overexposure, take special care to adopt sun safety practices when the UV Index predicts exposure levels of moderate or above.Use shade wiselySeek shade when UV rays are the most intense, but keep in mind that shade structures such as trees, umbrellas or canopies do not offer complete sun protection. Remember the shadow rule: ""Watch your shadow – Short shadow, seek shade!""Wear protective clothingA hat with a wide brim offers good sun protection for your eyes, ears, face, and the back or your neck. Sunglasses that provide 99 to 100 percent UV-A and UV-B protection will greatly reduce eye damage from sun exposure. Tightly woven, loose fitting clothes will provide additional protection from the sun.Use sunscreenApply a broad-spectrum sunscreen of SPF 15+ liberally and re-apply every two hours, or after working, swimming, playing or exercising outdoors.Avoid  sunlamps and tanning parloursSunbeds damage the skin and unprotected eyes and are best avoided entirely."
How about protecting children from the sun?,"Sun protection programmes are urgently needed to raise awareness of the health hazards of UV radiation, and to achieve changes in lifestyle that will arrest the trend towards more and more skin cancers. Beyond the health benefits, effective education programmes can strengthen national economies by reducing the financial burden to health care systems caused by skin cancer and cataract treatments.Children are in a dynamic state of growth, and are therefore more susceptible to environmental threats than adults. Many vital functions such as the immune system are not fully developed at birth, and unsafe environments may interfere with their normal development.Schools are vitally important settings to promote sun protection and effective programmes can make a difference"
Do children require special protection?,"Children are in a dynamic state of growth and are more susceptible to environmental threats than adults as:sun exposure during childhood and adolescence appears to set the stage for the development of both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers in later lifea significant part of a person’s lifetime exposure occurs before age 18, andchildren have more time to develop diseases with long latency, more years of life to be lost and more suffering to be endured as a result of impaired health.Children require special protection. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that children, including all developmental stages from conception to age 18, have the right to enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to a safe environment."
How should children be protected from the sun in schools?,"Educational programmes in schools to enhance children’s knowledge and modify attitudes and behavior regarding sun protection can significantly decrease adverse health effects and health care costs. Schools are an excellent place to teach healthy behaviors that can prevent overexposure to UV radiation. In an environment that is geared towards learning school children are especially susceptible to fashion trends, while teachers can play a major role in influencing children’s knowledge, attitudes and behavior regarding sun protection.An effective campaign can have an enormous impact on public health: the SunSmart Campaign (Fig. 2) of The Cancer Council Victoria in Australia, has made significant progress in raising awareness of the issues of sun protection and skin cancer as well as encouraging changes in sun-related lifestyle.A school program on sun protection should adopt an integrated approach to help students, teachers, and the wider community to avoid health risks of UV radiation exposure. The program should include sun protection education, a healthy school environment, a school-endorsed sun protection policy, and community and family involvement. An evaluation of school programs to promote sun protection is a powerful tool that WHO recommends for implementing and strengthening school health programs. Activities are most effective if they have a practical focus and are relevant to the students’ own experiences. Sun protection can easily be integrated into a range of curriculum areas.WHO has developed a comprehensive package of materials for children’s sun protection education. It is intended for Ministries of Health and Education, as well as national and local authorities and non-governmental organizations active in the area of health promotion and sun protection programs."
What is radar?,"Radar systems detect the presence, direction or range of aircraft, ships or other, usually moving objects. This is achieved by sending pulses of high frequency electromagnetic fields (EMF). Invented some 60 years ago, radar systems have been widely used for navigation, aviation, national defence and weather forecasting. Their primary objective is individual and collective safety and protection.People who live or routinely work around radars have expressed concerns about long-term adverse effects of these systems on health, including cancer, reproductive malfunction, cataracts and changes in behaviour or development of children. A recent example has been the alleged increase in testicular cancer in police using speed control handheld radar guns.It is important to distinguish between perceived and real dangers that radars pose, as well as to understand the rationale behind existing international standards and protective measures used today."
Are EMF emissions dangerous?,"Radars usually operate at radio frequencies (RF) between 300 MHz and 15 GHz. They generate EMFs that are called RF fields. RF fields within this part of the electromagnetic spectrum are known to interact differently with human body.RF fields below 10 GHz (to 1 MHz) penetrate exposed tissues and produce heating due to energy absorption. The depth of penetration depends on the frequency of the field and is greater for lower frequencies. Absorption of RF fields in tissues is measured as a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) within a given tissue mass. The unit of SAR is watts per kilogram (W/kg). SAR is the quantity used to measure the dose of RF fields between about 1 MHz and 10 GHz.An SAR of at least 4 W/kg is needed to produce known adverse health effects in people exposed to RF fields in this frequency range.RF fields above 10 GHz are absorbed at the skin surface, with very little of the energy penetrating into the underlying tissues. The basic dosimetric quantity for RF fields above 10 GHz is the intensity of the field measured as power density in watts per square metre (W/m2) or for weak fields in milliwatts per square metre (mW/m2) or microwatts per square metre (µW/m2).Exposure to RF fields above 10 GHz at power densities over 1000 W/m2 are known to produce adverse health effects, such as eye cataracts and skin burns."
When are humans exposed to dangerous amounts of radio frequencies?,"The power that radar systems emit varies from a few milliwatts (police traffic control radar) to many kilowatts (large space tracking radars). However, a number of factors significantly reduce human exposure to RF generated by radar systems, often by a factor of at least 100:Radar systems send      electromagnetic waves in pulses and not continuously. This makes the      average power emitted much lower than the peak pulse power.Radars are directional and      the RF energy they generate is contained in beams that are very narrow and      resemble the beam of a spotlight. RF levels away from the main beam fall      off rapidly. In most cases, these levels are thousands of times lower than      in the main beam.Many radars have antennas      which are continuously rotating or varying their elevation by a nodding      motion, thus constantly changing the direction of the beam.Areas, where dangerous human      exposure may occur are normally inaccessible to unauthorized personnel."
Where are radars used?,"Some of the common types of radars encountered in daily life include the following.Air traffic control radars are used to track the location of aircraft and to control their landing at airports. They are generally located at elevated positions where the beam is inaccessible to persons on the ground. Typical air traffic control radars can have peak powers of 100 kW or more, but average powers of a few hundred watts. Under normal operating conditions, these systems pose no hazard to the general public.Weather radars are often co-located with air traffic control radars in remote areas at airports. They operate at higher frequencies but generally have lower average and peak powers. As with air traffic control radars, under normal conditions, they pose no hazards to the public.Military radars are numerous and vary from large installations, which have high peak (1 MW or greater) and average powers (kW), to small military fire control radars, typically found on aircraft. Large size radars often evoke concern in communities living around them. However, because its power is radiated over a large surface area, the power densities associated with these systems vary between 10 and 100 W/m2 within the site boundary. Outside the site boundary RF field levels are usually unmeasurable without using sophisticated equipment. However, small military fire control radars on aircraft can be hazardous to ground personnel. These units have relatively high average powers (kW) and small area antennas, making it possible to have power densities up to 10 kW/m2. Members of the public would not be exposed to these emissions because during ground testing of radars access to these areas by all personnel is prohibited. The military also use most other types of radars described below.Marine radars can be found on small pleasure boats to large ocean going vessels. Peak powers of these systems can reach up to 30 kW, with average powers ranging from 1 to 25 W. Under normal operating conditions, with the antenna rotating, the average power density of the higher power systems within a metre of the antenna is usually less than 10 W/m2. In accessible areas on most watercraft, these levels would fall to a few percent of present public RF exposure standards.Speed control radars are hand-held by police in many countries. The average output power is very low - a few milliwatts - and so the units are not considered hazardous to health, even when used in very close proximity to the body."
What are the possible health effects of radar?,"Most studies conducted to date examined health effects other than cancer. They probed into physiological and thermoregulatory responses, behavioural changes and effects such as the induction of lens opacities (cataracts) and adverse reproductive outcome following acute exposure to relatively high levels of RF fields. There are also a number of studies that report non-thermal effects, where no appreciable rise in temperature can be measured.Cancer-related studies: Many epidemiological studies have addressed possible links between exposure to RF and excess risk of cancer. However, because of differences in the design and execution of these studies, their results are difficult to interpret. A number of national and international peer review groups have concluded that there is no clear evidence of links between RF exposure and excess risk of cancer. WHO has also concluded that there is no convincing scientific evidence that exposure to RF shortens the life span of humans, or that RF is an inducer or promoter of cancer. However, further studies are necessary.Thermal effects: RF fields have been studied in animals, including primates. The earliest signs of an adverse health consequence, found in animals as the level of RF fields increased, include reduced endurance, aversion of the field and decreased ability to perform mental tasks. These studies also suggest adverse effects may occur in humans subjected to whole body or localized exposure to RF fields sufficient to increase tissue temperatures by greater than 1°C. Possible effects include the induction of eye cataracts, and various physiological and thermoregulatory responses as body temperature increases. These effects are well established and form the scientific basis for restricting occupational and public exposure to RF fields.Non-thermal effects: Exposure to RF levels too low to involve heating, (i.e., very low SARs), has been reported by several groups to alter calcium ion mobility, which is responsible for transmitting information in tissue cells. However, these effects are not sufficiently established to provide a basis for restricting human exposure.Pulsed RF fields: Exposure to very intense pulsed RF fields, similar to those used by radar systems, has been reported to suppress the startle response and evoke body movements in conscious mice. In addition, people with normal hearing have perceived pulse RF fields with frequencies between about 200 MHz and 6.5 GHz. This is called the microwave hearing effect. The sound has been variously described as a buzzing, clicking, hissing or popping sound, depending on the RF pulsing characteristics. Prolonged or repeated exposure may be stressful and should be avoided where possible.RF shocks and burns: charges induced on metallic objects situated near radars. Persons standing in RF fields can also have high local absorption of the fields in areas of their bodies with small cross sectional areas, such as the ankles. In general, because of the higher frequencies that most modern radar systems operate, combined with their small beam widths, the potential for such effects is very small.Electromagnetic interference: Radars can cause electromagnetic interference in other electronic equipment. The thresholds for these effects are often well below guidance levels for human exposure to RF fields. Additionally, radars can also cause interference in certain medical devices, such as cardiac pacemakers and hearing aids. If individuals using such devices work near radar systems, they should contact manufacturers to determine the susceptibility of their products to RF interference.Ignition of flammable liquids and explosives: RF fields can ignite flammable liquids and explosives through the induction of currents. This is a rare occurrence, and normally of most concern where there is a large concentration of radars, such as on board a naval ship where measures are taken to prevent such effects."
What international standards regulate radar?,"Exposure limits for RF fields are developed by international bodies such as the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). ICNIRP is a non-governmental organization formally recognised by WHO. The Commission uses health risk assessments developed in conjunction with WHO to draft their guidelines on exposure limits. The ICNIRP guidelines protect against all established RF health effects and are developed following reviews of all the peer-reviewed scientific literature, including reports on cancer and non-thermal effects. Environmental RF levels from radars, in areas normally accessible to the general public, are at least 1,000 times below the limits for continuous public exposure allowed by the ICNIRP guidelines, and 25,000 times below the level at which RF exposure has been established to cause the earliest known health effects."
What other protective measures are in place?,"The aim of protective measures is to eliminate or reduce human exposure to RF fields below acceptable limits. An extensive program of measurement surveys, hazard communication, coupled with effective protective measures, is required around all radar installations. In most countries, comprehensive documentation is prepared, including an environmental impact statement, before a radar system can be constructed.Following construction of the radar facility, site surveys should be performed to quantify RF field levels in the area. While extremely high RF field levels can be measured directly in front of a radar, in most cases levels in public areas are not easily measurable. In order to prevent both workers and the general public from entering areas where the RF levels are above the limits, both engineering and administrative controls are used.Engineering controls include      interlocks, electronic means to exclude the radar pointing in certain      areas, and shielding.Administrative controls      include audible and visible alarms, warning signs, and restriction of      access through barriers, locked doors, or limiting access time to radar.When engineering and administrative controls do not suffice, workers should use personal protective equipment to ensure compliance with exposure standards. Conductive suits, gloves, safety shoes and other types of personal protective equipment for RF fields are now commercially available.They should be used with      great care, since the attenuation properties of the material used to make      this protective equipment can vary dramatically with frequency. Only when      the attenuation properties of the equipment are known at the frequency in      question can they be used reliably.Special care should be      exercised with RF safety glasses since any metal may enhance local fields      by acting as a receiving antenna.There are no exposure      situations where members of the public need to use protective equipment      for RF fields from radars.In recent years, clothing      and other materials have appeared on the consumer market claiming to have      RF shielding properties and directing their claims to soc-called sensitive      members of the general population, such as pregnant women. The use of      these types of products is unnecessary and should be discouraged. They      offer no effective RF shielding, and there is no need for these devices.Human exposure to EMF emitted by radar systems is limited by international standards and protective measures, which were adopted on the basis the currently available scientific evidence."
In summary,"RF fields cause molecules in      tissue to vibrate and generate heat. Heating effects could be expected if      time is spent directly in front of some radar antennas, but are not      possible at the environmental levels of RF fields emanating from radar      systems.To produce any adverse      health effect, RF exposure above a threshold level must occur. The known      threshold level is the exposure needed to increase tissue temperature by      at least 1oC. The very low RF environmental field levels from radar      systems cannot cause any significant temperature rise.To date, researchers have      not found evidence that multiple exposures to RF fields below threshold      levels cause any adverse health effects. No accumulation of damage occurs      to tissues from repeated low level RF exposure.At present, there is no      substantive evidence that adverse health effects, including cancer, can      occur in people exposed to RF levels at or below the limits set by      international standards. However, more research is needed to fill certain      gaps in knowledge."
Is it dangerous to use sunbeds?,"An expert in the field of radiation protection has referred to the use of tanning parlours as ""an industrial-scale radiation exposure experiment involving significant parts of the populations of Northern Europe and America."" Approximately 10 per cent of the population of Northern Europe use sunbeds on a regular basis for tanning purposes. Sunbed radiation can produce adverse health effects similar to those of natural sunlight, most notably in fair-skinned persistent users. In this context it is a subject of great concern that approximately 40 per cent of sunbed users in the United Kingdom have fair skin. The same study identified that 20 per cent of people questioned had more than 100 annual sunbed sessions, and 5 per cent had used sunbeds for 15 to 20 years."
Are sunbeds like sunlight?,"Natural UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface consists of approximately 95% UVA and 5% UVB radiation. Tanning parlours use different types of sunbeds, some emitting more, some emitting less UVB as compared to UVA. In the past, there was a trend towards a decrease of UVB and a corresponding increase in UVA. This was based on the experience that excessively UVB-rich sunbeds easily cause intermittent overexposures and risks of acute sunburns with a possible increased melanoma risk. On the other hand, excessive UVA exposure has lately been discussed as a possible melanoma risk factor in the scientific and regulatory community. Many sunbed manufacturers are now returning to relative amounts of UVA and UVB that mimic the natural composition in sunlight."
How do sunbeds produce a tan?,"Sunbeds mainly emit UVA radiation which activates the melanin pigment already embedded in the upper skin cells. This immediate tan begins to fade within a few hours after cessation of exposure, but can persist following sufficient and repeated exposure. The small amounts of UVB emitted by sunbeds induce the so-called delayed tanning reaction, where new melanin is produced and distributed between the upper skin cells.Increasing numbers of people rely on sunbeds for whole-body tanning and to tan beyond their normal complexion. This forced tanning is associated with DNA damage in melanocytes, the cells that produce the dark-coloured melanin pigment in the skin. In genetically dark-skinned individuals, relatively little DNA damage is sufficient to bring about the extra-tanning effect. In contrast forced tanning in fair-skinned individuals is associated with a lot of DNA damage. It is mainly fair-skinned people who are keen to darken their complexion.Sunbeds are not as successful in producing a tan as the people using them would like them to be. A recent British survey reported that only 2/3 of the regular sunbed users interviewed had achieved moderate tanning, while 1/3 had gained a mild tan; some also reported patchy tanning."
"Surely, sunbed use offers protection against sunburn?","A recent survey suggests that 40 per cent of sunbed users believe they can prevent sunburning on holiday by obtaining a tan beforehand. To put things into perspective: a dark tan on a white skin offers a sun protection factor of between 2 and 4. But more importantly, a tan is no defence against long-term UV damage such as skin cancer.Sunbeds mainly emit UVA radiation, which produces a tanning effect by increasing the amount of melanin pigment in the upper skin layers. Even though this is designed as a defence against further UV damage, the darkening as such provides little extra protection. UVB, on the other hand, stimulates cells to produce a thicker epidermis, which offers slightly more protection against further exposure to UV radiation."
What are the risks from sunbed use?,"Few studies have been undertaken to systematically assess the dangers of sunbed use, and the picture remains equivocal. Sunbeds for self-tanning purposes have been available for the last two decades and due to the long latency period for skin cancer and eye damage it has been difficult so far to demonstrate any long-term health effects.The majority of tanning parlours provide inadequate advice to their customers. The use of eye protection such as goggles or sunglasses should be mandatory. However, as sunbed users aim to have an even tan, they often decide against protecting any part of their body.Users have reported a range of short-term symptoms including itching, dryness and redness of skin, freckling and photosensitivity. Common outcomes in the longer term, especially in fair-skinned people, may involve blistering of the skin. Sagging and wrinkling of the skin are an almost certain price to be paid by frequent sunbed users."
Sunbed use as a melanoma time bomb?,"The new technology sunbeds are said to emit ""safe"" UV radiation. However, the original presumption that UVA is a safe form of UV radiation does not hold. If nothing else, it enhances skin ageing but, most likely, UVA also plays a role in skin cancer promotion. So what about the ""healthy tan"" that many manufacturers advertize? The results of a few simple measurements and calculations should suffice to put such claims into perspective:Average UVA levels of sunbeds easily reach midday solar UVA levels in the United Kingdom, but some sunbeds may exceed maximum values up to 20 times.UVB levels of sunbeds may be as low as 1/20 of the maximum solar UVB levels during the British summer, however, they may also exceed them threefold.Assuming the average UVA and UVB levels of the sunbeds tested, the carcinogenic effect of sunbed use over a period of 10 minutes corresponds with an exposure to 10 minutes of Mediterranean summer sun. Regular sunbed use therefore contributes significant amounts to the user's annual UV radiation exposure, especially as it involves whole-body exposure - the exposed skin area in sunbed tanning is at least twice as large as the average sunbather's.Even though the causes of malignant melanoma are not fully understood, tumour development appears to be linked to occasional exposure to intense sunlight. Curiously, tumours are most frequent on body sites that are rarely exposed to the sun. Sunbeds subject their users to intermittent high exposures of UVA and UVB radiation – this may provide the ideal setting for the development of malignant skin cancer. However, the few epidemiological studies that have been carried out to date have not provided any consistent results.Tanning beyond the normal complexion is associated with DNA damage in melanocytes, the cells that produce the dark-coloured melanin pigment in the skin. Even a small tanning effect requires a lot of DNA damage in the fair-skinned population. Therefore, regular use of sunbeds will significantly increase your chances of getting skin cancer if you are fair-skinned. The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection states that ""the use of sunbeds for cosmetic purposes is not recommended."" Regular exposure should not exceed two sessions per week with a maximum of 30 sessions per year. Australian cancer control organizations go even further, calling for tanning salons and advertizements for sunbeds to display health warnings – similar to those required on cigarette packets."
Who should never use sunbeds?,"People who:are under 18,have very fair skin,burn easily or tan poorlyhave a lot of freckles or moles,have had skin cancer or have a family history of the disease,are using medication that could make their skin more sensitive to UV, andare already have extensive ""sunlight"" damage"
What are microwaves?,"Microwaves are high frequency radio waves (radiofrequency fields) and, like visible radiation (light), are part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Microwaves are used primarily for TV broadcasting, radar for air and sea navigational aids, and telecommunications including mobile phones. They are also used in industry for processing materials, in medicine for diathermy treatment and in kitchens for cooking food.Microwaves are reflected, transmitted or absorbed by materials in their path, in a similar manner to light. Metallic materials totally reflect microwaves while non-metallic materials such as glass and some plastics are mostly transparent to microwaves.Materials containing water, for example foods, fluids or tissues, readily absorb microwave energy, which is then converted into heat. This Information Sheet discusses the operation and safety aspects of microwave ovens used in the home. More details about the nature of electromagnetic fields and health effects of radiofrequency and microwave fields are available in WHO Fact Sheets 182 and 183."
Are microwave ovens safe?,"When used according to manufacturers' instructions, microwave ovens are safe and convenient for heating and cooking a variety of foods. However, several precautions need to be taken, specifically with regards to potential exposure to microwaves, thermal burns and food handling.Microwave safety: The design of microwave ovens ensures that the microwaves are contained within the oven and can only be present when the oven is switched on and the door is shut. Leakage around and through the glass door is limited by design to a level well below that recommended by international standards. However, microwave leakage could still occur around damaged, dirty or modified microwave ovens. It is therefore important that the oven is maintained in good condition. Users should check that the door closes properly and that the safety interlock devices, fitted to the door to prevent microwaves from being generated while it is open, work correctly. The door seals should be kept clean and there should be no visible signs of damage to the seals or the outer casing of the oven. If any faults are found or parts of the oven are damaged, it should not be used until it has been repaired by an appropriately qualified service engineer.Microwave energy can be absorbed by the body and produce heat in exposed tissues. Organs with a poor blood supply and temperature control, such as the eye, or temperature-sensitive tissue like the testes, have a higher risk of heat damage. However, thermal damage would only occur from long exposures to very high power levels, well in excess of those measured around microwave ovens.Thermal safety: Burn injuries can result from handling hot items heated in a microwave oven, in the same way as items heated using conventional ovens or cooking surfaces. However, heating food in a microwave oven presents some peculiarities. Boiling water on a conventional stove allows steam to escape through bubbling action as the water begins to boil. In a microwave oven there may be no bubbles on the walls of the container and the water will super-heat and may suddenly boil. This sudden boiling may be triggered by a single bubble in the liquid or by the introduction of a foreign element such as a spoon. People have been severely burned by super-heated water.Another peculiarity of microwave cooking relates to the thermal response of specific foods. Certain items with non-porous surfaces (e.g. hotdogs) or composed of materials that heat at different rates (e.g. yolk and white of eggs) heat unevenly and may explode. This can happen if eggs or chestnuts are cooked in their shells.Food safety: Food safety is an important health issue. In a microwave oven, the rate of heating depends on the power rating of the oven and on the water content, density and amount of food being heated. Microwave energy does not penetrate well in thicker pieces of food, and may produce uneven cooking. This can lead to a health risk if parts of the food are not heated sufficiently to kill potentially dangerous micro-organisms. Because of the potential for uneven distribution of cooking, food heated in a microwave oven should rest for several minutes after cooking is completed to allow the heat to distribute throughout the food.Food cooked in a microwave oven is as safe, and has the same nutrient value, as food cooked in a conventional oven. The main difference between these two methods of cooking is that microwave energy penetrates deeper into the food and reduces the time for heat to be conducted throughout the food, thus reducing the overall cooking time.Only certain microwave ovens are designed to sterilize items (for example baby’s milk bottles). The user should follow the manufacturer's instructions for this type of application.Misconceptions: To dispel some misconceptions, it is important to realize that food cooked in a microwave oven does not become ""radioactive"". Nor does any microwave energy remain in the cavity or the food after the microwave oven is switched off. In this respect, microwaves act just like light; when the light bulb is turned off, no light remains."
How do microwave ovens work?,"Domestic microwave ovens operate at a frequency of 2450 MHz with a power usually ranging from 500 to 1100 watts. Microwaves are produced by an electronic tube called a magnetron. Once the oven is switched on, the microwaves are dispersed in the oven cavity and reflected by a stirrer fan so the microwaves are propagated in all directions. They are reflected by the metal sides of the oven cavity and absorbed by the food. Uniformity of heating in the food is usually assisted by having the food on a rotating turntable in the oven. Water molecules vibrate when they absorb microwave energy, and the friction between the molecules results in heating which cooks the food.Unlike conventional ovens, microwaves are absorbed only in the food and not in the surrounding oven cavity. Only dishes and containers specifically designed for microwave cooking should be used. Certain materials, such as plastics not suitable for microwave oven, may melt or burst into flames if overheated. Microwaves do not directly heat food containers which are designed for microwave cooking. These materials usually get warm only from being in contact with the hot food.Oven manufacturers do not recommend operating an empty oven. In the absence of food, the microwave energy can reflect back into the magnetron and may damage it.Microwave oven users should carefully read and comply with the manufacturer’s instructions because new ovens vary widely in design and performance. While most modern ovens can tolerate some food packaging made of metal, oven manufacturers generally recommend not placing metal in the oven, particularly not close to the walls, as this could cause electrical arcing and damage the oven walls. Also, because metal reflects microwaves, food wrapped in metal foil will not be cooked, while food not in metal wrap may receive more energy than intended, causing uneven cooking."
International standards,"Several countries, as well as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety (ICES) of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), have set a product emission limit of 50 watts per square metre (W/m2) at any point 5 cm away from the external surfaces of the oven. In practice, emissions from modern domestic microwave ovens are substantially below this international limit, and have interlocks that prevent people being exposed to microwaves while the oven is on. Moreover, exposure decreases rapidly with distance; e.g. a person 50 cm from the oven receives about one one-hundredth of the microwave exposure of a person 5 cm away.These product emission limits are defined for the purpose of compliance testing, not specifically exposure protection. The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) has published guidelines on exposure limits for the whole EMF part of the spectrum. Exposure guidelines in the microwave range are set at a level that prevents any known adverse health effect. Exposure limits for workers and for the general public are set well below levels where any hazardous heating occurs from microwave exposure. The emission limit for microwave ovens mentioned above is consistent with the exposure limits recommended by ICNIRP."
What is the World Health Organization doing?,"The World Health Organization (WHO), through the International EMF Project, has established a programme to review research results and conduct risk assessments of exposure to electromagnetic fields in the range from 0 to 300 GHz. Health risks from EMF exposure are being evaluated by WHO in collaboration with ICNIRP.The EMF Project has a web site with links to WHO Fact Sheets on various aspects of EMF exposure and health and published in multiple languages (for more information, see http://www.who.int/docstore/peh-emf/publications/facts_press/fact_english.htm). The site also provides information on the Project, its publications and its scientific and public information activities."
Is UV damage avoidable?,"UV damage is mostly avoidable. The rise in the incidence of skin cancers over the past decades is strongly related to increasingly popular outdoor activities and recreational exposure. Overexposure to sunlight is widely accepted as the underlying cause for harmful effects on the skin, eye and possibly the immune system. Many people consider intensive sunbathing to be normal – even if their skin doesn't. A tan may be cosmetically desirable and has established itself as a symbol of attractiveness and good health. But there is nothing healthy about a tan! It results from your skin trying to prevent further damage. Experts believe that four out of five cases of skin cancer could be prevented. And adopting simple precautions can make all the difference!"
How can I safely enjoy the sun?,"Too much sun is dangerous – but that does not mean that you cannot enjoy spending time outdoors. Just remember to follow a few simple rules. Stay out of the sun between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. during the summer months and when on holiday in a country closer to the equator. Rather than frying your skin on the beach at midday, you can safely enjoy the late afternoon hours without suffering a heat stroke and with a much reduced risk of getting burnt. Never fall asleep in the sun!Seek shade or create your own! Shade is shelter which reduces dangerous levels of UV and maintains a cool temperature to produce a comfortable summer environment, especially during the hottest part of the day. Move your outdoor activities to a shady spot, and take an umbrella to the beach. But keep in mind that shade structures such as trees, umbrellas or canopies do not offer complete sun protection. And don't forget that you may still experience high UV levels due to scattered radiation and ground reflection, especially in the snow or on the beach"
What are simple action steps for sun protection?,"Adopting the following simple precautions, adapted from the SunWise School Programme can make all the difference. Shade, clothing and hats provide the best protection – applying sunscreen becomes necessary on those parts of the body that remain exposed like the face and hands. Sunscreen should never be used to prolong the duration of sun exposure.Limit time in the midday sunThe sun's UV rays are the strongest between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. To the extent possible, limit exposure to the sun during these hours.Watch for the UV IndexThis important resource helps you plan your outdoor activities in ways that prevent overexposure to the sun's rays. While you should always take precautions against overexposure, take special care to adopt sun safety practices when the UV Index predicts exposure levels of moderate or above.Use shade wiselySeek shade when UV rays are the most intense, but keep in mind that shade structures such as trees, umbrellas or canopies do not offer complete sun protection. Remember the shadow rule: ""Watch your shadow – No shadow, seek shade!""Wear protective clothingA hat with a wide brim offers good sun protection for your eyes, ears, face, and the back or your neck. Sunglasses that provide 99 to 100 per cent UVA and UVB protection will greatly reduce eye damage from sun exposure. Tightly woven, loose fitting clothes will provide additional protection from the sun.Use sunscreenApply a broad-spectrum sunscreen of SPF 15+ liberally and re-apply every two hours, or after working, swimming, playing or exercising outdoors.Avoid sunlamps and tanning parloursSunbeds damage the skin and unprotected eyes and are best avoided entirely."
When is sun protection necessary?,"Time of yearYou should generally be careful between late spring and early autumn when the sun's rays are most intense.Time of dayLittle UV radiation reaches the Earth during early morning or late afternoon hours. But during the four-hour period around solar noon UV levels can be very high.Holiday timeThe average British indoor worker experiences 30 per cent of his annual UV radiation exposure during the summer holiday and another 40 per cent during summer weekends. The story is similar for most other Northern European countries. Therefore, it is particularly important that you protect yourself well during these times.Ground reflectionMake sure you protect yourself against UV when you go skiing, do water sports or spend extended time on the beach. Spending a whole day out in the open exposes you to a lot of UV radiation, especially under conditions of strong ground reflection."
Does sunscreen offer good protection?,"Sunscreens are a very effective way of protecting yourself against harmful effects from the sun. However, they should be used in combination with other methods such as sun avoidance and clothing. Remember that the aim of applying sunscreen is not to prolong your stay in the sun, but to protect the exposed parts of your body that are most at risk of getting damaged when you are out in the sun.Sunscreens may contain physical or chemical barriers against the sun's rays. While physical barriers reflect or scatter the UV rays, chemical barriers act by absorbing the UV radiation before it hits the skin. Today's sunscreens filter UV radiation in the UVA and the UVB range. The common SPF label on the tube stands for sun protection factor, a measure of how much UVB the sunscreen can block. The numbers range from 2 upwards. Unfortunately, to date there is no international standard to label the degree of protection from UVA."
What kind of sunscreen should I use?,"Always use a sunscreen that blocks out both UVA and UVB and has an SPF of 15 or higher. To achieve good protection: Apply the sunscreen thickly and evenly to all exposed parts of your body 15 minutes before going outside. Pay particular attention to the most exposed parts such as ears, nose, forehead and neck. You should re-apply the sunscreen every two hours, especially after swimming or other sporting activities. The use of a lip balm containing a sunscreen protects against recurrent lip eruptions of cold sores.A number of studies have shown that the vast majority of people do not apply sufficient amounts of sunscreen and therefore do not achieve the specified SPF. Approximately 35 ml of sunscreen must be applied to the total body surface of an adult to result in the SPF quoted on the tube. Hence as a rough guideline, one tube of sunscreen should last for approximately three whole-body applications. It is better to apply too much sunscreen than too little.Sunscreens are not to be confused with after-sun creams. After-sun lotions moisturize or soothe dry and sunburnt skin, but they neither protect against the sun's UV rays nor repair UV damage."
Is it true that clothing always provides good UV protection?,"Clothing provides the ideal barrier from the sun. In contrast to sunscreen lotion, clothing is relatively cheap and does not rub off. Cool, loose-fitting clothing and a wide-brimmed hat are the essentials for your summer sun protection kit. However, even through a garment, photodamage can occur. Against common belief, the simple see-through test is not good enough to assess the effectiveness of UV protective clothing and often turns out to be a pitfall. Clothing design, the type and structure of the fabric, its colour and tightness and whether the garment is wet or dry determine its effectiveness in protecting against UV radiation.Less UV passes through tightly woven or knitted fabrics.Darker colours usually block more UV radiation.Heavier weight fabrics usually block more UV radiation than lighter fabrics of the same type.Garments that are over-stretched, wet or worn out may lose some of their UV protection properties.Special UVA and UVB absorber additives applied during laundry can significantly improve protection.Over the past few years the concept of a so-called Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) has been introduced, and in some countries manufacturers include the UPF with their garment labelling. The UPF is a measure of the protection against UV radiation provided by an item of clothing, and is the equivalent of the sun protection factor or SPF for sunscreens. The higher the UPF value, the less UV radiation reaches the skin and the better the protection against sunburn and other harmful effects. Unfortunately, an international standard for the concept of the UPF has not been developed yet."
What are the right sunglasses?,"Just as with the skin, UV exposure to the eye is cumulative over a lifetime and may cause irreversible damage. Sunglasses help your vision and protect your eyes. They make you feel more comfortable under bright light conditions as they reduce glare and improve contrast. Most importantly, good sunglasses filter UVA and UVB radiation and can prevent damage to the eye.You cannot tell how much UV radiation a pair of sunglasses block based on the colour of the lenses, their darkness or their price. UV transmission through sunglasses varies considerably. However, most sunglasses on sale filter a large percentage of UV radiation. According to the American National Standards Institute, general purpose sunglasses must block between 60 and 92 per cent of visible light and UVA, and between 95 and 99 per cent of UVB.For sunglasses to be fully protective against UV radiation, the lenses must absorb all UV radiation and side protection should be provided. This is especially important in extreme UV environments, for example during hiking or climbing at altitude or skiing."
What should I take into account when I go travelling?,"UV radiation levels vary substantially with time and place. The increased risk of UV damage to the skin and eye during a holiday in a sunny location is often underestimated. Beyond the discomfort of sunburn, tourists are also at particular risk of long-term health effects on the eye and skin, especially skin ageing and skin cancer."
Are children particularly vulnerable?,"Yes, children are at a higher risk of suffering UV damage than adults, and therefore require special protection. A short time outdoors in the midday summer sun can result in serious burns – and even a single sunburn in childhood may significantly increase their skin cancer risk. Also, children have more time to develop diseases with long latency such as cancer, more years of life to be lost and more suffering to be endured as a result of impaired health.Children love playing outdoors and spend much more time in the sun than the average adult. Estimates suggest that the majority of a person's lifetime exposure to UV radiation is received before the age of 18."
How can I care for children in the sun?,"Children themselves are usually not aware of the harmful effects of UV – it is their parents' responsibility to protect their child from short-term and long-term damage.Always keep babies less than 12 months in the shade!Never let infants or young children sleep in the sun!Encourage your children to play in the shade!Make sure your children wear protective clothing, including a hat and sunglasses, when they go outdoors!Get your children used to wearing sunscreen!Apply sunscreen lotion generously! Pay particular attention to the most exposed body parts, the face, neck, shoulders, back, knees and tops of feet!Never allow children or teenagers to use sunlamps!"
What is ionizing radiation?,"Ionizing radiation is radiation with enough energy that to remove tightly bound electrons from the orbit of an atom, causing that atom to become charged or ionized.Here we are concerned with only one type of radiation, ionizing radiation, which occurs in two forms: waves or particles. There are several forms of electromagnetic radiation, which differ only in frequency and wavelength:heat wavesradio wavesinfrared lightvisible lightultraviolet lightX raysgamma rays.Longer wavelength, lower frequency waves such as heat and radio have less energy than shorter wavelength, higher frequency waves like X and gamma rays. Not all electromagnetic (EM) radiation is ionizing. Only the high frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which includes X rays and gamma rays, is ionizing."
What makes radiation wave-like?,"Most of the more familiar types of electromagnetic radiation, such as visible light and radio waves, exhibit “wave-like” behaviour in their interaction with matter. This energy is carried by oscillating electrical and magnetic fields that travel through space. This form of radiation is measurable though things like reflection and diffraction (ie: how particles pass around and through matter), and the transmission of radio signals that occurs when these waves transfer energy to the electrons in the material through which they are passing. These waves of electromagnetic radiation occur in packets called a photon. Photons are chargeless bundles of energy that travel in a vacuum at the speed of light, which is roughly 300 000 km/sec."
What is the particle form of radiation?,"Particulate radiation is a form of ionizing radiation. This consists of atomic or subatomic particles (electrons, protons, etc.) that carry kinetic energy, or mass in motion. This comes in several forms, including alpha and beta particles. Alpha particles and beta particles are considered directly ionizing because they carry a charge and can, therefore, interact directly with atomic electrons through coulombic forces (i.e. like charges repel each other; opposite charges attract each other).The neutron is an indirectly ionizing particle because it does not carry an electrical charge. Ionization is caused by charged particles, which are produced during collisions with atomic nuclei.The third type of ionizing radiation includes gamma and X rays, which are electromagnetic, indirectly ionizing radiation. These are indirectly ionizing because they are electrically neutral (as are all electromagnetic radiations) and do not interact with atomic electrons through coulombic forces."
What are isotopes?,"Atoms in their normal state are electrically neutral because the total negative charge of electrons outside the nucleus equals the total positive charge of the nucleus.Atoms with the same number of protons and different number of neutrons are called isotopes. An isotope may be defined as one, two or more forms of the same element having the same atomic number (Z), differing mass numbers (A) and the same chemical properties.These different forms of an element may be stable or unstable (radioactive). However, since they are forms of the same element, they possess identical chemical and biological properties.The simplest atom is the hydrogen atom. It has one electron orbiting a nucleus on one proton. Any atom with one proton in the nucleus is a hydrogen atom. Hydrogen-2 is called deuterium, hydrogen-3 is called tritium. However, while their chemical properties are identical their nuclear properties are quite different as only tritium is radioactive."
What does activity mean when discussing radioisotopes?,"The activity of a radioisotope is simply a measure of how many atoms undergo radioactive decay per a unit of time. The International System of Units (SI) unit for measuring the rate of nuclear transformations is the becquerel (Bq). The becquerel is defined as 1 radioactive disintegration per second.The old unit for this is the curie (Ci), in honour of Pierre and Marie Curie, who discovered radium and polonium. The curie is based on the activity of 1 gram of radium-226, i.e. 3.7 x 1010 radioactive disintegrations per second."
What is a dose of radiation and how is it measured?,"Only the energy from ionizing radiation that is imparted to (or absorbed by) the human body can cause harm to health. To understand its biological effects, we must know (or estimate) how much energy is deposited per unit mass of the part of our body with which the radiation is interacting.The international (SI) unit of measure for an absorbed dose is the gray (Gy), which is defined as 1 joule of energy deposited in 1 kilogram of mass. The old unit of measure for this is the rad, which stands for radiation absorbed dose. One gray is equal to 100 rads.The biological effect of this radiation depends not only on the amount of the absorbed dose but also on the intensity of the ionization in the living cells caused by different types of radiation. This is known as the equivalent dose. For example, neutron, proton and alpha radiation can cause 5-20 times more harm than the same amount of the absorbed dose of beta or gamma radiation.The unit of equivalent dose is the sievert (Sv). The old unit of measure is the rem. One sievert is equal to 100 rems."
What are the sources of radiation exposure?,"Radiation is permanently present throughout the environment - in the air, water, food, soil and in all living organisms. In fact, a large proportion of the average annual radiation dose received by people results from natural environmental sources.Each person is exposed to an average of 2.4 mSv per year of ionizing radiation from natural sources. In some areas around the world the natural radiation dose may be 5 to 10-times higher for large number of people."
What is the current risk of radiation-related health problems in Japan for those residing near the reactor in comparison to those in other parts of Japan?,"During the early phase of the nuclear emergency radiation-related health were dependant on exposure, which is turn were due to several things, including: the amount and type of radiation released from the reactor; weather conditions, such as wind and rain; a person’s proximity to the plant; and the amount of time spent in irradiated areas.The Government of Japan’s early actions in response to events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were in line with the existing recommendations for radiation exposure. The Government has evacuated individuals who were living within a 20-kilometre radius around the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Those living between 20 km and 30 km from the plant were asked to evacuate voluntarily. In general, people living farther away of the site of the event are at lower risk than those who live nearby.In light of evolving new information on levels of environmental radioactivity in the 20-30 km zone and some surrounding areas beyond the 30km zone, the Government of Japan established new planned evacuation zones from which residents were relocated to temporary housing based on the estimated cumulative doses they may receive in the 1 year following the accident.In addition, an emergency evacuation preparedness zone was also identified in which residents were asked to prepare their affairs in case they were asked to evacuate. These zones also follow administrative boundaries and extend beyond the 30 km radius."
Is there a risk of radioactive exposure from food contamination?,"Yes, there is a risk of exposure as a result of contamination in food. However, contaminated food would have to be consumed over prolonged periods to represent a risk to human health.The radioactive iodine and caesium in concentrations above the Japanese regulatory limits have been detected in some food commodities as a result of food monitoring. Japanese authorities have advised residents to avoid these food and have implemented measures to prevent their sale and distribution."
Are there health risks to people living outside of Japan from radiation emitted into the atmosphere from damaged Japanese nuclear power plants?,"Thus far, there are no health risks to people living in other countries from radioactive material released into the atmosphere from the Japanese nuclear power plants. Radiation levels measured to date in other countries are far below the level of background radiation that most people are exposed to in every day circumstances.Radiation levels have been monitored by the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), which operates 63 surveillance stations around the world.Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO)"
What is ionizing radiation?,"When certain atoms disintegrate, they release a type of energy called ionizing radiation. This energy can travel as either electromagnetic waves (i.e. gamma or X-rays) or as particles (i.e. alpha, beta or neutrons).The atoms that emit radiation are called radionuclides; e.g., radioactive iodine, caesium, and plutonium. Ionizing radiation is an essential tool for diagnosis and treatment in medicine, that must be used with rigorous attention to safety."
Are people normally exposed to ionizing radiation?,"Human beings are exposed to natural radiation (also known as background radiation) on a daily basis. Natural radiation comes from space (i.e. cosmic rays) as well as from naturally-occurring radioactive materials found in the soil, water and air. Radon gas is a naturally-occurring gas that is the main source of natural radiation.People can also be exposed to radiation from man-made sources. Today, the most common man-made sources of ionizing radiation are X-ray machines and other medical devices.Radiation doses can be expressed in Sievert (Sv) units. On average, a person is exposed to approximately 3.0 milli Sieverts (mSv)/year, of which 80% (2.4 mSv) is due to naturally-occurring sources (i.e., background radiation), 19.6 % (almost 0.6 mSv) is due to the medical use of radiation and the remaining 0.4% (around 0.01 mSv) is due to other sources of human-made radiation.In some parts of the world, levels of exposure to natural radiation differ due to local geology. People in some areas can be exposed to more than 200 times the global average."
How are people exposed to ionizing radiation?,"Ionizing radiation may result from sources outside or inside of the body (i.e. external irradiation or internal contamination). External irradiation is produced when a person is exposed to external sources (i.e. X-rays) or when radioactive material (i.e. dust, liquid, or aerosols) becomes attached to skin or clothes. Internal contamination may result from breathing in or swallowing radioactive material or through contamination of wounds."
What type of radiation exposure could occur in a nuclear power plant accident?,"In the event a nuclear power plant does not function properly, individuals, land, and structures in the vicinity of the plant could be exposed to a mixture of radioactive products generated inside the reactor, also known as “nuclear fission products”. The main radionuclides representing health risk are radioactive caesium and radioactive iodine.Members of the public may be exposed directly to radionuclides, either in the air or if food and water become contaminated by these materials.Rescuers, first responders, and nuclear power plant workers may be exposed to radioactive materials and higher radiation doses inside or around the power plant due to their professional activities."
What is the WHO travel advice for Japan?,"WHO has not issued an advise on general restrictions regarding travel to Japan.During the early phase of the emergency, travellers were advised to avoid travel to the areas most affected by the earthquake and tsunami because of disruptions to essential services, such as transport and electric power. The ongoing disaster relief activities, including the nuclear power plant emergency response and control activities, would have made travel difficult and could have consumed resources needed by relief workers and residents. Moreover, as indicated by the Japanese authorities, travel within the evacuation and exclusion zones surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was prohibited.In general, travellers who do not have essential reasons to travel were advised to give careful consideration to deferring travel to any areas where there had been considerable disruption to the normal infrastructure and where authorities were responding to urgent humanitarian needs.The situation in Japan has improved. Residents are being temporary allowed access into some areas that had been evacuated, but restrictions still exist. The Government of Japan is monitoring the situation and plans to lift restrictions once safety conditions are met.Information on the status of the nuclear facilities in Fukushima can be found on Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) website and on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) website.Travellers should be aware of the risk of further earthquakes across Japan. Moreover, there may be areas of power, fuel, food and water shortages.International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)"
Do travellers returning from Japan represent a health risk for others?,"At this time, only those involved in the emergency response near the nuclear power plant remain in the area where there are higher levels of radioactivity. For their own safety, all personnel in these areas should undergo decontamination procedures when they leave the site. Travellers returning from Japan who have come from the 20 km evacuation zone surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and who have undergone proper screening and decontamination procedures, and travellers from all other areas, do not pose a radioactive health risk to others and do not require screening."
What are the acute health effects of radiation exposure?,"If the dose of radiation exceeds a certain threshold level, it can produce acute effects, including skin redness, hair loss, radiation burns, and acute radiation syndrome (ARS).In a nuclear power plant accident, the general population is not likely to be exposed to doses high enough to cause such effects.Rescuers, first responders, and nuclear power plant workers are more likely to be exposed to doses of radiation high enough to cause acute effects."
What long-term effects can be expected from radiation exposure?,"Exposure to ionizing doses of radiation can increase the risk of cancer.Radioactive iodine can be released during nuclear emergencies. If radioactive iodine is breathed in or swallowed, it will concentrate in the thyroid gland and increase the risk of thyroid cancer. Among persons exposed to radioactive iodine, the risk of thyroid cancer can be lowered by taking potassium iodide pills, which helps prevent the uptake of the radioactive iodine.The risk of thyroid cancer following radiation exposure is higher in children and young adults."
Does radiation exposure pose a risk to foetuses?,"Foetuses are at risk of brain damage from radiation during weeks 8-25 of gestation.Studies have shown brain damage in foetuses following exposure to an acute dose of radiation exceeding 100 mSv during weeks 8-15 and an acute dose exceeding 200 mSv during weeks 16-25. Outside of weeks 8-25, studies have not shown radiation risk to the fetal brain.Foetal exposure to radiation can increase the risk of cancer in childhood. Studies have shown this effect with doses above 100 mSv.Dose comparisons for ionising radiationHealth Protection Agency (UK) web site"
What emotional impact can a nuclear accident have on children?How can they be assisted?,"Disasters and their aftermath can have a profound emotional impact on children and may result in long term behavioural disturbances. Children exhibiting signs of stress - including difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, developing new fears, changes in behavior (e.g. clinging, bedwetting), being preoccupied with the crisis - should receive extra time and attention from family members and other caregivers.Children are among the most vulnerable of those affected by a nuclear accident because of their inability to fully understand and process the immediate and long-term effects of the emergency. Family members and caregivers should try to find out what the child thinks and feels about the disaster. If the child is scared because she/he has misunderstood what has happened, then simple explanations should be provided while avoiding alarming details. Children need a chance to play and relax. Encourage older children to be helpful and maintain regular routines.Reactions to stress can depend on developmental level and are generally marked by changes in typical behavior for a specific child or adolescent. Reactions may continue for days, weeks or even months. Children should see a paediatrician or mental health professional if anxiety or grief interferes with their daily functioning, or if these emotions do not reduce with time. Early management of these symptoms can speed recovery and prevent long-term consequences.Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency SettingsInter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) GuidelinesTriage, Monitoring and Treatment of people exposed to ionizing radiationTMT Hand book Triage, Monitoring and Treatment of people exposed to ionizing radiation following a malevolent act (2009). WHO, SCK, NRPA, STUK, Enviros, Clor. Chapter 8: 328 - 331 Prevention and treatment of psychological consequences"
Which public health actions are most important to take?,"Health effects can only occur if someone is exposed to radiation, thus the main protective action someone can take is to prevent exposure. Those closest to the radiation source are at greatest risk of exposure and the greater the distance away, the lower the risk.In the early phase of a nuclear emergency (within the first hours/days), urgent protective actions may be implemented to prevent radiation exposure, taking into account projected doses that people may received in the short-term (e.g. within 2-7 days). These necessary actions depend on the estimated exposure (i.e., the amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere and the prevailing meteorological conditions, such as wind and rain. Actions may include: evacuation of the area around or near the nuclear power plant; advising people to shelter in their homes, offices, other secure buildings or designated shelters to reduce exposure; and distributing and administering potassium iodide pills to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer).When environmental and human monitoring data increases, relocation of people to temporary housing may be considered in particular areas, taking into account the radiation doses that residents may receive over the long-term (e.g. one year).If warranted, public health or national authorities may restrict or prohibit the consumption of vegetables and dairy products produced in the vicinity of the nuclear power plant in order to reduce exposure. Monitoring programs are established to inform longer term decisions on food restriction, water consumption, and the control of internationally traded foodstuffs.Only competent authorities who have conducted a careful analysis of the emergency situation are in a position to recommend which of these public health measures should be undertaken."
How can I protect myself?,"Keep informed by obtaining accurate and authoritative information (e.g., information from authorities delivered by radio, TV or the Internet) and following your government's instructions.The decision to take potassium iodide should be based on information provided by national health authorities who will be in the best position to determine if this step is warranted."
"If I have been exposed to radioactive material released into the environment, what should I do?","If you are coming indoors after exposure to radioactive material, undress in the doorway to avoid further contamination in your home or shelter. Remove clothing and shoes and place them in a plastic bag. Seal the bag and place it in a safe location away from living areas, children, and pets.Shower or bathe with warm water and soap.Notify authorities that you may have contaminated clothing and personal belongings to be handled appropriately and disposed of according to accepted national procedures."
"When people are advised to stay indoors, what does this mean?","When a radiological or nuclear event occurs, public health authorities may order residents in the affected areas to stay indoors rather than evacuate. You may be advised to take shelter at home, at work, or in public shelters. Shelter can provide protection from external exposure and from inhalation of radioactive material.If you are advised to stay indoors, you should find the safest room in your house or office building: if possible, one which has no windows and no external doors. Ventilation systems, such as heating and cooling systems, should be shut down.In sub-zero temperatures, it is important to keep warm. If you have been instructed to shelter in your home, office, or other structure, it may not be safe to burn fuels—such as gas, coal, or wood—to keep warm. Doing so may result in carbon monoxide poisoning, which can occur when rooms are not adequately ventilated. If it is available, electrical forms of heating are safer."
What are potassium iodide pills?,"Potassium iodide pills are a source of stable (i.e. non-radioactive) iodine. The thyroid gland requires iodine to produce thyroid hormones. The presence of stable iodine in the body in an appropriate amount blocks the thyroid from absorbing radioactive iodine (radioiodine), reducing the risk of thyroid cancer which may follow from exposure to radioiodine.Potassium iodide pills are not “radiation antidotes”. They do not protect against external radiation, or against any other radioactive substances besides radioiodine. They may also cause medical complications for some individuals with poorly functioning kidneys. Potassium iodide should be taken only when there is a clear public health recommendation."
When and why should I take potassium iodide?,"You should only take potassium iodide when it is recommended by public health authorities. If you are at risk or have been exposed to radioiodine, potassium iodide pills may be given to protect the thyroid gland from uptake of radioiodine. This can reduce the risk of thyroid cancer in the long run, when given before or shortly after exposure."
Should I take iodized salt to protect myself from radiation?,"No, you should not take iodized salt to protect yourself from radiation. It is dangerous to take large amounts of iodized salt in order to increase the amount of stable iodine in the body.Increasing one's daily intake of iodized salt will cause more harm than good. The main ingredient of iodized salt is sodium chloride, which is linked with hypertension (high blood pressure) and other medical disorders. The iodine content in iodized salt is too low to prevent uptake of radioiodine.Sodium chloride is acutely toxic in large amounts: even tablespoon quantities of salt repeatedly taken over a short period of time could cause poisoning."
Can I take other forms of iodine?,"No, you should not take products that contain iodine, other than medicines recommended by public health authorities.Iodine is found in a variety of household and industrial products. For example, iodine may be found in some disinfectants, antiseptics, and water-sterilizing solutions. These products should not be taken as an alternative to potassium iodide pills, because such products contain other ingredients that can be harmful if swallowed."
Can pregnant women take potassium iodide pills?,"Yes, most pregnant women can take potassium iodide pills, following the instructions of public health authorities. Potassium iodide will cross the placenta and protect the thyroid of the growing foetus, as well as the mother."
What are the recommendations for breastfeeding women regarding potassium iodide?,"As with the rest of the population, breastfeeding women should take potassium iodide tablets only when advised by public health authorities. However, this will not be sufficient to fully protect the breastfed child who will need potassium iodide as well, in special doses adapted for newborns and infants.Under these conditions, breastfeeding can continue."
Can food produced in other countries be affected by the events in Japan?,"The damage to the Daiichi nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Japan, and the subsequent detection of radioactivity in certain food samples from neighbouring areas have raised concerns about the safety of food from Japan. The Japanese authorities have regulations in place relating to provisional regulatory limits of radioactivity in food and food monitoring is being implemented. Measurements of radionuclide concentrations in food have been taking place and are being released by the Japanese authorities.These food safety-related questions and answers produced by the FAO and WHO address some of the international concerns over the safety of food produced in Japan.Radioactive material has been released into the environment from damaged Japanese nuclear power plants. Radiation levels measured to date in other countries are far below the level of background radiation that most people are exposed to in every day circumstances and do not present health or transportation safety hazards, according to the United Nations organizations closely monitoring the situation.Minute amounts of radioactive caesium and iodine might be found using very sensitive detection methods but this should not affect foods produced in other countries as the amounts involved will be well below acceptable levels and would not pose a health concern to those who eat the food."
What are the potential health effects of consuming contaminated food?,"Consuming food contaminated with radioactive material will increase the amount of radioactivity a person is exposed to and could increase the health risks associated with exposure to radiation. The exact effect will depend on which radionuclides have been ingested and the amount. According to data reported so far, radioactive iodine and caesium are the main contaminants, and concentrations in some food samples have been detected at levels above the Japanese regulatory limits.Radioactive iodine has a half-life of eight days and decays naturally within weeks. If ingested, it can accumulate in the body, particularly the thyroid gland, and increase the risk of thyroid cancer, particularly in children.The ingestion of potassium iodide is an established method to prevent the accumulation of radioactive iodine in the thyroid.Radioactive caesium has a half-life longer than that of radioactive iodine (up to 30 years).and can stay in the environment for many years. Like all radionuclides, exposure to radiation from radioactive caesium can result in a increased risk of cancer."
Is all food production in Japan affected by the nuclear emergency?,"No, not all foods will be affected. Food that was dispatched or commercially packaged before the emergency situation would not be affected. However, some food produced in areas where radioactive material has been deposited has been found to be contaminated. This is why the Japanese authorities have instituted monitoring and are taking measures to address the issue."
What impact will this have on food and food production in Japan?,"The impact on food and food production in Japan will depend upon the types of radionuclides and the amount of radioactivity deposited or present where food is being produced or harvested. Although radioactive iodine in food is of immediate concern after nuclear emergencies, it has a relatively short half-life and will naturally decay over a short time frame. Radioactive caesium has also been detected in food. In contrast to radioactive iodine, radioactive caesium can linger in the environment for many years and could continue to present a longer term problem for food, and food production, and a threat to human health."
How do food products become radioactive?,"Foods can become contaminated with radioactive materials when they are released as the result of a nuclear or radiological emergency. In these circumstances, radioactive material falling from the air or carried in rain water or snow, can deposit on the surface of foods like fruits and vegetables or animal feed. Also, over time, radioactivity can build up within food, as radionuclides are transferred through soil into crops or animals. Radioactivity can also be washed into rivers, lakes and the sea where fish and seafood could take up the radionuclides. The severity of the risk depends on the radionuclide mix and the level of contaminant released.Radioactivity cannot contaminate food that is packaged; for example, tinned or plastic-wrapped food is protected from radioactivity as long as the food is sealed."
Why is food affected in areas beyond the evacuation zone?,"During a nuclear emergency, an evacuation zone is established to prevent people from being exposed to immediate and unacceptable levels of radiation posing a threat to human health. However, contamination of food can occur through uptake from soil to crops, or to animals through feed, even when levels of radioactive contamination are lower than those which might pose a direct threat to human health. The standards for acceptable limits for radioactivity in food are set at low levels in order to take into account the possibility of contaminated food being eaten over an extended period of time and resulting in a cumulative dose."
Are there rules for radioactivity in foods for international trade?,"There are internationally agreed Codex Guideline Levels (GLs) for radionuclide levels in internationally traded food following a nuclear or radiological emergency. These GLs are published by the Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission.The GLs state that, “as far as generic radiological protection of food consumers is concerned, when radionuclide levels in food do not exceed the corresponding Guideline Level, the food should be considered as safe for human consumption. When the Guideline Levels are exceeded, national governments shall decide whether and under what circumstances the food should be distributed within their territory or jurisdiction. National governments may wish to adopt different values for internal use within their own territories, where the assumptions concerning food distribution that have been made to derive the Guideline Levels may not apply, e.g., in the case of widespread radioactive contamination. For foods that are consumed in small quantities, such as spices, that represent a small percentage of total diet and hence a small addition to the total dose, the Guideline Levels may be increased by a factor of 10”.GLs for radionuclide levels can be found in the Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food and Feed – (CODEX STAN 193-1995)Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food and Feed [pdf, 617KB](CODEX STAN 193-1995)"
What actions are being taken to monitor the safety of food from Japan?,"In response to the nuclear accident in Japan, Japanese authorities have instituted monitoring of food products and have restricted the consumption and distribution of some products in certain prefectures, or areas found to contain radionuclides exceeding Japan's provisional regulation value. Findings from food monitoring in Japan and decisions related to the consumption and distribution of food products are published regularly on the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare web site.Many countries have implemented food control measures to mirror actions taken within Japan. Some countries have indicated they now require documentation verifying the safety of products and/or the prefecture of origin of the food. Other countries have suspended food imports from Japan. In addition, many countries have increased monitoring on foods imported from Japan.Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare"
What general advice can be given to food consumers and producers in the event of a nuclear emergency?,"The response to an emergency involving radioactivity should be the same as the response to any emergency involving any hazardous material contaminating food. In the early stages of an emergency, and if it is safe to do so, it is possible to take immediate actions to prevent or minimize the contamination of food by radiological materials. For example, it is possible to do the following:protect food and animal fodder which is stored in the open; cover with plastic sheets or impermeable tarpaulins;close the ventilation of greenhouses to protect growing vegetables;bring livestock in from pastures and move animals into a shed or barn;harvest any ripe crops and place under cover before any fallout has been recorded; anddon’t harvest after fallout – wait for further instructions after contamination has been recorded.Many other short-, medium- and long-term actions need to be considered in areas confirmed to be seriously contaminated, such as:avoid consumption of locally produced milk or vegetables;avoid slaughtering animals;avoid consumption and harvesting of aquatic animals and plants (including fish, shellfish, and algae); andavoid hunting or gathering mushrooms or other wild or collected foods.Additional information on emergency preparedness and responseJoint FAO/IAEA Programme"
What are electromagnetic fields and where do they come from?,"Electric fields are created by differences in voltage: the higher the voltage, the stronger will be the resultant field. Magnetic fields are created when electric current flows: the greater the current, the stronger the magnetic field. An electric field will exist even when there is no current flowing. If current does flow, the strength of the magnetic field will vary with power consumption but the electric field strength will be constant.Natural sources of electromagnetic fieldsElectromagnetic fields are present everywhere in our environment but are invisible to the human eye. Electric fields are produced by the local build-up of electric charges in the atmosphere associated with thunderstorms. The earth's magnetic field causes a compass needle to orient in a North-South direction and is used by birds and fish for navigation.Human-made sources of electromagnetic fieldsBesides natural sources the electromagnetic spectrum also includes fields generated by human-made sources: X-rays are employed to diagnose a broken limb after a sport accident. The electricity that comes out of every power socket has associated low frequency electromagnetic fields. And various kinds of higher frequency radiowaves are used to transmit information – whether via TV antennas, radio stations or mobile phone base stations."
Can I drink the tap water in Japan?,"Drinking tap water in Japan poses no immediate health risk.The Japanese authorities closely monitored the situation and issued advice, when needed, against consumption of tap water, including specific recommendations for infants. Essential hydration of infants should not be compromised in an attempt to reduce exposure to radionuclide contamination.The standards adopted by the Japanese authorities for this emergency are precautionary. In the case of radioactive iodine the standard for adults is 300 Becquerels per litre in drinking-water. In the very unlikely scenario that drinking-water was contaminated and consumed for an entire year at this level, the additional radiation exposure from this water would be equivalent to natural background radiation during one year.During the early phase of the emergency WHO urged people in the area to heed the advice of local authorities, as they have access to the latest measurements of radiation levels in water to compare against the standards for adults and children. Currently, restrictions of consumption of tap water have been lifted in all prefectures"
Can radioactive contamination be removed from water?,Standard water treatment procedures may remove significant amounts of radioactive contaminants. Other options to reduce concentrations of radiation contaminants include controlled dilution of contaminated water with non-contaminated water.Boiling water will not remove radioactive iodine.
Why do the guidance levels for radioactive Iodine-131 in drinking water vary?,"The guidance levels found in different sets of recommendations vary because some apply to routine situations and others to emergency situations. The table below summarizes the guidance on radioactive Iodine-131 in drinking water and provides an indication
    of the equivalent exposure from routine activities.Guideline nameAdvised maximum levels for radioactive activity in water (Bq/L)Approximate equivalent radiation exposure if consuming water at this activity level for a yearWHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (1)10A New York - London flightJapanese provisional (emergency) standard for adults (2)300One year's exposure to natural background radiation, or 10-15 chest X-raysJapanese provisional (emergency) standard for infants (3)100IAEA Operational Intervention Level for nuclear emergencies (4)3000Not applicable. The advised maximum level should be used only to trigger action in the early stages of the emergency(1) WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality should not be taken as the reference point for nuclear emergencies because the levels set are extremely conservative, and designed to apply to lifetime routine intake.(2) Provisional regulation values relating to limits on food and drink ingestion, established by the Japanese Food Sanitation Act, as indicated by the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan. These standards are precautionary and have taken international guidance
    into consideration, including recommendations of the IAEA and the International Commission on Radiological Protection.(3) As in (2) above, but applicable to drinking-water used to prepare baby food. This level is equivalent to the international guideline set by Codex Alimentarius for infant food.(4) IAEA Safety Guide GSG-2 established Operational Intervention Levels (OILs) which would be the default international guidance levels for the early stage of an emergency."
What is WHO's role in nuclear emergencies?,"In accordance with its Constitution and the International Health Regulations, WHO is mandated to assess public health risks and provide technical consultation and assistance in association with public health events, including those associated with radiation events. In doing so, WHO is working with independent experts and other UN agencies.WHO's work is supported by a global network comprising more than 40 specialized institutions in radiation emergency medicine. The network, the Radiation Emergency Medical Preparedness and Assistance Network (REMPAN), provides technical assistance for radiation emergency preparedness and response."
What makes the various forms of electromagnetic fields so different?,"One of the main characteristics which defines an electromagnetic field (EMF) is its frequency or its corresponding wavelength. Fields of different frequencies interact with the body in different ways. One can imagine electromagnetic waves as series of very regular waves that travel at an enormous speed, the speed of light. The frequency simply describes the number of oscillations or cycles per second, while the term wavelength describes the distance between one wave and the next. Hence wavelength and frequency are inseparably intertwined: the higher the frequency the shorter the wavelength.A simple analogy should help to illustrate the concept: Tie a long rope to a door handle and keep hold of the free end. Moving it up and then down slowly will generate a single big wave; more rapid motion will generate a whole series of small waves. The length of the rope remains constant, therefore, the more waves you generate (higher frequency) the smaller will be the distance between them (shorter wavelength)."
What happens when you are exposed to electromagnetic fields?,"Exposure to electromagnetic fields is not a new phenomenon. However, during the 20th century, environmental exposure to man-made electromagnetic fields has been steadily increasing as growing electricity demand, ever-advancing technologies and changes in social behaviour have created more and more artificial sources. Everyone is exposed to a complex mix of weak electric and magnetic fields, both at home and at work, from the generation and transmission of electricity, domestic appliances and industrial equipment, to telecommunications and broadcasting.Tiny electrical currents exist in the human body due to the chemical reactions that occur as part of the normal bodily functions, even in the absence of external electric fields. For example, nerves relay signals by transmitting electric impulses. Most biochemical reactions from digestion to brain activities go along with the rearrangement of charged particles. Even the heart is electrically active - an activity that your doctor can trace with the help of an electrocardiogram.Low-frequency electric fields influence the human body just as they influence any other material made up of charged particles. When electric fields act on conductive materials, they influence the distribution of electric charges at their surface. They cause current to flow through the body to the ground.Low-frequency magnetic fields induce circulating currents within the human body. The strength of these currents depends on the intensity of the outside magnetic field. If sufficiently large, these currents could cause stimulation of nerves and muscles or affect other biological processes.Both electric and magnetic fields induce voltages and currents in the body but even directly beneath a high voltage transmission line, the induced currents are very small compared to thresholds for producing shock and other electrical effects.Heating is the main biological effect of the electromagnetic fields of radiofrequency fields. In microwave ovens this fact is employed to warm up food. The levels of radiofrequency fields to which people are normally exposed are very much lower than those needed to produce significant heating. The heating effect of radiowaves forms the underlying basis for current guidelines. Scientists are also investigating the possibility that effects below the threshold level for body heating occur as a result of long-term exposure. To date, no adverse health effects from low level, long-term exposure to radiofrequency or power frequency fields have been confirmed, but scientists are actively continuing to research this area."
Biological effects or health effects? What is a health hazard?,"Biological effects are measurable responses to a stimulus or to a change in the environment. These changes are not necessarily harmful to your health. For example, listening to music, reading a book, eating an apple or playing tennis will produce a range of biological effects. Nevertheless, none of these activities is expected to cause health effects. The body has sophisticated mechanisms to adjust to the many and varied influences we encounter in our environment. Ongoing change forms a normal part of our lives. But, of course, the body does not possess adequate compensation mechanisms for all biological effects. Changes that are irreversible and stress the system for long periods of time may constitute a health hazard.An adverse health effect causes detectable impairment of the health of the exposed individual or of his or her offspring; a biological effect, on the other hand, may or may not result in an adverse health effect.It is not disputed that electromagnetic fields above certain levels can trigger biological effects. Experiments with healthy volunteers indicate that short-term exposure at the levels present in the environment or in the home do not cause any apparent detrimental effects. Exposures to higher levels that might be harmful are restricted by national and international guidelines. The current debate is centred on whether long-term low level exposure can evoke biological responses and influence people's well being.Widespread concerns for healthA look at the news headlines of recent years allows some insight into the various areas of public concern. Over the course of the past decade, numerous electromagnetic field sources have become the focus of health concerns, including power lines, microwave ovens, computer and TV screens, security devices, radars and most recently mobile phones and their base stations.The International EMF ProjectIn response to growing public health concerns over possible health effects from exposure to an ever increasing number and diversity of electromagnetic field sources, in 1996 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a large, multidisciplinary research effort. The International EMF Project brings together current knowledge and available resources of key international and national agencies and scientific institutions.Conclusions from scientific researchIn the area of biological effects and medical applications of non-ionizing radiation approximately 25,000 articles have been published over the past 30 years. Despite the feeling of some people that more research needs to be done, scientific knowledge in this area is now more extensive than for most chemicals. Based on a recent in-depth review of the scientific literature, the WHO concluded that current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields. However, some gaps in knowledge about biological effects exist and need further research.Effects on general healthSome members of the public have attributed a diffuse collection of symptoms to low levels of exposure to electromagnetic fields at home. Reported symptoms include headaches, anxiety, suicide and depression, nausea, fatigue and loss of libido. To date, scientific evidence does not support a link between these symptoms and exposure to electromagnetic fields. At least some of these health problems may be caused by noise or other factors in the environment, or by anxiety related to the presence of new technologies.Effects on pregnancy outcomeMany different sources and exposures to electromagnetic fields in the living and working environment, including computer screens, water beds and electric blankets, radiofrequency welding machines, diathermy equipment and radar, have been evaluated by the WHO and other organizations. The overall weight of evidence shows that exposure to fields at typical environmental levels does not increase the risk of any adverse outcome such as spontaneous abortions, malformations, low birth weight, and congenital diseases. There have been occasional reports of associations between health problems and presumed exposure to electromagnetic fields, such as reports of prematurity and low birth weight in children of workers in the electronics industry, but these have not been regarded by the scientific community as being necessarily caused by the field exposures (as opposed to factors such as exposure to solvents).CataractsGeneral eye irritation and cataracts have sometimes been reported in workers exposed to high levels of radiofrequency and microwave radiation, but animal studies do not support the idea that such forms of eye damage can be produced at levels that are not thermally hazardous. There is no evidence that these effects occur at levels experienced by the general public.Electromagnetic fields and cancerDespite many studies, the evidence for any effect remains highly controversial. However, it is clear that if electromagnetic fields do have an effect on cancer, then any increase in risk will be extremely small. The results to date contain many inconsistencies, but no large increases in risk have been found for any cancer in children or adults.A number of epidemiological studies suggest small increases in risk of childhood leukemia with exposure to low frequency magnetic fields in the home. However, scientists have not generally concluded that these results indicate a cause-effect relation between exposure to the fields and disease (as opposed to artifacts in the study or effects unrelated to field exposure). In part, this conclusion has been reached because animal and laboratory studies fail to demonstrate any reproducible effects that are consistent with the hypothesis that fields cause or promote cancer. Large-scale studies are currently underway in several countries and may help resolve these issues.Electromagnetic hypersensitivity and depressionSome individuals report ""hypersensitivity"" to electric or magnetic fields. They ask whether aches and pains, headaches, depression, lethargy, sleeping disorders, and even convulsions and epileptic seizures could be associated with electromagnetic field exposure.There is little scientific evidence to support the idea of electromagnetic hypersensitivity. Recent Scandinavian studies found that individuals do not show consistent reactions under properly controlled conditions of electromagnetic field exposure. Nor is there any accepted biological mechanism to explain hypersensitivity. Research on this subject is difficult because many other subjective responses may be involved, apart from direct effects of fields themselves. More studies are continuing on the subject.The focus of current and future researchMuch effort is currently being directed towards the study of electromagnetic fields in relation to cancer. Studies in search for possible carcinogenic (cancer-producing) effects of power frequency fields is continuing, although at a reduced level compared to that of the late 1990's.The long-term health effects of mobile telephone use is another topic of much current research. No obvious adverse effect of exposure to low level radiofrequency fields has been discovered. However, given public concerns regarding the safety of cellular telephones, further research aims to determine whether any less obvious effects might occur at very low exposure levels.Key pointsA wide range of environmental influences causes biological effects. 'Biological effect' does not equal 'health hazard'. Special research is needed to identify and measure health hazards.At low frequencies, external electric and magnetic fields induce small circulating currents within the body. In virtually all ordinary environments, the levels of induced currents inside the body are too small to produce obvious effects.The main effect of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields is heating of body tissues.There is no doubt that short-term exposure to very high levels of electromagnetic fields can be harmful to health. Current public concern focuses on possible long-term health effects caused by exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below those required to trigger acute biological responses.WHO's International EMF Project was launched to provide scientifically sound and objective answers to public concerns about possible hazards of low level electromagnetic fields.Despite extensive research, to date there is no evidence to conclude that exposure to low level electromagnetic fields is harmful to human health.The focus of international research is the investigation of possible links between cancer and electromagnetic fields, at power line and radiofrequencies."
What is the current state of research?,"If electromagnetic fields constitute a health hazard, there will be consequences in all industrialized countries. The public demands concrete answers to the ever more pressing question, whether everyday electromagnetic fields cause adverse health effects. The media often seem to have definitive answers. However, one should judge these reports with caution and take into account that the primary interest of the media is not education. A journalist may select and report a story driven by a range of non-technical reasons: journalists compete with one another for time and space and different journals and newspapers compete for circulation numbers. Novel sensational headlines that are relevant to as many people as possible aid them in achieving these goals - bad news is not only the big news, it is often the only news we hear. The large number of studies which suggest that electromagnetic fields are harmless receive little if any coverage. Science cannot provide a guarantee of absolute safety yet but the development of research is reassuring overall.Different types of studies are neededA mix of studies in different research areas is essential for the evaluation of a potential adverse health effect of electromagnetic fields. Different types of studies investigate distinct aspects of the problem. Laboratory studies on cells aim to elucidate the fundamental underlying mechanisms that link electromagnetic field exposure to biological effects. They try to identify mechanisms based on molecular or cellular changes that are brought about by the electromagnetic field - such a change would provide clues to how a physical force is converted into a biological action within the body. In these studies, single cells or tissues are removed from their normal living environment which may inactivate possible compensation mechanisms.Another type of study, involving animals, is more closely related to real life situations. These studies provide evidence that is more directly relevant to establishing safe exposure levels in humans and often employ several different field levels to investigate dose-response relationships.Epidemiological studies or human health studies are another direct source of information on long-term effects of exposure. These studies investigate the cause and distribution of diseases in real life situations, in communities and occupational groups. Researchers try to establish if there is a statistical association between exposure to electromagnetic fields and the incidence of a specific disease or adverse health effect. However, epidemiological studies are costly. More importantly, they involve measurements on very complex human populations and are difficult to control sufficiently well to detect small effects. For these reasons, scientists evaluate all relevant evidence when deciding about potential health hazards, including epidemiology, animal, and cellular studies.Interpretation of epidemiological studiesEpidemiological studies alone typically cannot establish a clear cause and effect relationship, mainly because they detect only statistical associations between exposure and disease, which may or may not be caused by the exposure. Imagine a hypothetical study showing a link between electromagnetic field exposure in electrical workers of the company ""X-Electricity"" and an increased risk of cancer. Even if a statistical association is observed, it could also be due to incomplete data on other factors in the workplace. For example, electrical workers may have been exposed to chemical solvents with the potential to cause cancer. Moreover, an observed statistical association may be due only to statistical effects, or the study itself may have suffered from some problem with its design.Therefore, finding an association between some agent and a specific disease does not necessarily mean that the agent caused the disease. Establishing causality requires that an investigator consider many factors. The case for a cause-and-effect link is strengthened if there is a consistent and strong association between exposure and effect, a clear dose-response relationship, a credible biological explanation, support provided by relevant animal studies, and above all consistency between studies. These factors have generally been absent in studies involving electromagnetic fields and cancer. This is one of the strongest reasons why scientists have generally been reluctant to conclude that weak electromagnetic fields have health effects.Difficulties in ruling out the possibility of very small risks""The absence of evidence of detrimental effects does not seem to suffice in modern society. The evidence of their absence is demanded more and more instead"". (Barnabas Kunsch, Austrian Research Centre Seibersdorf)""There is no convincing evidence for an adverse health effect of electromagnetic fields"" or ""A cause-effect link between electromagnetic fields and cancer has not been confirmed"" are typical of the conclusions that have been reached by expert committees that have examined the issue. This sounds as if science wanted to avoid giving an answer. Then why should research continue if scientists have already shown that there is no effect?The answer is simple: Human health studies are very good at identifying large effects, such as a connection between smoking and cancer. Unfortunately, they are less able to distinguish a small effect from no effect at all. If electromagnetic fields at typical environmental levels were strong carcinogens, then it would have been easy to have shown that by now. By contrast, if low level electromagnetic fields are a weak carcinogen, or even a strong carcinogen to a small group of people in the larger population, that would be far more difficult to demonstrate. In fact, even if a large study shows no association we can never be entirely sure that there is no relationship. The absence of an effect could mean that there really is none. But just as well it could mean that the effect is simply undetectable with our method of measurement. Therefore, negative results are generally less convincing than strong positive ones.The most difficult situation of all, which unfortunately has developed with epidemiology studies involving electromagnetic fields, is a collection of studies with weak positive results, which however are inconsistent among each other. In that situation, scientists themselves are likely to be divided about the significance of the data. However, for the reasons explained above, most scientists and clinicians agree that any health effects of low level electromagnetic fields, if they exist at all, are likely to be very small compared to other health risks that people face in everyday life.What's in the future?The main aim of WHO's International EMF Project is to initiate and co-ordinate research worldwide to produce a well-founded response to public concerns. This evaluation will integrate results from cellular, animal and human health studies to allow as comprehensive a health risk assessment as possible. A holistic assessment of a variety of relevant and reliable studies will provide the most reliable answer possible about the adverse health effects, if any exist, of long term exposure to weak electromagnetic fields.One way to illustrate the necessity of evidence from different types of experiments is a crossword. To be able to read the given crossword's solution with absolute CERTAINTY nine questions must be answered. Assuming we can only answer three of these, we might be able to guess the solution. However, the three given letters may also be part of a very different word. Every additional answer will increase our own confidence. In fact, science will probably never be able to answer all questions, but the more solid evidence we collect the better will be our guess at the solution.Key pointsLaboratory studies on cells aim to determine if there is a mechanism by which electromagnetic field exposure could cause harmful biological effects. Animal studies are essential for establishing effects in higher organisms whose physiology resembles that of humans to a degree. Epidemiological studies look for statistical associations between field exposure and the incidence of specific adverse health outcomes in humans.Finding a statistical association between some agent and a specific disease does not mean that the agent caused the disease.The absence of health effects could mean that there really are none; however, it could also signify that an existing effect is undetectable with present methods.Results of diverse studies (cellular, animal, and epidemiology) must be considered together before drawing conclusions about possible health risks of a suspected environmental hazard. Consistent evidence from these very different types of studies increases the degree of certainty about a true effect"
What are typical exposure levels at home and in the environment?,"Electromagnetic fields at homeBackground electromagnetic field levels from electricity transmission and distribution facilitiesElectricity is transmitted over long distances via high voltage power lines. Transformers reduce these high voltages for local distribution to homes and businesses. Electricity transmission and distribution facilities and residential wiring and appliances
    account for the background level of power frequency electric and magnetic fields in the home. In homes not located near power lines this background field may be up to about 0.2 µT. Directly beneath power lines the fields are much stronger. Magnetic
    flux densities at ground level can range up to several µT. Electric field levels underneath power lines can be as high as 10 kV/m. However, the fields (both electric and magnetic) drop off with distance from the lines. At 50 m to 100 m distance
    the fields are normally at levels that are found in areas away from high voltage power lines. In addition, house walls substantially reduce the electric field levels from those found at similar locations outside the house.Electric appliances in the householdThe strongest power frequency electric fields that are ordinarily encountered in the environment exist beneath high voltage transmission lines. In contrast, the strongest magnetic fields at power frequency are normally found very close to motors and other
    electrical appliances, as well as in specialized equipment such as magnetic resonance scanners used for medical imaging.Typical electric field strengths measured near household appliances(at a distance of 30 cm)(From: Federal Office for Radiation Safety, Germany 1999)Electric applianceElectric field strength (V/m)Stereo receiver180Iron120Refrigerator120Mixer100Toaster80Hair dryer80Colour TV60Coffee machine60Vacuum cleaner50Electric oven8Light bulb5  Guideline limit value5000Many people are surprised when they become aware of the variety of magnetic field levels found near various appliances. The field strength does not depend on how large, complex, powerful or noisy the device is. Furthermore, even between apparently
        similar devices, the strength of the magnetic field may vary a lot. For example, while some hair dryers are surrounded by a very strong field, others hardly produce any magnetic field at all. These differences in magnetic field strength are related
        to product design. The following table shows typical values for a number of electrical devices commonly found in homes and workplaces. The measurements were taken in Germany and all of the appliances operate on electricity at a frequency of 50
        Hz. It should be noted that the actual exposure levels vary considerably depending on the model of appliance and distance from it.Typical magnetic field strength of household appliances at various distancesElectric appliance3 cm distance (µT)

    The table illustrates two main points: First, the magnetic field strength around all appliances rapidly decreases the further you get away from them. Secondly, most household appliances are not operated very close to the body. At a distance of 30
        cm the magnetic fields surrounding most household appliances are more than 100 times lower than the given guideline limit of 100 µT at 50 Hz (83 µT at 60 Hz) for the general public.Television sets and computer screensComputer screens and television sets work on similar principles. Both produce static electric fields and alternating electric and magnetic fields at various frequencies. However, screens with liquid crystal displays used in some laptop computers and
        desktop units do not give rise to significant electric and magnetic fields. Modern computers have conductive screens which reduce the static field from the screen to a level similar to that of the normal background in the home or workplace. At
        the position of operators (30 to 50 cm from the screen), alternating magnetic fields are typically below 0.7 µT in flux density (at power frequencies). Alternating electric field strengths at operator positions range from below 1 V/m up
        to 10 V/m.Microwave ovensDomestic microwave ovens operate at very high power levels. However, effective shielding reduces leakage outside the ovens to almost non-detectable levels. Furthermore microwave leakage falls very rapidly with increasing distance from the oven. Many
        countries have manufacturing standards that specify maximum leakage levels for new ovens; an oven that meets the manufacturing standards will not present any hazard to the consumer.Portable telephonesPortable telephones operate at much lower intensities than mobile phones. This is because they are employed very close to their home base station, and so do not need strong fields to transmit over long distances. As a consequence, the radiofrequency
        fields that surround these devices are negligible.Electromagnetic fields in the environmentRadarRadars are used for navigation, weather forecasting, and military applications, as well as a variety of other functions. They emit pulsed microwave signals. The peak power in the pulse can be high even though the average power may
        be low. Many radars rotate or move up and down; this reduces the mean power density to which the public is exposed in the vicinity of radars. Even high power, non-rotating military radars limit exposures to below guideline levels at locations
        of public access.Security systemsAnti-theft systems in shops use tags that are detected by electrical coils at the exits. When a purchase is made the tags are removed or permanently deactivated. The electromagnetic fields from the coils do not generally exceed exposure guideline
        levels. Access control systems work in the same way with the tag incorporated into a key ring or identity card. Library security systems use tags that can be deactivated when a book is borrowed and reactivated when it is returned. Metal detectors
        and airport security systems set up a strong magnetic field of up to 100 µT that is disturbed by the presence of a metal object. Close to the frame of the detector, magnetic field strengths may approach and occasionally exceed guideline
        levels. However, this does not constitute a health hazard, as will be discussed in the section on guidelines. (see Are exposures above the guidelines harmful?)Electric trains and tramsLong-distance trains have one or more engine cars that are separate from the passenger cars. Thus passenger exposure comes mainly from the electricity supply to the train. Magnetic fields in the passenger cars of long-distance trains can be several
        hundred µT near the floor, with lower values (tens of µT) elsewhere in the compartment. Electric field strengths may reach 300 V/m. People living in the vicinity of railway lines may encounter magnetic fields from the overhead supply
        which, depending on the country, may be comparable to the fields produced by high-voltage power lines.Motors and traction equipment of trains and trams are normally located underneath the floors of passenger cars. At floor level, magnetic field intensities may amount to tens of µT in regions of the floor just above the motor. The fields fall
        off quickly with distance from the floor, and exposure of the upper bodies of passengers is much lower.TV and radioWhen choosing a radio station on your stereo at home, have you ever wondered what the familiar abbreviations AM and FM stand for? Radio signals are described as amplitude-modulated (AM) or frequency-modulated (FM) depending on the way in which they
        carry information. AM radio signals can be used for broadcasting over very long distances whereas FM waves cover more localized areas but can give a better sound quality.AM radio signals are transmitted via large arrays of antennas, which can be tens of metres high, on sites which are off-limits to the public. Exposures very close to antennas and feed cables can be high, but these would affect maintenance workers
        rather than the general public.TV and FM radio antennas are much smaller than AM radio antennas and are mounted in arrays at the top of high towers. The towers themselves serve only as supporting structures. As exposures near the foot of these towers are below guideline limits,
        public access to these areas may be possible. Small local TV and radio antennas are sometimes mounted on the top of buildings; if this is the case it may be necessary to control access to the roof.Mobile phones and their base stationsMobile phones allow people to be within reach at all times. These low-power radiowave devices transmit and receive signals from a network of fixed low power base stations. Each base station provides coverage to a given area. Depending on the number
        of calls being handled, base stations may be from only a few hundred metres apart in major cities to several kilometres apart in rural areas.Mobile phone base stations are usually mounted on the tops of buildings or on towers at heights of between 15 and 50 metres. The levels of transmissions from any particular base station are variable and depend on the number of calls and the callers'
        distance from the base station. Antennas emit a very narrow beam of radiowaves which spreads out almost parallel to the ground. Therefore, radiofrequency fields at ground level and in regions normally accessible to the public are many times below
        hazard levels. Guidelines would only be exceeded if a person were to approach to within a metre or two directly in front of the antennas. Until mobile phones became widely used, members of the public were mainly exposed to radiofrequency emissions
        from radio and TV stations. Even today, the phone towers themselves add little to our total exposure, as signal strengths in places of public access are normally similar to or lower than those from distant radio and TV stations.However, the user of a mobile phone is exposed to radiofrequency fields much higher than those found in the general environment. Mobile phones are operated very close to the head. Therefore, rather than looking at the heating effect across the whole
        body, the distribution of absorbed energy in the head of the user must be determined. From sophisticated computer modeling and measurements using models of heads, it appears that the energy absorbed from a mobile phone is not in excess of current
        guidelines.
    Concerns about other so-called non-thermal effects arising from exposure to mobile phone frequencies have also been raised. These include suggestions of subtle effects on cells that could have an effect on cancer development. Effects on electrically
        excitable tissues that may influence the function of the brain and nervous tissue have also been hypothesized. However, the overall evidence available to date does not suggest that the use of mobile phones has any detrimental effect on human health.Magnetic fields in everyday life: are they really that high?In recent years, national authorities in different countries have conducted many measurements to investigate electromagnetic field levels in the living environment. None of these surveys has concluded that field levels could bring about adverse health
        effects.
    The Federal Office for Radiation Safety in Germany recently measured the daily exposure to magnetic fields of about 2000 individuals across a range of occupations and public exposures. All of them were equipped with personal dosimeters for 24 hours.
        The measured exposure varied widely but gave an average daily exposure of 0.10 µT. This value is a thousand times lower that the standard limit of 100 µT for the public and five thousand times lower than the 500 µT exposure limit
        for workers. Furthermore, the exposure of people living in the centres of cities showed that there are no drastic differences in exposure between life in rural areas and life in the city. Even the exposure of people living in the vicinity of high
        voltage power lines differs very little from the average exposure in the population.Key pointsBackground electromagnetic field levels in the home are mainly caused by the transmission and distribution facilities for electricity or by electrical appliances.Electrical appliances differ greatly in the strength of fields they generate. Both electric and magnetic field levels decrease rapidly with distance from the appliances. In any event, fields surrounding household appliances usually are far below
            guideline limits.At operator positions the electric and magnetic fields of television sets and computer screens are hundreds of thousands times below guideline levels.Microwave ovens meeting the standards are not hazardous to health.As long as close public access to radar facilities, broadcasting antennas and mobile phone base stations is restricted, exposure guideline limits for radiofrequency fields will not be exceeded.The user of a mobile phone encounters field levels that are much higher than any levels in the normal living environment. However, even these increased levels do not appear to generate harmful effects.Many surveys have demonstrated that exposure to electromagnetic field levels in the living environment is extremely low."
What are the current standards?,"Standards are set to protect our health and are well known for many food additives, for concentrations of chemicals in water or air pollutants. Similarly, field standards exist to limit overexposure to electromagnetic field levels present in our environment.Who decides on guidelines?Countries set their own national standards for exposure to electromagnetic fields. However, the majority of these national standards draw on the guidelines set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). This non-governmental organization, formally recognized by WHO, evaluates scientific results from all over the world. Based on an in-depth review of the literature, ICNIRP produces guidelines recommending limits on exposure. These guidelines are reviewed periodically and updated if necessary.Electromagnetic field levels vary with frequency in a complex way. Listing every value in every standard and at every frequency would be difficult to understand. The table below is a summary of the exposure guidelines for the three areas that have become the focus of public concern: electricity in the home, mobile phone base stations and microwave ovens. These guidelines were last updated in April 1998.Summary of the ICNIRP exposure guidelines European power frequencyMobile phone base station frequencyMicrowave oven frequencyFrequency50 Hz50 Hz900 MHz1.8 GHz2.45 GHz Electric field (V/m)Magnetic field (µT)Power density (W/m2)Power density (W/m2)Power density (W/m2)Public exposure limits5 0001004.5910Occupational exposure limits10 00050022.545 ICNIRP, EMF guidelines, Health Physics 74, 494-522 (1998)The exposure guidelines may differ by a factor of more than 100 between some former Soviet countries and Western countries. With the globalization of trade and the rapid introduction of telecommunications worldwide there is a need for universal standards. As many countries from the former Soviet Union are now considering new standards, the WHO has recently launched an initiative to harmonize exposure guidelines worldwide. Future standards will be based on the results of the WHO's International Electromagnetic Field Project.What are guidelines based on?An important point to make is that a guideline limit is not a precise delineation between safety and hazard. There is no one level above which exposures become hazardous to health; instead, the potential risk to human health gradually increases with higher exposure levels. Guidelines indicate that, below a given threshold, electromagnetic field exposure is safe according to scientific knowledge. However, it does not automatically follow that, above the given limit, exposure is harmful.Nevertheless, to be able to set limits on exposure, scientific studies need to identify the threshold level at which first health effects become apparent. As humans cannot be used for experiments, guidelines critically rely on animal studies. Subtle behavioural changes in animals at low levels often precede more drastic changes in health at higher levels. Abnormal behaviour is a very sensitive indicator of a biological response and has been selected as the lowest observable adverse health effect. Guidelines recommend the prevention of electromagnetic field exposure levels, at which behavioural changes become noticeable.This threshold level for behaviour is not equal to the guideline limit. ICNIRP applies a safety factor of 10 to derive occupational exposure limits, and a factor of 50 to obtain the guideline value for the general public. Therefore, for example, in the radiofrequency and microwave frequency ranges, the maximum levels you might experience in the environment or in your home are at least 50 times lower than the threshold level at which first behavioural changes in animals become apparent.Why is the safety factor for occupational exposure guidelines lower than for the general public?The occupationally exposed population consists of adults who generally experience known electromagnetic field conditions. These workers are trained to be aware of potential risk and to take appropriate precautions. By contrast, the general public consists of individuals of all ages and of varying health status. In many cases, these are unaware of their exposure to EMF. Moreover, individual members of the public cannot be expected to take precautions to minimize or avoid exposure. These are the underlying considerations for more stringent exposure restrictions for the general public than for the occupationally exposed population.As we have seen earlier, low frequency electromagnetic fields induce currents in the human body (see What happens when you are exposed to electromagnetic fields?). But various biochemical reactions within the body itself generate currents as well. The cells or tissues will not be able to detect any induced currents below this background level. Therefore, at low frequencies, exposure guidelines ensure that the level of currents induced by an electromagnetic fields is below that of natural body currents.The main effect of radiofrequency energy is the heating of tissue. Consequently, exposure guidelines for radiofrequency fields and microwaves are set to prevent health effects caused by localized or whole-body heating (see What happens when you are exposed to electromagnetic fields?). Compliance with the guidelines will ensure that heating effects are sufficiently small not to be harmful.What guidelines cannot account forAt present, speculations about potential long-term health effects cannot form the basis for the issuing of guidelines or standards. Adding up the results of all scientific studies, the overall weight of evidence does not indicate that electromagnetic fields cause long-term health effects such as cancer. National and international bodies set and update standards on the basis of the latest scientific knowledge to protect against known health effects.Guidelines are set for the average population and cannot directly address the requirements of a minority of potentially more sensitive people. Air pollution guidelines, for example, are not based on the special needs of asthmatics. Similarly, electromagnetic field guidelines are not designed to protect people from interference with implanted medical electronic devices such as heart pacemakers. Instead, advice about exposure situations to be avoided should be sought from the manufacturers and from the clinician implanting the device.What are typical maximum exposure levels at home and in the environment?Some practical information will help you to relate to the international guideline values given above. In the following table you will find the most common sources of electromagnetic fields. All values are maximum levels of public exposure – your own exposure is likely to be much lower. For a closer look at field levels around individual electrical appliances, please see the section Typical exposure levels at home and in the environment.SourceTypical maximum public exposureElectric field (V/m)Magnetic flux density (µT)Natural fields20070 (Earth's magnetic field)Mains power(in homes not close to power lines)1000.2Mains power(beneath large power lines)10 00020Electric trains and trams30050TV and computer screens(at operator position)100.7 Typical maximum public exposure (W/m2)TV and radio transmitters0.1Mobile phone base stations0.1Radars0.2Microwave ovens0.5Source: WHO Regional Office for EuropeHow are guidelines put into practice and who checks on them?The responsibility to investigate fields around power lines, mobile phone base stations or any other sources accessible to the general public lies with government agencies and local authorities. They must ensure that compliance with guidelines is maintained.With electronic devices, the manufacturer is responsible for complying with the standard limits. However, as we have seen above, the nature of most devices ensures that the emitted fields are well below the cut-off values. Furthermore, many consumer associations carry out tests on a regular basis. In case of any particular concern or worry, contact the manufacturer directly or enquire with your local public health authority.Are exposures above the guidelines harmful?It is perfectly safe to eat a pot of strawberry jam up to the expiration date – but if you consume the jam any later the manufacturer cannot guarantee good food quality. Nevertheless, even a few weeks or months after the expiration date, it will usually be safe to eat the jam. Similarly, electromagnetic field guidelines ensure that, within the given exposure limit, no known adverse health effects will occur. A large safety factor is applied to the level known to cause a health consequence. Therefore, even if you experienced field strengths several times higher than the given limit value, your exposure would still be within this safety margin.In everyday situations, most people do not experience electromagnetic fields that exceed the guideline limits. Typical exposures are far below these values. However, there are occasions where a person's exposure may, for a short period, approach or even exceed the guidelines. According to ICNIRP, radiofrequency and microwave exposures should be averaged over time to address cumulative effects. The guidelines specify a time-averaging period of six minutes and short-term exposures above the limits are acceptable.In contrast, exposure to low frequency electric and magnetic fields is not time-averaged in the guidelines. To make things even more complicated, another factor called coupling comes into play. Coupling refers to the interaction between the electric and magnetic fields and the exposed body. This depends on the size and shape of the body, the type of tissue and the orientation of the body relative to the field. Guidelines must be conservative: ICNIRP always assumes maximum coupling of the field to the exposed individual. Thus the guideline limits provide maximum protection. For example, even though the magnetic field values for hairdryers and electric shavers appear to exceed the recommended values, extremely weak coupling between the field and the head prevents the induction of electrical currents that could exceed guideline limits.Key pointsICNIRP issues guidelines on the basis of the current scientific knowledge. Most countries draw on these international guidelines for their own national standards.Standards for low frequency electromagnetic fields ensure that induced electric currents are below the normal level of background currents within the body. Standards for radiofrequency and microwaves prevent health effects caused by localized or whole body heating.Guidelines do not protect against potential interference with electromedical devices.Maximum exposure levels in everyday life are typically far below guideline limits.Due to a large safety factor, exposure above the guideline limits is not necessarily harmful to health. Furthermore time-averaging for high frequency fields and the assumption of maximum coupling for low frequency fields introduce an additional safety margin."
What precautions are being followed?,"With more and more research data available, it has become increasingly unlikely that exposure to electromagnetic fields constitutes a serious health hazard, nevertheless, some uncertainty remains. The original scientific discussion about the interpretation of controversial results has shifted to become a societal as well as political issue.The public debate over electromagnetic fields focuses on the potential detriments of electromagnetic fields but often ignores the benefits associated with electromagnetic field technology. Without electricity, society would come to a standstill. Similarly, broadcasting and telecommunications have become a simple fact of modern life. An analysis of the balance between cost and potential hazards is essential.Protection of public healthInternational guidelines and national safety standards for electromagnetic fields are developed on the basis of the current scientific knowledge to ensure that the fields humans encounter are not harmful to health. To compensate uncertainties in knowledge (due, for example, to experimental errors, extrapolation from animals to humans, or statistical uncertainty), large safety factors are incorporated into the exposure limits. The guidelines are regularly reviewed and updated if necessary. It has been suggested that taking additional precautions to cope with remaining uncertainties may be a useful policy to adopt while science improves knowledge on health consequences. However, the type and extent of the cautionary policy chosen critically depends on the strength of evidence for a health risk and the scale and nature of the potential consequences. The cautionary response should be proportional to the potential risk. For more information, see the WHO Backgrounder on Cautionary Policies.Several policies promoting caution have been developed to address concerns about public, occupational and environmental health and safety issues connected with chemical and physical agents.What should be done while research continues?One of the objectives of the International EMF Project is to help national authorities weigh the benefits of using electromagnetic field technologies against the possibility that a health risk might be discovered. Furthermore, the WHO will issue recommendations on protective measures, if they may be needed. It will take some years for the required research to be completed, evaluated and published. In the meantime, the World Health Organization has issued a series of recommendations:Strict adherence to existing national or international safety standards: such standards, based on current knowledge, are developed to protect everyone in the population with a large safety factor.Simple protective measures: barriers around strong electromagnetic field sources help preclude unauthorized access to areas where exposure limits may be exceeded.Consultation with local authorities and the public in siting new power lines or mobile phone base stations: siting decisions are often required to take into account aesthetics and public sensitivities. Open communication during the planning stages can help create public understanding and greater acceptance of a new facility.Communication: an effective system of health information and communication among scientists, governments, industry and the public can help raise general awareness of programmes dealing with exposure to electromagnetic fields and reduce any mistrust and fears.For further information, see the WHO Fact Sheets on Electromagnetic Fields and Public Health."

What effect does UV have on the skin?,"The best known acute effect of excessive UV exposure is erythema, the familiar skin reddening termed sunburn. In addition, most people will tan from the UV stimulation of melanin production, which occurs within a few days following exposure. A further, less obvious adaptive effect is the thickening of the outermost layers of the skin that attenuates UV penetration to the deeper layers of the skin. Both changes are a sign of damage to the skin.Susceptibility to skin damage depends on skin type; individuals with fairer skin will be more prone to sunburn or erythema, than people with darker skin Similarly, the ability to adapt to UV exposure (able to tan) also depends on skin type.Chronic exposure to UV radiation also causes a number of degenerative changes in the cells, fibrous tissue and blood vessels of the skin. These include freckles, nevi and lentigines, which are pigmented areas of the skin, and diffuse brown pigmentation. UV radiation accelerates skin aging, and the gradual loss of the skin’s elasticity results in wrinkles and dry, coarse skin."
What are the effects of UV on the eye?,"The eye is recessed within its orbit and shielded by the brow ridge, the eyebrows and the eyelashes. Bright light activates the constriction of the pupil and the squinting reflex to minimize the penetration of the sun’s rays into the eye. However, the effectiveness of these natural defences in protecting against the dangers of UV radiation is limited under extreme conditions such as sunbed use or strong ground reflection from sand, water and snow. Acute effects of UV radiation exposure include photokeratitis and photoconjunctivitis. These inflammatory reactions are comparable to a sunburn of the very sensitive skin-like tissues of the eyeball and eyelids, and usually appear within a few hours of exposure. Both can be very painful, but are reversible and do not result in any long-term damage to the eye or vision. Extreme forms of photokeratitis are 'arc-eye' and 'snow blindness'.Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness in the world. Proteins in the eye’s lens unravel, tangle and accumulate pigments that cloud the lens and eventually lead to blindness. Even though cataracts appear to different degrees in most individuals as they age, sun exposure, in particular exposure to UVB, appears to be a major risk factor for cataract development."
How does UV effect the immune system?,"The immune system is the body’s defence mechanism against infections and cancers, and is normally very effective at recognizing and responding to an invading micro-organism or the onset of a tumour. Although the data remain preliminary, there is increasing evidence for a systematic immunosuppressive effect of both acute and low-dose UV radiation exposure.Animal experiments have demonstrated that UV radiation can modify the course and severity of skin tumours. Also, people treated with immunosuppressive drugs have a greater incidence of squamous cell carcinoma than the normal population. Consequently, beyond its role in the initiation of skin cancer, sun exposure may reduce the body’s defences that normally limit the progressive development of skin tumours.Several studies have demonstrated that exposure to environmental levels of UV radiation alters the activity and distribution of some of the cells responsible for triggering immune responses in humans. Consequently, sun exposure may enhance the risk of infection with viral, bacterial, parasitic or fungal infections, which has been demonstrated in a variety of animal models. Furthermore, especially in countries of the developing world, high UV radiation levels may reduce the effectiveness of vaccines. Since many vaccine-preventable diseases are extremely infectious, any factor that results in even a small decrease in vaccine efficacy can have a major impact on public health."
What is 5G?,"5G, or fifth Generation, is the latest wireless mobile phone technology, first widely deployed in 2019. 5G is expected to increase performance and a wide range of new applications, including strengthening e-Health (telemedicine, remote surveillance, telesurgery)."
What are the main differences between 5G and previous technologies?,"5G represents an evolution in telecommunication standards. To enable increased performance, 5G will extend into higher frequencies around 3.5 GHz and up to a few tens of GHz.  The higher frequencies are new to mobile phone networks, but are commonly used in other applications, such as point-to-point radio links and body-scanners for security checks. At these higher frequencies, 5G networks will use a greater number of base stations and of connected objects. 5G will further employ beam-forming antennas to focus signals more efficiently towards the device in use, rather than having the signal spread in broad directions as in current base station antennas."
Exposure levels,"Currently, exposure from 5G infrastructures at around 3.5 GHz is similar to that from existing mobile phone base stations. With the use of multiple beams from 5G antennas, exposure could be more variable as a function of location of the users and their usage. Given that the 5G technology is currently at an early stage of deployment, the extent of any change in exposure to radiofrequency fields is still under investigation."
What are the potential health risks from 5G?,"To date, and after much research performed, no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies. Health-related conclusions are drawn from studies performed across the entire radio spectrum but, so far, only a few studies have been carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5G.Tissue heating is the main mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency fields and the human body. Radiofrequency exposure levels from current technologies result in negligible temperature rise in the human body. As the frequency increases, there is less penetration into the body tissues and absorption of the energy becomes more confined to the surface of the body (skin and eye). Provided that the overall exposure remains below international guidelines, no consequences for public health are anticipated."
What are the international exposure guidelines?,"Two international bodies produce exposure guidelines on electromagnetic fields. Many countries currently adhere to the guidelines recommended by:The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and,The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, through the International Committee on Electromagnetic SafetyThese guidelines are not technology-specific. They cover radiofrequencies up to 300 GHz, including the frequencies under discussion for 5G."
What is WHO doing?,"WHO is conducting a health risk assessment from exposure to radiofrequencies, covering the entire radiofrequency range, including 5G, to be published by 2022.WHO will review scientific evidence related to potential health risks from 5G exposure as the new technology is deployed, and as more public health-related data become available.WHO established the International Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) Project in 1996. The project investigates the health impact of exposure to electric and magnetic fields in the frequency range 0-300 GHz and advises national authorities on EMF radiation protection.WHO advocates for further research into the possible long-term health impacts of all aspects of mobile-telecommunications. The Organization identifies and promotes related research priorities. It also develops public information materials and promotes dialogue among scientists, governments, and the public to increase understanding around health and mobile communications. Relevant linksWHO Radiation health topicWHO EMF websiteNational regulations on exposure to EMFWHO Fact sheetsOn mobile phones On base stations"
What is the current risk of radiation-related health problems in Japan for those residing near the reactor in comparison to those in other parts of Japan?,"During the early phase of the nuclear emergency, radiation-related health was dependent on exposure, which is turn was due to several things, including the amount and type of radiation released from the reactor; weather conditions, such as wind and rain; a person’s proximity to the plant; and the amount of time spent in irradiated areas.
The Government of Japan’s early actions in response to events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were in line with the existing recommendations for radiation exposure. The Government has evacuated individuals who were living within a 20-kilometre radius around the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Those living between 20 km and 30 km from the plant were asked to evacuate voluntarily. In general, people living farther away of the site of the event are at lower risk than those who live nearby.
In light of evolving new information on levels of environmental radioactivity in the 20-30 km zone and some surrounding areas beyond the 30km zone, the Government of Japan established new planned evacuation zones from which residents were relocated to temporary housing based on the estimated cumulative doses they may receive in the 1 year following the accident.
In addition, an emergency evacuation preparedness zone was also identified in which residents were asked to prepare their affairs in case they were asked to evacuate. These zones also follow administrative boundaries and extend beyond the 30 km radius."
Is there a risk of radioactive exposure from food contamination?,"Yes, there is a risk of exposure as a result of contamination in food.
However, contaminated food would have to be consumed over prolonged periods to represent a risk to human health.
The radioactive iodine and caesium in concentrations above the Japanese regulatory limits have been detected in some food commodities as a result of food monitoring
Japanese authorities have advised residents to avoid these foods and have implemented measures to prevent their sale and distribution."
Are there health risks to people living outside of Japan from radiation emitted into the atmosphere from damaged Japanese nuclear power plants?,"Thus far, there are no health risks to people living in other countries from radioactive material released into the atmosphere from the Japanese nuclear power plants. Radiation levels measured to date in other countries are far below the level of background radiation that most people are exposed to in every day circumstances.Radiation levels have been monitored by the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), which operates 63 surveillance stations around the world.Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO)"
Are people normally exposed to ionizing radiation?,"Human beings are exposed to natural radiation (also known as background radiation) on a daily basis. Natural radiation comes from space (i.e. cosmic rays) as well as from naturally-occurring radioactive materials found in the soil, water and air. Radon gas is a naturally-occurring gas that is the main source of natural radiation.People can also be exposed to radiation from man-made sources. Today, the most common man-made sources of ionizing radiation are X-ray machines and other medical devices.Radiation doses can be expressed in Sievert (Sv) units. On average, a person is exposed to approximately 3.0 milli Sieverts (mSv)/year, of which 80% (2.4 mSv) is due to naturally-occurring sources (i.e., background radiation), 19.6 % (almost 0.6 mSv) is due to the medical use of radiation and the remaining 0.4% (around 0.01 mSv) is due to other sources of human-made radiation.In some parts of the world, levels of exposure to natural radiation differ due to local geology. People in some areas can be exposed to more than 200 times the global average."
What is ionizing radiation?,"When certain atoms disintegrate, they release a type of energy called ionizing radiation. This energy can travel as either electromagnetic waves (i.e. gamma or X-rays) or as particles (i.e. alpha, beta or neutrons).The atoms that emit radiation are called radionuclides; e.g., radioactive iodine, caesium, and plutonium.Ionizing radiation is an essential tool for diagnosis and treatment in medicine, that must be used with rigorous attention to safety."
How are people exposed to ionizing radiation?,"Ionizing radiation may result from sources outside or inside of the body (i.e. external irradiation or internal contamination).External irradiation is produced when a person is exposed to external sources (i.e. X-rays) or when radioactive material (i.e. dust, liquid, or aerosols) becomes attached to skin or clothes.Internal contamination may result from breathing in or swallowing radioactive material or through contamination of wounds."
What type of radiation exposure could occur in a nuclear power plant accident?,"In the event a nuclear power plant does not function properly, individuals, land, and structures in the vicinity of the plant could be exposed to a mixture of radioactive products generated inside the reactor, also known as “nuclear fission products”. The main radionuclides representing health risk are radioactive caesium and radioactive iodine.Members of the public may be exposed directly to radionuclides, either in the air or if food and water become contaminated by these materials.Rescuers, first responders, and nuclear power plant workers may be exposed to radioactive materials and higher radiation doses inside or around the power plant due to their professional activities."
What is the WHO travel advice for Japan?,"WHO has not issued any advice on general restrictions regarding travel to Japan.
During the early phase of the emergency, travellers were advised to avoid travel to the areas most affected by the earthquake and tsunami because of disruptions to essential services, such as transport and electric power. The ongoing disaster relief activities, including the nuclear power plant emergency response and control activities, would have made travel difficult and could have consumed resources needed by relief workers and residents. Moreover, as indicated by the Japanese authorities, travel within the evacuation and exclusion zones surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was prohibited.
In general, travellers who do not have essential reasons to travel were advised to give careful consideration to deferring travel to any areas where there had been considerable disruption to the normal infrastructure and where authorities were responding to urgent humanitarian needs.
The situation in Japan has improved. Residents are being temporary allowed access into some areas that had been evacuated, but restrictions still exist. The Government of Japan is monitoring the situation and plans to lift restrictions once safety conditions are met.
Information on the status of the nuclear facilities in Fukushima can be found on Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) website and on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) website.
Travellers should be aware of the risk of further earthquakes across Japan. Moreover, there may be areas of power, fuel, food and water shortages.

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)"
Do travellers returning from Japan represent a health risk for others?,"At this time, only those involved in the emergency response near the nuclear power plant remain in the area where there are higher levels of radioactivity. For their own safety, all personnel in these areas should undergo decontamination procedures when they leave the site. Travellers returning from Japan who have come from the 20 km evacuation zone surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and who have undergone proper screening and decontamination procedures, and travellers from all other areas, do not pose a radioactive health risk to others and do not require screening."
What are the acute health effects of radiation exposure?,"If the dose of radiation exceeds a certain threshold level, it can produce acute effects, including skin redness, hair loss, radiation burns, and acute radiation syndrome (ARS).In a nuclear power plant accident, the general population is not likely to be exposed to doses high enough to cause such effects.Rescuers, first responders, and nuclear power plant workers are more likely to be exposed to doses of radiation high enough to cause acute effects."
What long-term effects can be expected from radiation exposure?,"Exposure to ionizing doses of radiation can increase the risk of cancer.Radioactive iodine can be released during nuclear emergencies. If radioactive iodine is breathed in or swallowed, it will concentrate in the thyroid gland and increase the risk of thyroid cancer. Among persons exposed to radioactive iodine, the risk of thyroid cancer can be lowered by taking potassium iodide pills, which helps prevent the uptake of the radioactive iodine.The risk of thyroid cancer following radiation exposure is higher in children and young adults."
Does radiation exposure pose a risk to foetuses?,"Foetuses are at risk of brain damage from radiation during weeks 8-25 of gestation.Studies have shown brain damage in foetuses following exposure to an acute dose of radiation exceeding 100 mSv during weeks 8-15 and an acute dose exceeding 200 mSv during weeks 16-25. Outside of weeks 8-25, studies have not shown radiation risk to the fetal brain.Foetal exposure to radiation can increase the risk of cancer in childhood. Studies have shown this effect with doses above 100 mSv.Dose comparisons for ionising radiationHealth Protection Agency (UK) web site"
What emotional impact can a nuclear accident have on children? How can they be assisted?,"Disasters and their aftermath can have a profound emotional impact on children and may result in long term behavioural disturbances. Children exhibiting signs of stress - including difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, developing new fears, changes in behaviour (e.g. clinging, bedwetting), being preoccupied with the crisis - should receive extra time and attention from family members and other caregivers.
Children are among the most vulnerable of those affected by a nuclear accident because of their inability to fully understand and process the immediate and long-term effects of the emergency. Family members and caregivers should try to find out what the child thinks and feels about the disaster. If the child is scared because she/he has misunderstood what has happened, then simple explanations should be provided while avoiding alarming details. Children need a chance to play and relax. Encourage older children to be helpful and maintain regular routines.
Reactions to stress can depend on developmental level and are generally marked by changes in typical behaviour for a specific child or adolescent. Reactions may continue for days, weeks or even months. Children should see a paediatrician or mental health professional if anxiety or grief interferes with their daily functioning, or if these emotions do not reduce with time. Early management of these symptoms can speed recovery and prevent long-term consequences.

Which public health actions are most important to take?,"Health effects can only occur if someone is exposed to radiation, thus the main protective action someone can take is to prevent exposure. Those closest to the radiation source are at greatest risk of exposure and the greater the distance away, the lower the risk.
In the early phase of a nuclear emergency (within the first hours/days), urgent protective actions may be implemented to prevent radiation exposure, taking into account projected doses that people may received in the short-term (e.g. within 2-7 days). These necessary actions depend on the estimated exposure (i.e., the amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere and the prevailing meteorological conditions, such as wind and rain. Actions may include: evacuation of the area around or near the nuclear power plant; advising people to shelter in their homes, offices, other secure buildings or designated shelters to reduce exposure; and distributing and administering potassium iodide pills to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer).
When environmental and human monitoring data increases, relocation of people to temporary housing may be considered in particular areas, taking into account the radiation doses that residents may receive over the long-term (e.g. one year).
If warranted, public health or national authorities may restrict or prohibit the consumption of vegetables and dairy products produced in the vicinity of the nuclear power plant in order to reduce exposure. Monitoring programs are established to inform longer term decisions on food restriction, water consumption, and the control of internationally traded foodstuffs.
Only competent authorities who have conducted a careful analysis of the emergency situation are in a position to recommend which of these public health measures should be undertaken."
How can I protect myself?,"Keep informed by obtaining accurate and authoritative information (e.g., information from authorities delivered by radio, TV or the Internet) and following your government's instructions.The decision to take potassium iodide should be based on information provided by national health authorities who will be in the best position to determine if this step is warranted."
"If I have been exposed to radioactive material released into the environment, what should I do?","If you are coming indoors after exposure to radioactive material, undress in the doorway to avoid further contamination in your home or shelter. Remove clothing and shoes and place them in a plastic bag. Seal the bag and place it in a safe location away from living areas, children, and pets.Shower or bathe with warm water and soap.Notify authorities that you may have contaminated clothing and personal belongings to be handled appropriately and disposed of according to accepted national procedures."
"When people are advised to stay indoors, what does this mean?","When a radiological or nuclear event occurs, public health authorities may order residents in the affected areas to stay indoors rather than evacuate. You may be advised to take shelter at home, at work, or in public shelters. Shelter can provide protection from external exposure and from inhalation of radioactive material.If you are advised to stay indoors, you should find the safest room in your house or office building: if possible, one which has no windows and no external doors. Ventilation systems, such as heating and cooling systems, should be shut down.In sub-zero temperatures, it is important to keep warm. If you have been instructed to shelter in your home, office, or other structure, it may not be safe to burn fuels—such as gas, coal, or wood—to keep warm. Doing so may result in carbon monoxide poisoning, which can occur when rooms are not adequately ventilated. If it is available, electrical forms of heating are safer."
What are potassium iodide pills?,"Potassium iodide pills are a source of stable (i.e. non-radioactive) iodine. The thyroid gland requires iodine to produce thyroid hormones. The presence of stable iodine in the body in an appropriate amount blocks the thyroid from absorbing radioactive iodine (radioiodine), reducing the risk of thyroid cancer which may follow from exposure to radioiodine.Potassium iodide pills are not “radiation antidotes”. They do not protect against external radiation, or against any other radioactive substances besides radioiodine. They may also cause medical complications for some individuals with poorly functioning kidneys. Potassium iodide should be taken only when there is a clear public health recommendation."
When and why should I take potassium iodide?,"You should only take potassium iodide when it is recommended by public health authorities. If you are at risk or have been exposed to radioiodine, potassium iodide pills may be given to protect the thyroid gland from uptake of radioiodine. This can reduce the risk of thyroid cancer in the long run, when given before or shortly after exposure."
Should I take iodized salt to protect myself from radiation?,"No, you should not take iodized salt to protect yourself from radiation. It is dangerous to take large amounts of iodized salt in order to increase the amount of stable iodine in the body.Increasing one's daily intake of iodized salt will cause more harm than good. The main ingredient of iodized salt is sodium chloride, which is linked with hypertension (high blood pressure) and other medical disorders. The iodine content in iodized salt is too low to prevent uptake of radioiodine.Sodium chloride is acutely toxic in large amounts: even tablespoon quantities of salt repeatedly taken over a short period of time could cause poisoning."
Can I take other forms of iodine?,"No, you should not take products that contain iodine, other than medicines recommended by public health authorities.Iodine is found in a variety of household and industrial products. For example, iodine may be found in some disinfectants, antiseptics, and water-sterilizing solutions. These products should not be taken as an alternative to potassium iodide pills, because such products contain other ingredients that can be harmful if swallowed."
Can pregnant women take potassium iodide pills?,"Yes, most pregnant women can take potassium iodide pills, following the instructions of public health authorities. Potassium iodide will cross the placenta and protect the thyroid of the growing foetus, as well as the mother."
What are the recommendations for breastfeeding women regarding potassium iodide?,"As with the rest of the population, breastfeeding women should take potassium iodide tablets only when advised by public health authorities. However, this will not be sufficient to fully protect the breastfed child who will need potassium iodide as well, in special doses adapted for newborns and infants.Under these conditions, breastfeeding can continue."
Can food produced in other countries be affected by the events in Japan?,"Radioactive material has been released into the environment from damaged Japanese nuclear power plants. Radiation levels measured to date in other countries are far below the level of background radiation that most people are exposed to in everyday circumstances and do not present health or transportation safety hazards, according to the United Nations organizations closely monitoring the situation.
Minute amounts of radioactive caesium and iodine might be found using very sensitive detection methods but this should not affect foods produced in other countries as the amounts involved will be well below acceptable levels and would not pose a health concern to those who eat the food."
What are the potential health effects of consuming contaminated food?,"Consuming food contaminated with radioactive material will increase the amount of radioactivity a person is exposed to and could increase the health risks associated with exposure to radiation. The exact effect will depend on which radionuclides have been ingested and the amount. According to data reported so far, radioactive iodine and caesium are the main contaminants, and concentrations in some food samples have been detected at levels above the Japanese regulatory limits.
Radioactive iodine has a half-life of eight days and decays naturally within weeks. If ingested, it can accumulate in the body, particularly the thyroid gland, and increase the risk of thyroid cancer, particularly in children.
The ingestion of potassium iodide is an established method to prevent the accumulation of radioactive iodine in the thyroid.
Radioactive caesium has a half-life longer than that of radioactive iodine (up to 30 years) and can stay in the environment for many years. Like all radionuclides, exposure to radiation from radioactive caesium can result in an increased risk of cancer."
Is all food production in Japan affected by the nuclear emergency?,"No, not all foods will be affected. Food that was dispatched or commercially packaged before the emergency situation would not be affected. However, some food produced in areas where radioactive material has been deposited has been found to be contaminated. This is why the Japanese authorities have instituted monitoring and are taking measures to address the issue."
What impact will this have on food and food production in Japan?,"The impact on food and food production in Japan will depend upon the types of radionuclides and the amount of radioactivity deposited or present where food is being produced or harvested. Although radioactive iodine in food is of immediate concern after nuclear emergencies, it has a relatively short half-life and will naturally decay over a short time frame. Radioactive caesium has also been detected in food. In contrast to radioactive iodine, radioactive caesium can linger in the environment for many years and could continue to present a longer term problem for food, and food production, and a threat to human health."
How do food products become radioactive?,"Foods can become contaminated with radioactive materials when they are released as the result of a nuclear or radiological emergency. In these circumstances, radioactive material falling from the air or carried in rain water or snow, can deposit on the surface of foods like fruits and vegetables or animal feed. Also, over time, radioactivity can build up within food, as radionuclides are transferred through soil into crops or animals. Radioactivity can also be washed into rivers, lakes and the sea where fish and seafood could take up the radionuclides. The severity of the risk depends on the radionuclide mix and the level of contaminant released.Radioactivity cannot contaminate food that is packaged; for example, tinned or plastic-wrapped food is protected from radioactivity as long as the food is sealed."
Why is food affected in areas beyond the evacuation zone?,"During a nuclear emergency, an evacuation zone is established to prevent people from being exposed to immediate and unacceptable levels of radiation posing a threat to human health. However, contamination of food can occur through uptake from soil to crops, or to animals through feed, even when levels of radioactive contamination are lower than those which might pose a direct threat to human health. The standards for acceptable limits for radioactivity in food are set at low levels in order to take into account the possibility of contaminated food being eaten over an extended period of time and resulting in a cumulative dose."
Are there rules for radioactivity in foods for international trade?,"There are internationally agreed Codex Guideline Levels (GLs) for radionuclide levels in internationally traded food following a nuclear or radiological emergency. These GLs are published by the Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission.The GLs state that, “as far as generic radiological protection of food consumers is concerned, when radionuclide levels in food do not exceed the corresponding Guideline Level, the food should be considered as safe for human consumption. When the Guideline Levels are exceeded, national governments shall decide whether and under what circumstances the food should be distributed within their territory or jurisdiction. National governments may wish to adopt different values for internal use within their own territories, where the assumptions concerning food distribution that have been made to derive the Guideline Levels may not apply, e.g., in the case of widespread radioactive contamination. For foods that are consumed in small quantities, such as spices, that represent a small percentage of total diet and hence a small addition to the total dose, the Guideline Levels may be increased by a factor of 10”.GLs for radionuclide levels can be found in the Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food and Feed – (CODEX STAN 193-1995)Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food and Feed(CODEX STAN 193-1995)"
What actions are being taken to monitor the safety of food from Japan?,"In response to the nuclear accident in Japan, Japanese authorities have instituted monitoring of food products and have restricted the consumption and distribution of some products in certain prefectures, or areas found to contain radionuclides exceeding Japan's provisional regulation value. Findings from food monitoring in Japan and decisions related to the consumption and distribution of food products are published regularly on the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare web site.Many countries have implemented food control measures to mirror actions taken within Japan. Some countries have indicated they now require documentation verifying the safety of products and/or the prefecture of origin of the food. Other countries have suspended food imports from Japan. In addition, many countries have increased monitoring on foods imported from Japan.Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare"
What general advice can be given to food consumers and producers in the event of a nuclear emergency?,"The response to an emergency involving radioactivity should be the same as the response to any emergency involving any hazardous material contaminating food. In the early stages of an emergency, and if it is safe to do so, it is possible to take immediate actions to prevent or minimize the contamination of food by radiological materials. For example, it is possible to do the following:protect food and animal fodder which is stored in the open; cover with plastic sheets or impermeable tarpaulins;close the ventilation of greenhouses to protect growing vegetables;bring livestock in from pastures and move animals into a shed or barn;harvest any ripe crops and place under cover before any fallout has been recorded; anddon’t harvest after fallout – wait for further instructions after contamination has been recorded.Many other short-, medium- and long-term actions need to be considered in areas confirmed to be seriously contaminated, such as:avoid consumption of locally produced milk or vegetables;avoid slaughtering animals;avoid consumption and harvesting of aquatic animals and plants (including fish, shellfish, and algae); andavoid hunting or gathering mushrooms or other wild or collected foods.Additional information on emergency preparedness and responseJoint FAO/IAEA Programme"
Can I drink the tap water in Japan?,"Drinking tap water in Japan poses no immediate health riskThe Japanese authorities closely monitored the situation and issued advice, when needed, against consumption of tap water, including specific recommendations for infants. Essential hydration of infants should not be compromised in an attempt to reduce exposure to radionuclide contamination.The standards adopted by the Japanese authorities for this emergency are precautionary. In the case of radioactive iodine the standard for adults is 300 Becquerels per litre in drinking-water. In the very unlikely scenario that drinking-water was contaminated and consumed for an entire year at this level, the additional radiation exposure from this water would be equivalent to natural background radiation during one year.During the early phase of the emergency WHO urged people in the area to heed the advice of local authorities, as they have access to the latest measurements of radiation levels in water to compare against the standards for adults and children. Currently, restrictions of consumption of tap water have been lifted in all prefectures."
Can radioactive contamination be removed from water?,Standard water treatment procedures may remove significant amounts of radioactive contaminants. Other options to reduce concentrations of radiation contaminants include controlled dilution of contaminated water with non-contaminated water.Boiling water will not remove radioactive iodine.
Why do the guidance levels for radioactive Iodine-131 in drinking water vary?,"The guidance levels found in different sets of recommendations vary because some apply to routine situations and others to emergency situations. The table below summarizes the guidance on radioactive Iodine-131 in drinking water and provides an indication
    of the equivalent exposure from routine activities.
Guideline nameAdvised maximum levels for radioactive activity in water (Bq/L)Approximate equivalent radiation exposure if consuming water at this activity level for a yearWHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (1)10A New York - London flightJapanese provisional (emergency) standard for adults (2)300One year's exposure to natural background radiation, or 10-15 chest X-raysJapanese provisional (emergency) standard for infants (3)100IAEA Operational Intervention Level for nuclear emergencies (4)3000Not applicable.

These standards are precautionary and have taken international guidance

This level is equivalent to the international guideline set by Codex Alimentarius for infant food.(4) IAEA Safety Guide GSG-2 established Operational Intervention Levels (OILs) which would be the default international guidance levels for the early stage of an emergency."
What is WHO's role in nuclear emergencies?,"In accordance with its Constitution and the International Health Regulations, WHO is mandated to assess public health risks and provide technical consultation and assistance in association with public health events, including those associated with radiation events. In doing so, WHO is working with independent experts and other UN agencies.WHO's work is supported by a global network comprising more than 40 specialized institutions in radiation emergency medicine. The network, the Radiation Emergency Medical Preparedness and Assistance Network (REMPAN), provides technical assistance for radiation emergency preparedness and response."
What is XDR-TB?,"XDR-TB, an abbreviation for extensively drug-resistant (XDR) 
tuberculosis (TB), is a form of TB which is resistant to at least 4 of 
the core anti-TB drugs. XDR-TB involves resistance to the 2 most 
powerful anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin, also known as 
multidrug-resistance (MDR-TB), in addition to resistance to any of the 
fluoroquinolones (such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) and to at least 1
 of 3 injectable second-line drugs (amikacin, capreomycin or kanamycin).MDR-TB and XDR-TB both take substantially longer to treat than
 ordinary (drug-susceptible) TB, and require the use of second-line 
anti-TB drugs, which are more expensive and have more side-effects than 
the first-line drugs used for drug-susceptible TB."
How do people get XDR-TB?,"People may get XDR-TB in 1 of 2 ways. It may develop in a 
patient who is receiving treatment for active TB, when anti-TB drugs are
 misused or mismanaged, and is usually a sign of inadequate clinical 
care or drug management. It can happen when patients are not properly 
supported to complete their full course of treatment; when health-care 
providers prescribe the wrong treatment, or the wrong dose, or for too 
short a period of time; when the supply of drugs to the clinics 
dispensing drugs is erratic; or when the drugs are of poor quality.The second way that people can develop XDR-TB is by becoming 
infected from a patient who is already ill with the condition. Patients 
with TB of the lungs can spread the disease by coughing, sneezing, or 
simply talking. A person needs only to breathe in a small number of 
these germs to become infected. However only a small proportion of 
people infected with TB germs develop the disease. A person can be 
infected by XDR-TB bacteria but not develop the active disease, just as 
with drug-susceptible TB."
How easily is XDR-TB spread?,"Studies suggest that there is probably no difference between 
the risk of transmission of XDR-TB and any other forms of TB. The spread
 of TB bacteria depends on factors such as the number and concentration 
of infectious people in any one place together, and the presence of 
people with a higher risk of being infected (such as those with 
HIV/AIDS).The likelihood of becoming infected increases with the time 
that a previously uninfected person spends in the same room as an 
infectious case. The risk of spread increases where there is a high 
concentration of TB bacteria, such as can occur in poorly-ventilated 
environments like overcrowded houses, hospitals, or prisons. The risk of
 spread is reduced if infectious patients receive timely and proper 
treatment."
How can a person avoid becoming infected with XDR-TB?,"While patients with XDR-TB may be as infectious as those with 
ordinary TB, the chances of a TB infection being XDR-TB is lower due to 
the rarity of the condition. The measures to be taken are the same as 
those for the prevention of ordinary TB.Close contact with a patient with infectious TB is to be 
avoided, especially in poorly ventilated spaces. The risk of becoming 
infected with TB is very low outdoors in the open air. TB patients 
should be encouraged to follow good cough hygiene, for example, covering
 their mouths with a handkerchief when they cough, or even, in the early
 stages of treatment, using a surgical mask, especially when in closed 
environments with poor ventilation."
How can a person who already has ordinary TB avoid getting XDR-TB?,"The most important thing is for the health care workers and 
community to provide all the means (such as information, counselling, 
and material support) that enable patients to continue taking all their 
treatment as prescribed.No doses should be missed and above all, treatment should be 
taken right through to the end. If a patient finds that side-effects are
 a problem – for example, the tablets make them feel sick – then they 
should inform their doctor or nurse, because often there is a simple 
solution. If they need to go away for any reason, patients should make 
sure they have enough tablets with them for the duration of the trip."
Can XDR-TB be cured or treated?,"XDR-TB patients can be cured, but with the current drugs 
available, the likelihood of success is much smaller than in patients 
with ordinary TB or even MDR-TB. Cure depends on the extent of the drug 
resistance, the severity of the disease and whether the patient’s immune
 system is compromised.Patients infected with HIV may have a higher mortality rate. 
Early and accurate diagnosis is important so that effective treatment is
 provided as soon as possible. Effective treatment requires that a good 
selection of second-line drugs is available to clinicians who have 
special expertise in treating such cases."
How common is XDR-TB?,"XDR-TB is rare, however 117 countries worldwide had reported at 
least 1 case by the end of 2015. It is estimated that about 9.5% of 
MDR-TB cases worldwide have XDR-TB. In 2015, there were an estimated 480
 000 new cases of MDR-TB worldwide, and an additional 100 000 people 
with rifampicin-resistant TB were also newly eligible for MDR-TB 
treatment. Of the 580 000 people newly eligible for MDR-TB treatment, 
only 125 000 (20%) were enrolled."
How do countries prevent XDR-TB?,"National TB control programmes working with all health 
services can prevent XDR-TB by ensuring that all practitioners working 
with people with TB adhere to the International Standards for TB Care.These standards emphasize:providing proper diagnosis and treatment to all TB patients, including those with drug-resistant TB;assuring regular, timely supplies of all anti-TB drugs;proper management of anti-TB drugs and providing support to patients to maximize adherence to prescribed regimens;caring for MDR/XDR-TB cases in services with proper ventilation; andminimizing contact with other patients, particularly those with 
HIV, especially in the early stages before treatment has had a chance to
 reduce the infectiousness."
"Can the TB vaccine, known as BCG, prevent XDR-TB?","The BCG vaccine prevents severe forms of TB in children, such as 
TB meningitis, but is less effective in preventing pulmonary TB in 
adults, the most common and most infectious form of TB. It is expected 
that the effectiveness of BCG against XDR-TB is similar as for ordinary 
TB. Nevertheless, new vaccines are urgently needed, and WHO is actively 
advocating for the development of new vaccines."
What is the link between XDR-TB and HIV/AIDS? Why in some places is XDR-TB linked with HIV?,"People living with HIV are at greater risk of developing TB – 
as well as XDR-TB – than people without HIV, because of their weakened 
immunity. In few places where XDR-TB strains circulate more frequently, 
people with HIV are therefore more likely to be infected with XDR-TB 
than elsewhere. To date, in most of the places with high rates of HIV 
infection, XDR-TB has not been widespread.For this reason, the majority of people with HIV who develop 
TB will have ordinary TB and can be treated with standard first-line 
anti-TB drugs. For those with HIV infection, treatment with 
antiretroviral drugs will likely reduce the risk of developing XDR-TB, 
just as it does with ordinary TB. Patients with both XDR-TB and HIV who 
do not receive antiretroviral drugs are at high risk of dying."
How can I tell if I might have TB or XDR-TB?,"XDR-TB can only be diagnosed in a well-equipped laboratory. 
Symptoms of XDR-TB are no different from ordinary TB: a cough with 
thick, cloudy mucus (or sputum), sometimes with blood, for more than 2 
weeks; fever, chills, and night sweats; fatigue and muscle weakness; 
weight loss; and in some cases shortness of breath and chest pain. If 
you have these symptoms, it does not mean you have XDR-TB.But it does mean you must go and see a doctor for a check-up. 
If you are already on treatment for TB, and at least some of these 
symptoms are not improving after a few weeks of medication, you should 
inform your clinician or nurse."
How quickly can XDR-TB be diagnosed?,"If TB bacteria are found in the sputum, the diagnosis of TB can be
 made in a day or two. To confirm XDR-TB, however, it may take from 6 to
 16 weeks."
Is it safe to travel to places where XDR-TB has been identified?,"XDR-TB is still very rare but has been documented in many 
countries. People who are most at risk, if they do come into contact 
with someone with XDR-TB, are those with reduced immunity to infectious 
diseases, such as those with HIV infection or other medical conditions 
that can weaken a person's immunity.It is also advised that such people should avoid areas where 
there are no infection control measures in place. Air travel carries 
only very minimal risks of infection with any kind of TB. Concerned 
travellers should seek advice before their visit from their doctor, 
national authorities, or trusted travel web sites."
What should be done if a person has been in contact with a known or suspected case of XDR-TB?,"Anyone who has been in contact with someone known, or 
suspected of having, XDR-TB should consult their doctor or a local TB 
clinic and be screened to see if they have TB. This is most important if
 the person has any symptoms of TB. If they have a cough, they will be 
asked to provide a sample of sputum, which will be tested for evidence 
of TB disease.If TB is found, treatment will be started with the drugs to 
which the person’s TB is most likely to respond. If there is any 
evidence of infection with TB bacteria but without TB disease, 
preventive treatment may be given or the person may simply be asked to 
attend health services periodically for a check-up."
Should patients with XDR-TB be isolated while on treatment or after treatment options have failed?,"In order to make the diagnosis, patients with suspected TB or 
XDR-TB are sometimes admitted to hospital. In order to protect other 
patients and health workers in the hospital, isolation of such patients 
is part of good quality care. Once the diagnosis is made and treatment 
begun, for patients who are willing to undergo treatment, isolation is 
usually neither necessary nor appropriate.Isolation has a very limited role to play in patients in whom 
treatment has failed. Studies have shown that treating TB patients at 
home with appropriate infection measures in place generally poses no 
substantial risk to other members of the household. By the time a 
diagnosis is made, the household contacts have already been exposed to 
the patient’s infection.However, in the absence of options for curative treatment, all
 infection control measures at household should be strengthened. 
Whenever this is not feasible then options for voluntary isolation and 
delivery of palliative and end of life care should be offered to the 
patient."
"What risks do health-care workers face with XDR-TB, particularly those who may be HIV-positive themselves?","To protect health-care workers who may come into contact with 
infectious TB patients, appropriate and strict infection control 
measures must be implemented in health-care facilities at all times. 
Health-care workers are also encouraged to make sure that they are aware
 of their HIV status so that they can restrict putting themselves at 
risk of exposure."
What is WHO doing to combat XDR-TB?,"Firstly, WHO is ensuring that the health authorities responsible 
for TB care and control receive accurate information about XDR-TB. The 
latest information on XDR-TB, and related TB issues, are published on 
the WHO Global TB Programme website.Secondly, WHO advises that good TB prevention, care and 
control prevents the emergence of drug resistance in the first place, 
and that the proper treatment of MDR-TB prevents the emergence of 
XDR-TB.Thirdly, WHO is regularly updating its guidance to Ministries 
of Health on the management of drug-resistant TB patients and diagnostic
 policies."

Can countries submit a regional readiness proposal?,"Several countries can develop a regional-level readiness proposal.  Each country included in the proposal must contribute a part of their USD 1 million cap and all countries will benefit from the activities. For example, if five countries are submitting a proposal, one of the five must submit the proposal to the GCF and all of the countries must submit a financial support letter indicating how much each country is contributing to this proposal. Not every country must contribute the same amount to the proposal. For example, if five countries develop a regional readiness proposal and each agrees to contribute USD 300k, the total readiness proposal value will be USD 1.5 million. Another example is if two countries contribute USD 400k and three countries contribute 100k, then the total readiness proposal value will be USD 1.1 million."
2. Is it possible for a country to join a regional proposal and at the same time submit country-level readiness funding proposals?,"Yes. Countries can submit proposals for up to USD 1 million per year. National Designated Authorities (NDAs) may have multiple readiness grants under implementation simultaneously. If a country joins a regional proposal and agrees to contribute USD 300k, for example, and they have no other readiness projects for that year, then the remaining USD 700k can be sought for other country-level readiness activities."
3. Who submits a regional readiness proposal?,"A regional readiness proposal is submitted by a ""Lead"" Nationally Designated Authority (NDA) with support letters from the NDAs of all other participating countries."
4. How are regional readiness projects coordinated?,"The regional-level coordination will depend upon the specific projects and country contexts. NDAs have national level coordination mechanisms which will need to be considered in planning regional level coordination.However, regional coordination for a readiness project where WHO is the delivery partner will usually be managed by the WHO Regional Office with WHO Headquarters providing high level coordination and advice."
"5. For regional projects, how are funds disbursed to multiple countries?","Funding is dispersed to the readiness Delivery Partner and not directly to participating countries.For regional readiness projects where WHO is the delivery partner WHO HQ will receive funds directly from the GCF. These funds can then be transferred to the WHO regional or country office depending on approved activities and implementation arrangement of the proposal.  Funds can only be transferred to an approved GCF delivery partner or to implementation partners contracted through established, transparent procurement processes."
6. Can a country submit its own readiness proposal related to health on an individual basis and not on regional basis?,Yes.
1. What are multi-year readiness proposals and what type of activities are eligible?,"Multi-year strategic readiness (or ‘multi-year cap’) proposals can be submitted for readiness activities that will be implemented over multiple years that allocate up to USD 3 million, up to a maximum of 36 months. Support requests must be greater than USD 1 million and up to a maximum of USD 3 million (capped at USD 1 million/country/year). Essentially, this type of proposal allows the NDA to use subsequent calendar years’ USD 1 million cap and apply it to a single proposal.   The main purpose of a multi-year proposal is to allow countries to be more programmatic in their approach to readiness and to address specific identified needs and priorities. Countries and delivery partners should carefully read the conditions for submission in the guidebook for this type of readiness proposal. Regular readiness proposals (or ‘single-year cap’) proposals can be implemented over more than 12 months however, the proposal budget must be within the USD 1 million cap for the year of proposal approval.Figure adopted from Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme Guidebook"
2. Who can apply for a multi-year proposal?,"All developing countries may submit these proposals, provided that the NDA:Has a finalized Country Programme that contains an analysis of the country’s readiness needs;ORHas undertaken a readiness needs assessment and developed a work plan to address those needs.If the NDA does not meet these requirements, the needs assessment may be included as an activity in a regular readiness proposal so that in the future a multi-year proposal can be submitted."
3. Is there a specific template for the Needs Assessment?,"There is no template, however the Readiness Guidebook provides guidance on key areas for inclusion in the assessment.  Furthermore, if your country has needs assessments that have already been developed you are encouraged to submit those to your GCF regional officers for review and provide an opinion as to whether they are adequate for this proposal process."
4. Is it possible to have more than one delivery partner in a multi-year proposal?,"No, as with regular readiness proposals, there must be a lead delivery partner that is responsible for the project."
5. Is the proposal documentation the same for a multi-year readiness proposal?,"Existing templates should be used to develop and submit a multi-year readiness proposal.  However, there are some additional requirements for a multi-year proposal.  A needs assessment is recommended for a regular readiness proposal but is required for a multi-year proposal (this may have already been conducted as part of a finalized Country Programme).   This assessment should be conducted/overseen by the NDA and include, but not be limited to, health.  If a separate health sector needs assessment is conducted, it should be linked to, and expand on, the health needs identified overall needs assessment.The documents must cover the entire envisioned grant term.  Indicative work plans and budgets for each 12-month period of the proposal must be included in the overall proposal.More information on the needs assessment, and other requirements for the multi-year proposals, can be found in the Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme Guidebook."
6. Are there any differences for implementation of multi-year proposals?,For multi-year proposals the NDA must submit 12-month work plans and budgets for GCF approval on an annual basis.  The work plans include: updated logframe; budget and procurement plan; risk management strategy; and lessons learned from implementation to date and how the NDA and delivery partner have incorporated those lessons to improve the next stage of implementation.  Milestones from the previous 12-month work plan must be achieved to unlock approval for subsequent annual workplans.
7. Are multi-year proposals separate to the USD 1 million cap?,"No. The annual readiness cap remains in place and the Secretariat can only commit up to USD 1 million per calendar year. Therefore, for a multi-year proposal no more than USD 1 million per year can be programmed."
8. Can I submit more than one readiness proposal?,Yes. Countries may submit and implement both multi-year and regular readiness proposals provided that the USD 1 million per year cap is not exceeded.
What is the purpose of the WHO Learning Strategy?,"The purpose of the WHO Learning Strategy is to create a culture that redefines and establishes the norm of lifelong learning in public health, removing barriers to learning and promoting excellence to improve people’s health using the most effective education standards and adult learning know-how. It will propose a framework and approach by WHO on learning and training for its own workforce, as well as how it will support learning externally, across diverse sectors, for the achievement of global, national and individual health goals, to ensure people achieve the best levels of health possible."
For whom is the WHO Learning Strategy intended?,"The Learning Strategy is intended to be considered by and implemented by WHO, as a learning organization and as an organization supporting the learning of Member States, partners, institutions and other key stakeholders in all relevant sectors. The Strategy is aimed at users of health knowledge, producers of health knowledge, catalysers – enablers of health knowledge – and decision‑makers, who make decisions related to learning and training in public health."
Why do we need a WHO Learning Strategy?,"Only 5% of countries are currently on track to meet the Sustainable Development Goal 3 on health by 2030. This means that even the most basic health targets will not be reached thereby impacting on the survival, health and well-being of people in all countries. At the national level, studies indicate that it can take up to 10 years for global health guidance to be operationalized to help improve people’s health at the front line. This is compounded by the lack of universal access to lifelong learning by the most important agents of change for health, health workers, decision-makers and the public."
Who will implement the WHO Learning Strategy?,"Within the World Health Organization, the proposed WHO Academy will be facilitating and monitoring the implementation of the Strategy."
When will the WHO Learning Strategy be ready?,"The WHO Learning Strategy is currently being drafted and it will be subject to internal reviews within WHO and external, expert consultations, before being published, in quarter 4 2020."
What are the benefits of the WHO Learning Strategy?,"The WHO Learning Strategy will guide WHO’s approach to learning in health to accelerate the achievement of international, national and individual health goals ensuring rights, equity, quality, safety and access; harnessing the potential of digital technologies; and using adult learning and behavioural change know-how. The Learning Strategy will not replace academic and other formal training of public health professionals. Its focus will be on operational public health. The Strategy is not limited to learners in the human health sector but is inclusive of all audiences."
Who will pay for the WHO Learning Strategy?,"The WHO Learning Strategy is being developed by a dedicated team, within the WHO Academy. WHO is covering the limited costs, but many experts, institutions, UN agencies and volunteers are helping for free the development of the Strategy. France is contributing towards the establishment of the Academy, including resources required to develop the Learning Strategy (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/24-02-2020-france-pledges-us100-million-for-who-academy)"
What is the WHO Academy?,"The WHO Academy will be the World Health Organization’s state-of-the-art training centre, bringing the very latest lifelong learning innovations to the global health sector.  Now under development with the support of France, the Academy will scale up learning for impact through online and classroom-based courses, reaching millions of health workers and others around the world.  Using the latest technologies, it will enable learners to tailor their training experience to meet their needs and award them digital credentials they can use to verify their competencies and advance their careers."
Who is the Academy targeting and what will it offer them?,"The Academy will expand access to critical knowledge to millions health workers, managers, public health officials and policy makers – as well as the WHO’s own staff throughout the world, along with everyday people who provide care in their own homes and communities.  It will deliver multilingual, personalized digital learning that can be accessed remotely, plus hybrid learning that combines the strengths of digital and in-person learning experiences. The Academy will also be one of the world’s leading centres of learning and simulation on health emergency preparedness and response, as well as on disease outbreak control."
Where will the WHO Academy be located?,"WHO Academy courses will be globally accessible via its online learning experience platform, supported by onsite training at a futuristic “hub” campus in Lyon, France, and at regional “spokes” facilities around the world."
When will the WHO Academy begin offering courses?,"The first set of WHO Academy courses will be available online in May 2021, while the Lyon hub campus will open in 2023."
Why is the WHO Academy needed?,"Only a handful of countries are on track to meet all the health-related targets of the SDGs.  A big part of the reason is it often takes a decade or more to bring the world’s health workforce up to speed on advancements in health science and practices. But new methods and technologies in adult learning can vastly improve the speed, efficiency and scale with which critical knowledge is conveyed to people around the world.  As the world’s largest and most innovative lifelong learning platform in global health, the WHO Academy will accelerate the implementation of the latest norms, standards and evidence and thereby equip health workers and others to save lives and make their societies healthier."
Why is the WHO so interested in improving adult learning and training?,"Advancements in the health sciences are growing exponentially, but the latest knowledge and evidence-based guidance needed by health workers and others to improve outcomes is not getting to them quickly, efficiently and effectively.  Because of this, it often takes more than a decade to put important life-saving guidelines into actual practice – by which time the science has likely changed several times over.  As one example, the science and knowledge surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic is doubling every 20 days.  We need to vastly shorten the time that it takes to get information and training opportunities to health workers, public health officials, policy makers and others involved in improving global health.  And that’s what the WHO Academy will focus on doing."
Why should WHO be the organization that takes on the challenge of revolutionizing lifelong learning in health?,"WHO is mandated by its own constitution to be a learning organization and to convey the latest evidence, norms, standards and practice to the worldwide healthcare community.  The organization currently provides more than 1,400 digital and onsite training courses reaching a million people annually, including the organization’s own staff and outside learners throughout the global health sector.  The WHO Academy team includes experts in health, adult learning, behavioural insight, communications, quality and standards, research, governance, workforce development and performance and the latest learning technologies. This combined with WHO’s talent with its 14,000-person workforce, regional outreach, presence in 140 countries, over 800 collaborating centres and hundreds of expert networks provides a robust basis to transform lifelong learning in health."
Why aren’t the lifelong learning approaches we’ve been using for years good enough to help address these challenges?,"Our own experience tells us that classroom-based training is expensive and almost impossible to scale to the numbers of people we need to reach worldwide.  It cannot support a rapidly growing health workforce nor can it be adequately tailored to the unique needs of individual learners. Meanwhile, much of today’s online learning lacks adaptation to address specific needs of learners and opportunities for hands-on practice, collaboration and verification of competencies gained. Studies have pinpointed numerous shortcomings in existing learning programmes, finding that many of them have only minimal impact on the behaviour and performance of health workers.  Additionally, WHO’s training programmes and courses are currently spread over 20 separate platforms, which are usually not interconnected or interoperable, not often accessible via smart phones, and not deploying the latest methods in how adults learn, how they retain information, and how they build competencies."
What is going to be different about the WHO Academy vis-à-vis the adult learning systems currently in existence?,"The WHO Academy is building a system that will provide vastly more effective and impactful learning at a much greater scale than is now possible.  Learners will be able to access a full scope of courses on the Academy’s digital learning experience platform – via computer, laptop, tablet, and mobile phone – through a single profile and login.  It will implement a user-centred, immersive and hyper-personalized approach that supports and coaches users on their individualized learning pathways, and facilitates the ongoing development of their competencies and practices.  And the Academy’s digital credentialing system will enable those who successfully complete courses to be certified with “digital badges” that they can show to employers and regulatory agencies to help advance their careers."
How will the WHO Academy change lifelong learning in global health?  What new approaches will it bring?,"The WHO Academy will leverage the latest learning technologies and innovations in the science of adult learning.  Digital innovations such as artificial intelligence, extended reality, gamification and blockchain have enabled training to become more immersive, engaging and effective. Technology-driven experiential learning recognizes what trainees already know and can tailor the experience to an individual learner’s needs – and verify the competencies they gain. It is now possible to deliver sophisticated training programmes – with realistic simulations, personalization to user needs and intense collaboration among learners in various locations – to smartphones, mobile learning laboratories and other devices located almost anywhere in the world.  These are some of the technologies and innovations the Academy will deploy as it rolls out its curriculum."
Tell me more about the Academy’s certification and accreditation system.,"The WHO Academy will develop and implement an accreditation governance model that meets the requirements of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and includes an open certification management system to support all learning programmes.  It will develop and set standards for the Academy’s learning outcomes and an open certification management system, and use blockchain and other technologies to validate learning outcomes and issue recognized and verifiable micro-credentials and interoperable digital learning records to learners who successfully demonstrate new skills or competencies.  The Academy will engage with regulatory authorities responsible for the accreditation and recognition of education, training and regulation of professional practice in the health sector to develop an open certification scheme that recognizes lifelong learning."
What improvements will the Academy bring to the WHO’s own staff training and development programmes?,"With the WHO Academy, we are building something new and better that will boost the value of WHO’s existing training programmes, along with its value as a learning institution, and ultimately have enormous impact on our ability as an organization to deliver on the health-related SDGs.  As a prestigious and world-renown learning institution, the WHO Academy will also provide new opportunities for staff members to do their jobs better. With upgraded technologies and approaches to in-house training, it will strengthen pathways for WHO employees to gain new skills and competencies and, with those, new opportunities for career advancement."
What role will WHO staff play in the development of the WHO Academy?,"The bulk of existing training programmes – both in-house and for outside learners – have been developed and are administered by WHO staff, and for the Academy to be successful and to have global impact, it will need the support, ideas and participation from our colleagues.  The Academy’s approach is grounded in a flexible co-design process that invites subject matter experts within our WHO community to help develop the prototypes and courses that will be a part of the Academy’s digital and hybrid/classroom curriculum. The first courses to be offered by the Academy at its May 2021 launch will emerge from a co-design course development programme involving colleagues from across WHO departments and programmes, and which is currently underway."
Will the WHO Academy help develop solutions to stop the spread of COVID-19?,"With the spread of COVID-19, the WHO Academy team developed a mobile learning app that would more quickly and efficiently put up-to-the-minute information from across WHO onto the phones and tablets of health workers, so that they could keep up with evolving guidance and science on the pandemic and be better able to care for patients and protect themselves from infection.  The app delivers mobile access to a wealth of COVID-19 knowledge resources developed by WHO, including the very latest guidance, as well as learning tools, training, and virtual workshops.  The app, which is frequently updated to offer new features, is available in seven languages – Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish – in the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store."
"How can outside stakeholders, such as representatives from WHO Member States, get involved?","The WHO Academy will be assembling a high-level external advisory group, as well as a number of expert groups. An expression of interest process will be established to develop partnerships and collaborations with organizations and institutions to work with the Academy.  A WHO Academy expert roster has already been established to develop a pool of global multi-lingual experts in learning technologies, learning science and other key areas.  And the process of creating the curriculum will eventually offer numerous opportunities for stakeholders to partner with us in course design or as faculty members, as will efforts to develop learning innovations and technologies for the Academy."
"For a country to achieve UHC, does it have to provide all interventions within the Repository?","Essential service packages vary across countries depending on current capacity, resource availability, and priorities. Expanding service provision in the context of UHC may entail starting with a smaller guaranteed package and then expanding the number of services covered."
How can I use the data in the Repository to inform Benefit Packages in my setting?,WHO provides guidance and tools to support priority setting and planning within a local context. See http://who.int/choice
Why is a specific intervention not in the Repository?,"This may be for a number of reasons: (i) WHO may have examined the evidence for the intervention but a decision was made not to recommend it (ii) WHO may have recommended the intervention a long time ago but has not issued recent recommendations (iii) WHO has not yet examined the evidence base for the intervention (iv) the intervention is considered a policy or system level investment and is thus not covered directly in the Repository database, but will be included in the accompanying inventory on facility and system investments."
How often will the Repository be updated?,"The data within the Repository will be updated on a regular basis to reflect updates in WHO published recommendations on interventions, to ensure the most up to date information is reflected."
What is the meaning of the two categories of WHO documents within the Compendium database? (WHO GRC-approved guideline and Other WHO reference documents),"WHO produces different types of guidance documents. The Guidelines review committee (GRC) and its Secretariat support guideline developers and ensure the quality of a certain type of guidance document produced by WHO, via an internal, peer-review process.  In addition, WHO produces a wide range of publications that contain guidance on clinical and public health interventions and policies, many of which are not suitable for review by the GRC.  When such guidance is linked to an intervention in the Compendium it is referred to as “other WHO reference documents”  within the database .  The importance of an intervention is not determined by the type of guidance document listed in the Compendium. Rather, Member States should select interventions prioritized to their needs, from across the items in the Compendium."
"For interventions listed on the Compendium web-site, what does “Reference document under review” mean?","When WHO has not published specific guidance on a listed intervention, the intervention is labelled “Reference document under review”.  This means that the intervention is considered important to include, but there is currently no WHO guidance published."
When will an extended version of the database be posted?,"The current version of the database includes selected information on intervention tags, target populations and service delivery platforms. WHO is currently working to expand the database both in terms of breadth (number of interventions) and depth (information shown for each intervention). Updates will be published later in 2020."
How should we cite the UHC Intervention Repository?,"Please follow the following information to cite the Repository: UHC Intervention Repository (Internet), World Health Organization. Available from --- URL. Accessed on [Date]."
Why has the handbook been produced?,"As countries begin national efforts to improve quality of care, many have recognized the benefits of
developing a coherent plan that provides structure, guidance and direction on quality at all levels of
the health system. NQPS can help clarify the linkages with national health policies, plans and
priorities, can highlight the importance of quality-focused processes in achieving overall health
priorities, and also help to define lines of accountability to work towards quality people-centred
health services. This handbook aims to support the process of developing NQPS. The handbook is
not a prescriptive guide, but rather a structured approach that helps ensure that the development
and implementation of NQPS are as comprehensive and smooth as possible."
Who is the handbook intended for?,"This handbook is designed to support those governments and policy-makers (at the national, state
and provincial levels) considering whether and how to develop an NQPS or those already in the
process of developing one. It may also be helpful for technical advisers, donors and other
stakeholders supporting governments in areas related to NQPS. While much of this handbook has
been designed to support the development of NQPS in low- and middle-income countries, which
may face particular challenges to improving quality of care, the processes outlined are relevant to
any national or subnational authority preparing or reviewing their national efforts on quality of care."
Why does the handbook focus on both policy and strategy?,"While terminology varies between different countries and organizations, the handbook proposes
that there is value in countries developing both a quality policy and a strategy. The policy is a
statement of the vision, direction and rationale for the national effort to improve quality of care, and
may outline broad priorities to be addressed. It may be expressed in a number of different ways, for
example as a separate policy document, a national quality statement, or as part of a broader
national health policy document. Policy can be a useful tool for engaging stakeholders, building
support for the national quality effort and establishing the structures and environment needed for
success. The strategy then goes on to provide a clear explanation of how the policy will be put into
practice, including detail on how each of the priorities will be met, and provides a clear framework
for organizing the initiative. Strategy provides the level of detail needed to drive implementation.
Policy and strategy should, of course, be developed and applied in an integrated manner, taking
account of country needs and context."
How does this link to countries’ national health planning processes?,"Each country will approach the development of NQPS differently, but the handbook stresses the
critical importance of integration with existing health plans and priorities. Development of NQPS
should build on and complement the national health planning process. Quality is a key consideration as countries move towards universal health coverage, and the success of NQPS requires action all
the way across the health system. For more information on national health policy and planning,
please see the WHO Health Systems Governance webpage."
Is this a WHO guideline?,"No. This handbook outlines an approach towards the development of NQPS and has been co-developed with the input of countries that have embarked on their own national quality efforts, as
well as technical partners, and experts from across WHO. It has also been informed by a review of
existing national policies and strategies."
"Does the handbook address disease and population specific quality initiatives, such as those for HIV and maternal and child health?","In many countries, existing disease or population specific programmes are already engaged in
important work to improve the quality of care, and these can be key assets to supporting the
development and implementation of NQPS. This handbook discusses options for meaningful
integration of NQPS and relevant technical programmes, but envisages that further resources will
then be developed to support these efforts. Further information on the Quality of Care Network for
Maternal, Newborn and Child Health is available here."
Does the handbook propose suggested indicators for measuring quality of care?,"Measuring quality of care is extremely difficult and complex. The handbook outlines a basic
approach to strengthening information systems and selecting indicators to support NQPS, and
proposes carrying out a review of existing illustrative indicator lists as part of this process. The focus
is on quality measurement that is achievable, of practical value, and context-specific. Further
resources are available in the accompanying tools compendium, available on the WHO Global Learning Laboratory for Quality UHC."
Why does the handbook not describe quality improvement methods?,"The handbook focuses on the process for developing national policy and strategy on quality of care,
which can provide structure to national initiatives. Quality improvement plays a critical role in
improving processes across the health care system, and dedicated training and reference materials
are available from a number of specialist technical organizations on this aspect."
How does the handbook relate to WHO’s work on patient safety and infection prevention and control?,"Infection prevention and control (IPC) and patient safety are critical foundations for achieving quality
care. While the handbook focuses specifically on the development of national policy and strategy,
WHO has produced detailed technical resources to support assessment and interventions for IPC
and patient safety, both of which may be key early action areas within a national effort to improve
quality of care."
How can I access and share global learning on quality of care?,"The WHO Global Learning Laboratory (GLL) for Quality UHC links the experiences, expertise, passion
and wisdom of people across the world, representing multiple disciplines, on important issues
relating to quality in the context of UHC. The focus is to accelerate global learning informed by local
action in the area of quality service delivery."
What further support is available to countries developing national quality policy and strategy?,"The handbook is supplemented by a compendium of tools and resources, which provides tools,
country examples and other knowledge products that can be used by teams developing national
quality policy and strategy. The compendium is available on The WHO Global Learning Laboratory (GLL) for Quality UHC within the NQPS learning pod, providing a “safe space” in which tools and
resources can be shared, discussed, refined and adapted.
WHO continues to respond to country requests for technical support to develop national quality
policy and strategy, through country offices, regional offices and at WHO headquarters."
Are further versions of the handbook planned?,"The approach outlined in the handbook will continue to be refined, based on learning shared by
countries developing national quality policy and strategy. Further tools and resources will be collated
and developed based on country need.Translations of the handbook into other WHO languages are also planned."
What causes Chagas disease?,Chagas disease is an infectious disease caused by the parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi.
What are the symptoms of Chagas disease?,"After infection, you will experience two phases, consequently: acute and chronic. The acute phase lasts about two months. Symptoms are mostly absent or mild and unspecific.However, less than half of those bitten by a triatomine bug show the first visible signs, such as a skin lesion or a purplish swelling of the lid of one eye. Additionally, some may have fever, headache, enlarged lymph glands, pallor, muscle pain, difficulty in breathing, swelling, and abdominal or chest pain.During the chronic phase, up to 30% of patients suffer from cardiac disorders and up to 10% are affected by digestive conditions (typically enlargement of the oesophagus or colon), neurological or mixed changes.In later years infection can lead to a sudden death due to irregular heartbeat or progressive heart failure caused by the destruction of the heart muscle and its nervous system."
How can Chagas disease be transmitted?,"Chagas disease transmission can happen in different ways, through:  1) vectorial transmission, when the person comes into contact with the stools/urine of infected triatomine bugs, through an opened wound, the mouth or the eyes (not due to their bite); 2) oral transmission through the ingestion of food contaminated by the stools/urine of infected triatomine bugs, typically causing outbreaks of oral transmission;3) congenital transmission from mothers to children, in pregnancy or childbirth; 4) transfusional transmission through blood or blood derivatives from infected donors; 5) organ transplantation transmission through organ or tissue transplants from infected donors; 6) laboratorial transmission in laboratory accidents, especially with the parasite culture and the handling of infected samples.However, it is not transmitted through: - hand shakes - kisses- hugs and - sexual relations.Breastfeeding is not contraindicated."
Where are the Chagas disease cases most frequently detected?,"While most of the affected population lives in Latin America, in the last decades cases have been increasingly detected in the USA, Canada, many European countries and some African, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific countries."
"Currently, where do most people with Chagas disease live in? Rural areas or cities?","Insects transmitting Chagas disease (triatomine bugs, called “kissing bugs”, among many other popular names) are usually in rural or peri-urban areas of Latin America. However, due to urbanization, since the 1980s, infected people mostly live in urban areas."
"To know if I have Chagas disease, which test that I should take?","The following tests are especially recommended:- parasitological tests: in the acute phase (around the first two months of infection);- serological tests: in the chronic phase, to detect antibodies against the parasite."
Is there any effective treatment for Chagas disease?,"Treatment for Chagas disease ranges from eliminating the parasite T. cruzi to dealing with clinical manifestations and complications, including psychological, familial, labor and social security support."
Why is the disease burden attributable to risk factors being estimated?,"For many health policy decisions regarding prevention and intervention, it is important to know which risk factors are most important for population health, so the available resources can be spent most efficiently to improve the health of entire populations. To this end, it is necessary to quantify the burden caused by diseases and injuries which can be attributed to known risk factors in a comprehensive and comparable way. This requires an integration of knowledge about the “dangerousness” of a risk factor (this is usually assessed as the relative risk for a specific disease-risk factor combination) and the “frequency and level of exposure” (how many people in a population are exposed to which quantities of the risk factor). Following the well-established method outlined below, disease burden from different risk factors such as lack of physical activity, smoking or air pollution can be calculated and compared and changes over time (for example after an intervention that reduced air pollution) can be assessed."
What is meant by attributable disease burden?,"The attributable burden is the share of the burden of disease that can be estimated to occur due to exposure to a particular risk factor. The disease burden (for example deaths, years of life lost or years lived with disability) attributable to a risk factor is the disease burden that would not have occurred if people had not been exposed to the risk factor in the past. Given that the basis of the information is all rooted in the past (exactly like in case of deriving the life-expectancy), the notion that the burden had not occurred without the exposure is based on several assumptions. The concept of attributable disease burden or the attributable risk fraction is schematically shown in the figure below."
What is the population attributable fraction?,"For many health policy decisions regarding prevention and intervention, it is important to know which risk factors are most important for population health, so the available resources can be spent most efficiently to improve the health of entire populations. To this end, it is necessary to quantify the burden caused by diseases and injuries which can be attributed to known risk factors in a comprehensive and comparable way. This requires an integration of knowledge about the “dangerousness” of a risk factor (this is usually assessed as the relative risk for a specific disease-risk factor combination) and the “frequency and level of exposure” (how many people in a population are exposed to which quantities of the risk factor). Following the well-established method outlined below, disease burden from different risk factors such as lack of physical activity, smoking or air pollution can be calculated and compared and changes over time (for example after an intervention that reduced air pollution) can be assessed."
How is the population attributable fraction calculated?,"Two types of information are needed to estimate the population attributable fraction (PAF):the proportions of the population exposed to the risk factor (p_i) for each level of exposure, andthe relative risk (RR) associated with exposure, usually based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses including the results of all relevant epidemiological studies complying with certain criteria. The RR provides the ratio of the probabilities to get a certain disease or to die due to a disease when two differently exposed groups are compared.A common form of the formula for estimating the PAF is the following. It can accommodate several exposure levels which a population can be exposed to (2):where pi is the proportion of the population exposed at exposure level i, p'i is the counterfactual exposure distribution and RRi is the relative risk at exposure level i. The counterfactual exposure distribution is the exposure level with no or very low disease risk (i.e., RR of 1).A simplified formula applicable to only two levels of exposure (exposed and unexposed) is the following (3):These formulas assume no confounding or effect modification. Only RRs from studies of high quality epidemiological should be used in such assessments.Further readingWHO, 2004: Comparative Quantification of Health RisksWHO, 2003: Quantifying environmental health impacts: Introduction and methodsGBD 2017 Risk Factor Collaborator (2018) Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks for 195 countries and territories. 1990-2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.Lancet. 2018 Nov 10;392(10159):1923-1994. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32225-6."
How is the attributable burden of disease due to a risk factor calculated?,"Comparative risk assessment methods are the preferred methods used to estimate the burden of disease in a population attributable to a risk factor.The following ingredients are used for estimating the attributable disease burden:disease statistics for the population for the metric of interest (number of deaths, years of life lost [YLLs], years lived with disability [YLDs], or disability-adjusted life years [DALYs, the sum of YLLs and YLDs]),the counterfactual level of risk factor exposure which usually corresponds to an exposure where a minimum risk is incurred,the population attributable fraction (PAF), as described above, based on the distribution of the population into the various exposure levels for a risk factor, including the counterfactual exposure level, and the relative risk linking exposure and disease or other health outcomes.The attributable disease burden is then estimated by multiplying the total burden by the PAF for each age, sex, and relevant disease group.Further readingWHO, 2009: Global health risks: Mortality and burden of disease attributable to selected major risksGBD 2016 Risk Factor Collaborators, 2017: Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016Ezzati et al. 2002: Selected major risk factors and global and regional burden of diseaseWHO, 2003: Quantifying environmental health impacts: Introduction and methods"
"Is this approach widely applied, accepted and tested?","The World Health Organization (WHO) has been estimating the global burden of disease attributable to a risk factor using the described approach since about two decades (e.g., (4)). Since then, a very high number of peer-reviewed scientific articles and reports using the same methods have been published. The underlying methods have been described extensively (e.g., (5,6)). Other organizations and institutes have also been using these methods, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has been publishing burden of disease figures from a large list of risk factors in collaboration with about 2000 scientists from all over the world (7). The methods used in burden of disease assessments are in continuous discussion and improvement involving numerous scientists globally. This ensures a high-quality methodology used to estimates burden of disease. All assumptions used in such assessments need to be made transparent.Further readingGBD 2017 Risk Factor Collaborators, 2018: Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks for 195 countries and territories, 1990–2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017Ezzati et al. 2002: Selected major risk factors and global and regional burden of disease"
What are the requirements for applying the population attributable fraction (PAF) and what are its limitations?,"Burden of disease estimates should be regarded as approximate estimates. They however correspond to the state of the science, provided that certain conditions apply. The following issues need to be carefully verified/considered and to be made transparent: (a) The causality of the respective exposure-disease pairs has been assessed and validated; (b) the combined relative risks from epidemiological studies need to be free from confounding and effect modification and should be applicable to the relevant population groups; (c) the exposure definition used in the relative risk and the exposure estimates need to correspond; and (d) the relative risk estimates used for estimating population attributable fractions (PAFs) generally need to stem from pooled analyses of the available evidence, such as from rigorously performed meta-analyses.Further readingEzzati et al. 2002: Selected major risk factors and global and regional burden of disease"
Why do results differ between different agencies?,"Many different agencies/researchers have conducted burden of disease calculations following the outlined approach. Exposure estimates may vary according to the assessment method used. Countries may have additional exposure data and a finer resolution as compared to global assessments. Furthermore, epidemiological information is accruing with time, allowing estimates to improve in precision. All estimates should be fully documented in terms of assumptions made, refer to publicly available and easily accessible exposure estimates and be based on published meta-analyses to ensure transparency of estimates and allow for comparison between studies."
What do the population attributable fraction (PAF) and the estimated attributable disease burden NOT cover?,"The population attributable fractions (PAF) and attributable burden of disease assessments refer to whole populations and express the fraction of disease burden that could have been avoided if exposure were removed, but do not allow the designation of affected individuals. This means that it is not possible to determine who died earlier or contracted disease because of exposure to the risk factor at the individual level.The PAF may not fully capture morbidity and mortality that occurred earlier in time due to exposure (i.e., that occurred both in the exposed and the unexposed group, but earlier in the exposed group due to exposure).Further readingGreenland and Robins, 1988: Conceptual problems in the definition and interpretation of attributable fractionsCOMEAP, 2010: The Mortality Effects of Long-Term Exposure to Particulate Air Pollution in the United Kingdom"
What is the scope of the EUL?,"WHO has developed the EUL process to expedite the availability of unlicensed medical products needed in public health emergency situations, to assist interested United Nations procurement agencies and WHO Member States in determining the acceptability of using specific products in the context of a public health emergency, based on an essential set of available quality, safety, and efficacy/immunogenicity/ performance data."
Can WHO member states use the EUL as the basis to authorize the use of an unlicensed vaccine/medicine/In Vitro Diagnostics at the national level?,"Yes. Once a product has been assessed by WHO under the EUL procedure, the outcome will be published and it is the prerogative of each country to use this as the basis for their decision regarding the emergency use authorization of a product at the national level."
How is the EUL procedure different from Prequalification?,"The EUL is a special procedure for unlicensed vaccines, medicines and in vitro diagnostics in the event of a public health emergency when the community/public health authorities may be willing to tolerate less certainty about the efficacy and safety of products, given the morbidity and/or mortality of the disease and the lack or paucity of treatment, diagnosis/detection or prevention options. The procedure is intended to provide a time-limited listing for unlicensed products in an emergency context when limited data are available and the products are not yet ready for application for prequalification. As part of the EUL, the expectation is that the manufacturer will complete the development of the product and submit for licensure and WHO prequalification."
"Does the listing of a product assessed under the EUL procedure ensure safety, efficacy & performance of the product?","The assessment of products under the EUL procedure is conducted on the quality, safety, efficacy or performance data available up to the time of submission. However, since the product is still in development (vaccines and medicines only, IVDs under development are not accepted for assessment), the decision to list will be based on a risk-benefit assessment considering the public health emergency. The available data must provide an indication that the use of the product will provide a benefit to the target population."
What written standards are used to assess new products if there are no published guidelines for the specific product?,"The product evaluation committee will prepare a list of existing guidelines that are related to the vaccines and medicines, and published scientific data that may support the evaluation. This list of documents used as reference will be included in the report prepared by the product evaluation committee."
What are the factors that have an impact on the review timelines?,"For vaccines, the approval of the product for emergency use by a stringent NRA and the history of the manufacturer with prequalification. For medicines, whether the product has been authorized for emergency use by a stringent regulatory agency/WHO listed authority. For in vitro diagnostics whether the product has been assessed through another emergency mechanism of an acceptable standard."
Is emergency use approval required in the country of manufacture?,"No. However, when a product has already been assessed and authorized for use in emergency situations by the NRA of the country of manufacture, the assessment may have a shorter timeline as WHO may consider this evaluation to avoid duplication. The selection of assessment pathway, done in the pre-emergency phase, takes this into consideration."
Are manufacturers required to follow-up once a product is listed in the EUL and used in the field?,"Yes. Since vaccines and medicines assessed using the EUL procedure are still in development, the manufacturers must continue with product development and clinical trials towards registration and prequalification. The manufacturer must notify WHO of any change made to the product. In addition they must provide updated information, so the product evaluation committee reviews and updates their assessment report."
Does WHO need to evaluate a product that has already been approved by a NRA for use in public health emergencies?,"When the product submitted for EUL has been assessed through other emergency mechanisms by a SRA/WLA (for vaccines or medicines) WHO does not intend to duplicate work. However, WHO may still perform some assessment activities –if deemed necessary to provide a level of assurance of quality, safety, efficacy and performance of the products according to the settings in which the product will be used. In the case of vaccines, programmatic aspects are critical and are never assessed by the NRA of the manufacturing country as they refer to matters outside of the NRA’s jurisdiction. In general, in this case, the assessment pathway will consider the assessment by the NRA and may shorten the timeline significantly. For IVDs, WHO will perform an assessment independent of a prior NRA assessment."
Will WHO review only information on preclinical and clinical data to make a risk/benefit assessment?,"No. WHO will also review quality aspects (and performance in case of in vitro diagnostics). In addition to the data indicating safety and efficacy of the product, compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices is also a requirement."
How will monitoring and surveillance be performed post-listing?,"After a product has been listed, WHO will take into consideration reports on safety surveillance, efficacy/effectiveness/performance monitoring, quality complaints and other relevant data that may impact the validity of the listing status.The sources of such information will inter alia be based on existing surveillance mechanisms in affected countries (as discussed with relevant NRAs during the pre-emergency phase for vaccines and medicines) and on post-listing surveillance commitments of the manufacturer, set as conditions for the listing."
Is WHO able to de-list a product that has been granted an EUL?,Yes. Updated information from the manufacturer or from the field may alter the initial assessment of the risk/benefit profile used to support the initial decision.
Can a medical product be assessed under the EUL procedures for a new indication or subpopulation?,"Yes. An existing product that is found to be safe and efficacious for treatment of prevention of a disease in an emergency may be assessed. However, clinical data relevant to the use of such products in the new indication or subpopulation must be generated and submitted."
For how long can a product assessed under the EUL remain listed?,"The validity of an emergency use listing in the context of a public health emergency will generally be for 12 months. All decisions to list a product in the EUL will be reassessed at 12 months intervals (or sooner, if further data become available that could alter the original decision). When deemed necessary, the emergency use listing can be extended. Products may be taken off the EUL list earlier, if new data become available that change the benefit-risk balance of the product or immediately upon termination of the public health emergency."
How can I submit for EUL assessment?,"The manufacturer should first contact [email protected].The Prequalification (PQ)-IVD team
organizes a teleconference as the first step of the EUL process. Thereafter, we invite manufacturers
to submit an application letter if the manufacturer has conducted all the required minimum studies
in our instructions document. We prefer if manufacturers submit all information at one time rather
than partial data at multiple timepoints as it assists us to undertake a more efficient data review.
However, when this is not possible, manufacturers are encouraged to contact our Team to seek
guidance. Once we receive the application letter, we will prepare a letter of agreement, and ask the
manufacturer to submit their product dossier. The QMS documentation and product performance
data are reviewed in parallel. Firstly, the provided information is screened for completeness and (if
complete) then undergoes a technical assessment. We inform the manufacturer of the outcome of
each step and ask for more information where required."
What are the EUL timelines?,"The time to accepting the application letter is less than one week. Responses to screening and
dossier review takes six to eight weeks depending on the completeness of the information
submitted. If you have a question regarding your application that is currently under review, email
[email protected] and we will give an update as soon as we can. For queries about active
applications and products published on our website as emergency use listed, refer to the status
updates and public reports on our website or email [email protected].int and we will try to give you
as much information we can, understanding that we cannot share confidential information."
What IVD products are eligible for the abridged assessment pathway?,"IVDs to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid that have US FDA Emergency Use Authorization are eligible
for an abridged assessment pathway. For these applications, we accept the submission prepared for
the FDA. Note however that any additional requirements outlined in the WHO instructions
document must supplement the submission and the entire dossier will be assessed. We do not
abridge any other national regulatory authority approvals for NAT assays (such as CE-marking,
Chinese NMPA, ANVISA, Korea MFDS), nor any other types of IVDs."
We have conducted performance studies for our kit as per national regulatory authority requirements. Do we have to repeat these studies for the EUL if they do not completely align with WHO EUL instructions?,"We understand that time and specimens are critical. We will work with the data that you have
available at the time of submission and discuss your application in detail during the presubmission
call. Submit any data that has been generated that can help us evaluate your assay more
comprehensively. We publish minimum requirements in our instructions document that we require
all manufacturers to meet. As the pandemic evolves and more evidence becomes, we are updating
our minimum requirements. The most recent version is posted on our website."
What is the relationship between the performance studies such as the study organized by FIND and the EUL?,"Currently, several performance evaluations of SARS-CoV-2 IVDs are being implemented by
regulatory authorities, reference laboratories and other stakeholders in various regions.
Manufacturer are strongly encouraged to participate in initiatives which generate evidence that can
be used to support the EUL submission, However, participation in external evaluations does not
replace the EUL submission nor is participation in such studies mandatory for submission to the
WHO EUL."
Does the EUL expression of interest include multiplex NAT assays which detect other respiratory pathogens in addition to SARS-CoV-2?,"PQT-IVD are not accepting applications for multiplex NAT assays that detect other respiratory
pathogens in addition to SARS-CoV-2 to the EUL assessment procedure."
I am developing a SARS-CoV-2 assay and preparing to submit to the EUL. What instructions should I follow?,"We have published different instructions depending on the assay type on our website to assist in the
preparation of the EUL submission. As the pandemic evolves and more scientific evidence becomes 
PQT_IVD_Q&A_200806version1 Page 3 of 3
available, these instructions may change. It is recommended to verify that you are using the most
recent version of instructions which are posted on our website."
"I am submitting a RT-PCR kit to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, do I have to include the extraction step in my validation studies?","Yes, the extraction step must be considered for all analytical and clinical performance studies. It is essential that the limit of detection is determined in each specimen type claimed using all extraction kits recommended in the instructions for use."
Do I need to provide detailed information regarding specimen collection and storage?,"More and more evidence is emerging as to how critical appropriate specimen collection and storage is in the testing process, and the potential impacts it can have on the IVD kit sensitivity. PQT-IVD consider it essential that the manufacturer fully understands the impact of the viral transport media (VTM) or other means recommended in the instructions for use as users will follow this information. If commercial VTM, in-house developed VTM or other storage solutions are recommended, it is essential that the manufacturer has evidence of its performance in the claimed specimen type."
I cannot get access to the full list of organisms that are required for NAT assay cross- reactivity studies. Can WHO source these specimens or conduct testing on our behalf?,"PQT-IVD team are not undertaking any laboratory evaluation on manufacturers behalf. However, we understand that some organisms are proving difficult to source in different jurisdictions. As long as manufacturers can demonstrate that they have made adequate attempts to source these specimens, we can accept the testing to be submitted at an agreed later timepoint when the manufacturer can access these specimens. We will review the overall dataset and accept that there might be some small gaps in the dossier where other sections have been addressed completely."
"In our clinical evidence studies, we have not used a comparator assay that is recommended in your instructions document. Do we have to repeat the clinical studies?","No, we will not necessarily request you to repeat your clinical evidence studies without reviewing the data you already have available. Please provide a justification for how you have chosen your comparator assay. We would expect that a minimum, that you have knowledge of the comparator assay primers and probes and that they are not the same sequences as used in your assay. As part of the dossier submission. PQT-IVD will consider this information as part of the total dossier."
What is vaccine-derived polio?,"Oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains an attenuated (weakened) 
vaccine-virus, activating an immune response in the body. When a child 
is immunized with OPV, the weakened vaccine-virus replicates in the 
intestine for a limited period, thereby developing immunity by building 
up antibodies. During this time, the vaccine-virus is also excreted. In 
areas of inadequate sanitation, this excreted vaccine-virus can spread 
in the immediate community (and this can offer protection to other 
children through ‘passive’ immunization), before eventually dying out.  
		On rare occasions, if a population is seriously 
under-immunized, an excreted vaccine-virus can continue to circulate for
 an extended period of time. The longer it is allowed to survive, the 
more genetic changes it undergoes. In very rare instances, the 
vaccine-virus can genetically change into a form that can paralyse – 
this is what is known as a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus 
(cVDPV).It takes a long time for a cVDPV to occur. Generally, the 
strain will have been allowed to circulate in an un- or under-immunized 
population for a period of at least 12 months. Circulating VDPVs occur 
when routine or supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are poorly 
conducted and a population is left susceptible to poliovirus, whether 
from vaccine-derived or wild poliovirus. Hence, the problem is not with 
the vaccine itself, but low vaccination coverage. If a population is 
fully immunized, they will be protected against both vaccine-derived and
 wild polioviruses.Since 2000, more than 10 billion doses of OPV have been 
administered to nearly 3 billion children worldwide. As a result, more 
than 13 million cases of polio have been prevented, and the disease has 
been reduced by more than 99%. During that time, 24 cVDPV outbreaks 
occurred in 21 countries, resulting in fewer than 760 VDPV cases.Until 2015, over 90% of cVDPV cases were due to the type 2 
component in OPV. With the transmission of wild poliovirus type 2 
already successfully interrupted since 1999, in April 2016 a switch was 
implemented from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV in routine immunization 
programmes. The removal of the type 2 component of OPV is associated 
with significant public health benefits, including a reduction of the 
risk of cases of cVDPV2. The small risk of cVDPVs pales in significance to the 
tremendous public health benefits associated with OPV. Every year, 
hundreds of thousands of cases due to wild polio virus are prevented. 
Well over 10 million cases have been averted since large-scale 
administration of OPV began 20 years ago.Circulating VDPVs in the past have been rapidly stopped with 
2–3 rounds of high-quality immunization campaigns. The solution is the 
same for all polio outbreaks: immunize every child several times with 
the oral vaccine to stop polio transmission, regardless of the origin of
 the virus.Fact sheet on vaccine-derived poliovirus published by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (PDF)"
What is plague?,"Plague is an infectious disease found in some small mammals and 
their fleas. People can contract plague if they are in bitten by 
infected fleas, and develop the bubonic form of plague. Sometimes 
bubonic plague progresses to pneumonic plague, when the bacteria reaches
 the lungs. Person-to-person transmission is possible through the 
inhalation of infected respiratory droplets of a person who has 
pneumonic plague. Common antibiotics are efficient to cure plague, if 
they are delivered very early, because the course of the disease is 
usually rapid. Fact sheet on plague"
What are the types of plague and how do people become infected?,"There are two main forms of plague infection, depending on the
 route of infection: bubonic and pneumonic. All forms are treatable and 
curable if detected early enough. Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague globally
 and is caused by the bite of an infected flea. Plague bacillus, Y. 
pestis, enters at the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to 
the nearest lymph node where it replicates itself. The lymph node then 
becomes inflamed, tense and painful, and is called a ""bubo"". At advanced
 stages of infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores 
filled with puss. Human to human transmission of bubonic plague is rare.
 Bubonic plague can advance and spread to the lungs, which is the more 
severe type of plague called Pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague – or lung-based plague – is the most 
virulent form of plague. Incubation can be as short as 24 hours. Any 
person with pneumonic plague may transmit the disease via droplets to 
other humans. Untreated pneumonic plague, if not diagnosed and treated 
early, is fatal. However, recovery rates are high if detected and 
treated in time (within 24 hours of onset of symptoms)."
What are the symptoms of plague?,"Symptoms typically include sudden onset fever, chills, head and 
body aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea. Painful and inflamed lymph
 nodes can also appear during bubonic plague. Symptoms of the pneumonic 
form appear quickly after infection (sometimes less than 24 hours), and 
include severe respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath and 
coughing, often with blood-tainted sputum."
How does pneumonic differ from bubonic plague?,"Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague, but cannot be 
easily transmitted between people. Some people with bubonic plague will 
develop pneumonic plague, meaning the infection spreads to their lungs. 
Pneumonic plague can be transmitted between people through coughing. 
Bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30% to 60%, while the pneumonic 
form is fatal in the absence of treatment. Both types have good recovery
 rates if people are treated in time."
How can I protect myself from being infected with plague?,"To prevent the spread of pneumonic plague, avoid close contact 
(under 2 meters) with someone who is coughing, and reduce time spent in 
crowded areas. To prevent bubonic plague, do not touch dead animals and 
wear insect repellent while in plague endemic areas."
What should I do if I suspect I have plague?,"In case of sudden symptoms of fever, chills, painful and inflamed 
lymph nodes, or shortness of breath with coughing and/or blood-tainted 
expectoration, people should immediately contact a medical provider for 
an evaluation. (Travellers who have left plague-affected areas should 
inform their health worker of their travel history to a plague-affected 
area.) People should avoid self-medication, including using antibiotics,
 unless they are diagnosed by a health worker."
How do you diagnose plague?,"Health workers make an evaluation based on symptoms. Confirmation 
is based on laboratory testing  from a sample of blood, sputum (fluid 
coughed up from inside the lungs) or pus from a bubo."
How can plague be treated?,"Plague can be treated with antibiotics, and recovery is common if 
treatment starts early. In areas where there is a plague outbreak, 
people with symptoms should go to a health centre for evaluation and 
treatment.  Patients with pneumonic plague must be isolated and treated 
by trained medical staff wearing personal protective equipment."
"If I am in an area with an active plague outbreak, should I wear a mask to protect myself?","It depends on your level of exposure to sick people. People living
 in communities where there is a plague can wear masks if they wish, but
 masks must be used and disposed of properly so they do not become a 
source of infection themselves. Masks may help to reduce the spread of 
pneumonic plague if they are used correctly by people who are sick (to 
reduce the spread of droplets), and by health care workers (to protect 
themselves)."
Do dead bodies spread plague?,"The body of someone who has died after being infected with plague 
can infect people who are in close contact, such as those who are 
preparing the body for burial. The source of infection is the bacteria 
that are still present in body fluids."
What work is WHO doing for the prevention of attacks on health care?,"WHO has put considerable effort in documenting the problem to inform the global response to attacks on health care. The  Surveillance System for Attack on Health Care (SSA) is the primary tool collecting and sharing data about incidents of attacks in emergency countries. Through the SSA, WHO has established the first body of verified and reliable evidence, which can be used to generate analyses and reports to better understand attacks on health care. In addition, WHO advocates at the global and local levels to promote behaviour change. The global level strategy includes the organization of high-level events about attacks on health care, collaborations with partners involved in this field and social media campaigns. At the local level, WHO raises awareness about the importance of addressing attacks, distributes and shares information to support the response, negotiates for better access to health and collaborates with partners who have activities at the operational level.Finally, WHO has invested in the development of a body of research looking at the impact of attacks on health care and the documentation of good practices for prevention and protection measures. These aim to support health care providers in designing effective responses to attacks on health care."
What work is WHO doing to understand the consequences of attacks on health care?,"As the full extent of the impact of attacks on health care is not yet known, WHO is investing in researches on the different aspects of attacks as well as their short, mid and long term consequences. Through its research, WHO aims to provide more information about the impact of attacks on health care to the health of the affected populations as well as health service delivery, availability and accessibility."
How can attacks on health care be addressed?,"Addressing attacks on health care is a complex and challenging task. During emergencies, attacks come in so many shapes and forms that solutions to address them must be locally adapted in order to be effective. When addressing attacks on health care, it is important to keep in mind that incidents of attacks should not be viewed as isolated events, but as one piece of a larger problem. By conducting thorough context analyses, health care providers can adapt their protective measures to address the challenges posed by the local political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical contexts in which they operate. For this reason, WHO is conducting research on drivers of violence in various contexts and will provide a framework to conduct context analyses in emergency countries. Furthermore, WHO documents good practices undertaken by various actors to prevent attacks and mitigate their impact in emergency countries. Although each “practice”
    is dependent on the context in which they occur, there are aspects that can be generalized across operations to allow for better protection against attacks.  These resources will help to generate evidence-based recommendations for health actors, authorities, communities and other stakeholders to generate effective solutions to address attacks on health care at country-level."
What is 'One Health'?,"'One Health' is an approach to designing and implementing 
programmes, policies, legislation and research in which multiple sectors
 communicate and work together to achieve better public health outcomes.The areas of work in which a One Health approach is 
particularly relevant include food safety, the control of zoonoses 
(diseases that can spread between animals and humans, such as flu, 
rabies and Rift Valley Fever), and combatting antibiotic resistance 
(when bacteria change after being exposed to antibiotics and become more
 difficult to treat)."
Why do we need a One Health approach?,"Many of the same microbes infect animals and humans, as they 
share the eco-systems they live in. Efforts by just one sector cannot 
prevent or eliminate the problem. For instance, rabies in humans is 
effectively prevented only by targeting the animal source of the virus 
(for example, by vaccinating dogs).Information on influenza viruses circulating in animals is 
crucial to the selection of viruses for human vaccines for potential 
influenza pandemics. Drug-resistant microbes can be transmitted between 
animals and humans through direct contact between animals and humans or 
through contaminated food, so to effectively contain it, a 
well-coordinated approach in humans and in animals is required."
Who makes the One Health approach work?,"Many professionals with a range of expertise who are active in
 different sectors, such as public health, animal health, plant health 
and the environment, should join forces to support One Health 
approaches.To effectively detect, respond to, and prevent outbreaks of 
zoonoses and food safety problems, epidemiological data and laboratory 
information should be shared across sectors. Government officials, 
researchers and workers across sectors at the local, national, regional 
and global levels should implement joint responses to health threats.WHO works closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health
 (OIE) to promote multi-sectoral responses to food safety hazards, risks
 from zoonoses, and other public health threats at the 
human-animal-ecosystem interface and provide guidance on how to reduce 
these risks."
What is a healthy job?,"A healthy job is likely to be one where the pressures on employees are appropriate in relation to their abilities and resources, to the amount of control they have over their work and to the support they receive from people who matter to them. As health is not merely the absence of disease or infirmity but a positive state of complete physical, mental and social well-being (WHO, 1986), a healthy working environment is one in which there is not only an absence of harmful conditions but an abundance of health promoting ones.
These may include continuous assessment of risks to health, the provision of appropriate information and training on health issues and the availability of health promoting organizational support practices and structures. A healthy work environment is one in which staff have made health and health promotion a priority and part of their working lives."
What is work-related stress?,"Work-related stress is the response people may have when presented with work demands and pressures that are not matched to their knowledge and abilities and which challenge their ability to cope. Stress occurs in a wide range of work circumstances but is often made worse when employees feel they have little support from supervisors and colleagues, as well as little control over work processes. There is often confusion between pressure or challenge and stress, and sometimes this is used to excuse bad management practice.
Pressure at the workplace is unavoidable due to the demands of the contemporary work environment. Pressure perceived as acceptable by an individual may even keep workers alert, motivated, able to work and learn, depending on the available resources and personal characteristics. However, when that pressure becomes excessive or otherwise unmanageable it leads to stress. Stress can damage an employees' health and the business performance.
Work-related stress can be caused by poor work organization (the way we design jobs and work systems, and the way we manage them), by poor work design (for example, lack of control over work processes), poor management, unsatisfactory working conditions and lack of support from colleagues and supervisors.
Research findings show that the most stressful type of work is that which values excessive demands and pressures that are not matched to workers’ knowledge and abilities, where there is little opportunity to exercise any choice or control, and where there is little support from others.
Employees are less likely to experience work-related stress when demands and pressures of work are matched to their knowledge and abilities, control can be exercised over their work and the way they do it, support is received from supervisors and colleagues, and participation in decisions that concern their jobs is provided."
What are stress-related hazards at work?,"Stress related hazards at work can be divided into work content and work context.
Work contents includes job content (monotony, under-stimulation, meaningless of tasks, lack of variety, etc); work load and work pace (too much or too little to do, work under time pressure, etc.); working hours (strict or inflexible, long and unsocial, unpredictable, badly designed shift systems); and participation and control (lack of participation in decision-making, lack of control over work processes, pace, hours, methods, and the work environment).
Work context includes career development, status and pay (job insecurity, lack of promotion opportunities, under- or over-promotion, work of low social value, piece rate payment schemes, unclear or unfair performance evaluation systems, being over- or under-skilled for a job); the worker’s role in the organization (unclear role, conflicting roles); interpersonal relationships (inadequate, inconsiderate or unsupportive supervision, poor relationships with colleagues, bullying/harassment and violence, isolated or solitary work, etc.); organizational culture (poor communication, poor leadership, lack of behavioural rule, lack of clarity about organizational objectives, structures and strategies); and work-life balance (conflicting demands of work and home, lack of support for domestic problems at work, lack of support for work problems at home, lack of organizational rules and policies to support work-life balance)."
"What is the scientific evidence about risk factors, prevention and cost of workplace stress?","Work-related stress is still an evasive concept to many, although the topic is covered in hundreds of papers published every year. The seminar will focus on the main evidence of risk factors extracted from existing research, as concerns in particular work-related stress interventions and related costs. The presentation will provide an overview of the vast amount of knowledge we already have.

How do recognition and respect affect stress levels?,"Being respected and appreciated by significant others is one of the most fundamental human needs. Consequently, people go to great pain to gain acceptance and approval. Recent research in the domain of occupational health psychology shows that many stressful experiences are linked to being offended – for instance, by being offended or ridiculed, by social exclusion, by social conflict or by illegitimate tasks. Such experiences of being treated in an unfair manner constitute a so-called offence to self, and this may have far reaching consequences in terms of health and wellbeing. Conversely, being appreciated is one of the most important factors that increases motivation and satisfaction as well as health and wellbeing. The presentation below covers examples from recent research and draws conclusions concerning the many ways in which appreciation and respect (or lack thereof) can be communicated and how this knowledge can be useful for prevention in the field of health and well-being.

What are the health consequences of being overweight?,"The latest WHO projections indicate that at least one in three 
 of the world's adult population is overweight and almost one in 10 is 
obese. Additionally there are over 40 million children under age five 
who are overweight.
		Being overweight or obese can have a serious impact on health.
 Carrying extra fat leads to serious health consequences such as 
cardiovascular disease (mainly heart disease and stroke), type 2 
diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders like osteoarthritis, and some 
cancers (endometrial, breast and colon). These conditions cause 
premature death and substantial disability. What is not widely known is that the risk of health problems 
starts when someone is only very slightly overweight, and that the 
likelihood of problems increases as someone becomes more and more 
overweight. Many of these conditions cause long-term suffering for 
individuals and families. In addition, the costs for the health care 
system can be extremely high. The good news is that overweight and obesity are largely 
preventable. The key to success is to achieve an energy balance between 
calories consumed on one hand, and calories used on the other hand. To reach this goal, people can limit energy intake from total 
fats and shift fat consumption away from saturated fats to unsaturated 
fats; increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, as well as legumes, 
whole grains and nuts; and limit their intake of sugars. And to increase
 calories used,  people can boost  their levels of physical activity - 
to at least 30 minutes of regular, moderate-intensity activity on most 
days. Related linksDiet and physical activity: a public health priority"
What is trans fat?,"Trans fat, or trans-fatty acids, are unsaturated fatty acids that come from either natural or industrial sources. Naturally-occurring trans fat come from ruminants (cows and sheep). Industrially-produced trans fat are formed in an industrial process that adds hydrogen to vegetable oil converting the liquid into a solid, resulting in “partially hydrogenated” oil (PHO)."
What is the health impact of consuming foods that contain trans fat?,"Approximately 540,000 deaths each year can be attributed to intake of industrially produced trans-fatty acids.1 High trans fat intake increases the risk of death from any cause by 34%, coronary heart disease deaths by 28%, and coronary heart disease by
    21%.2 This is likely due to the effect on lipid levels: trans fat increases LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels while lowering HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels.2, 3 Trans fat has no known health benefits."
Is natural trans fat harmful as well?,"The effect on blood lipids resulting from changes in ruminant or industrially-produced trans fat appear to be similar.4 International expert groups and public health authorities recommend limiting consumption of trans fat (industrially-produced and ruminant) to less than 1% of total energy intake, which translates to less than 2.2 g/day for a 2,000-calorie diet."
Why are partially hydrogenated oils used in food?,Partially hydrogenated oils (PHO) are solid at room temperature and prolong the shelf life of products. They are primarily used for deep frying and as an ingredient in baked goods. PHOs were first introduced into the food supply in the early 20th century as a replacement for butter and lard; they are not a natural part of the human diet and are fully replaceable
Which foods contain industrially-produced trans fat?,"Partially hydrogenated oils (PHO) are the main source of industrially-produced trans fat. PHO is an ingredient in many foods, including margarine, vegetable shortening, and Vanaspati ghee; fried foods and doughnuts; baked goods such as crackers, biscuits, and pies; and pre-mixed products such as pancake and hot chocolate mix. Baked and fried street and restaurant foods often contain industrially-produced trans fat. All of these products can be made without industrially-produced trans fat."
How much trans fat do people consume?,"The average consumption of trans fat globally was estimated to be 1.4% of total energy in 2010, ranging from 0.2 to 6.5% of total energy across countries (0.13 to 4.3 grams per day for a 2,000-calorie diet).5 According to the available information, which is limited, the highest intake was in North America, Latin America and North Africa/Middle East, and intakes were generally higher at younger ages.5 Between 1990 and 2010, global trans fat intake is believed to have remained stable.5"
What is the best way to monitor industrially-produced trans fat?,"Monitoring the trans fat content in foods and the change over time is critical for establishing baseline levels of trans fat, measuring compliance with current regulations (if any), measuring the impact of regulations on the trans fat and saturated fatty acids (SFA) content of foods over time, and assessing the need for expanded regulations. Measuring population trans fat intake can help define the scope of the problem and evaluate the impact of regulations on trans fat consumption"
What is the best way to measure population trans fat intake?,"Assessing intake of trans fat should be done through population surveys. Potential methods include dietary surveys (food frequency questionnaires or 24 hour dietary recall) or blood plasma/serum assays. Dietary surveys require an up-to-date nutrition database that includes the trans fat content of food. Measuring trans fat intake through collection of blood serum/plasma, a relatively new method, doesn’t require detailed food supply data and can be used to track exposure to trans fat over time.6,7 It can also be used to validate changes seen in the food supply. Surveys may need to use purposive sampling to identify populations with the highest consumption of trans fat rather than simply determining average daily consumption."
What is the best way to measure the trans fat content of foods?,"Measuring the amount of trans fat in foods requires an understanding of the key sources of trans fat in the food supply. Products that represent the key sources of trans fat from all sectors (fats/oils, packaged foods, restaurant food, food in the informal sector) should be sampled, analyzed for trans fat contents, and recorded in a database. Where available, nutrition labels should also be reviewed for trans fat and saturated fatty acid (SFA) content and documented in the database.Monounsaturated fatty-acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty-acids (PUFA) should also be measured and recorded to understand what is replacing trans fat."
Is there a standard amount of trans fat in partially hydrogenated oils or does it vary widely across oils?,"The trans fat content of partially hydrogenated oils (PHO) can vary from 10-60% of the oil, depending on how the oil is manufactured, with an average trans fat content of 25-45% of the oil.8"
Does frying or heating oil create trans fat?,"There is evidence that heating and frying oil at high temperatures leads to modest increases in trans fat concentrations.9-14 On average, the level of trans fat has been found to increase by 3.67 g/100g after heating, and by 3.57 g/100g after frying.9 There is no evidence that other cooking methods, e.g. baking, boiling and grilling, lead to increased trans fat concentrations.15, 16"
Why not target heating and frying if it creates trans fat?,"The amount of trans fat generated during heating and frying is low when compared with the amount of trans fat in partially hydrogenated oils (PHO). On average, trans fat concentrations in PHOs are 25-45% of the oil,8  where heating and frying only increases trans fat concentrations by approximately 3%.9"
What healthy oils should be used instead?,"The removal of partially hydrogenated oils (PHO) results in substantial health benefits, with the greatest advantage obtained when PHOs are replaced by oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty- acids (PUFA), followed by oils rich in monounsaturated fatty-acids (MUFA).3 Oils rich in PUFAs include safflower oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil, fatty fish, walnuts, and seeds; oils rich in  MUFAs include canola oil, olive oil, peanut oil, and oils from nuts and avocados. The choices of fats and oils used in many countries will be influenced by availability, cost of the replacement alternatives and the oil industry’s capacity to innovate."
Why should governments prioritize eliminating trans fat from the food supply?,Replacing trans fat with healthier oils/fats in the food supply is a low-cost way for governments to save the lives of their citizens.  Experiences in several countries demonstrate that industrially-produced trans fat can be replaced by healthier oils.  Costs to implement best practice interventions (i.e. regulatory limits on trans fat) are likely well under the commonly accepted thresholds of cost-effectiveness.17 Modelling from the United Kingdom found five-year net savings in healthcare costs.18  WHO recommends trans fat elimination as a cost-effective intervention for low- and middle- income countries. Governments can eliminate the cause of 7% of cardiovascular disease globally with a low-cost investment.
What is REPLACE?,"REPLACE is an action package developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) that supports governments to ensure the prompt, complete, and sustained elimination of industrially-produced trans fat from the food supply. The practical, 6-step package calls for the promotion of use and consumption of healthier fats and oils, the elimination of industrially-produced trans fats, to be achieved through regulatory actions, while establishing solid monitoring systems and creating awareness among policy-makers, producers, suppliers, and the public."
Why support legislation/regulation rather than a voluntary approach?,"Experiences in several countries demonstrate that mandatory approaches are much more effective than voluntary approaches to reducing trans fat in the food supply and in the population.19 In New York City, voluntary efforts to reduce trans fat exposure by asking restaurants to use other products had no impact after a one-year intervention, and regulatory action to ban trans fat resulted in rapid and near-complete elimination.20 In six countries in south-eastern Europe with voluntary trans fat reduction, high concentrations of industrially-produced trans fat were still present in many different brands of biscuits, cakes and wafers after 2 years.21  Additionally, voluntary reformulation has led to reduced trans fat levels disproportionately across food categories. Some countries have had successes with voluntary measures leading to reductions in trans fat in the food supply, notably Canada, the Netherlands and the UK. 22, 23"
What countries have successfully eliminated trans fat?,"There are very few countries with high-quality data available on trans fat contents of the food supply. Denmark has been monitoring the trans fat contents in foods for the last 30 years, and virtual elimination of industrially-produced trans fat has been achieved.24 According to a recent review of trans fat intake globally, average national trans fat intake is below 1% of total energy (the international recommendation) in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Sweden, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom.25 However, it is unclear if significant proportions of the population still consume more than 1% of total energy from trans fat. There is a clear need for more countries to monitor trans fat in the food supply and population consumption."
What is the best practice for fully eliminating trans fat?,"Mandatory national limits on industrially-produced trans fat are the most effective way to reduce trans fat in the food supply.19 There are two primary models for mandatory limits. The first, pioneered in Denmark, limits industrially-produced trans fat to no more than 2 grams/100 grams of total fat/oils in all foods, and applies to domestic and imported products. The second model, recently adopted by the United States and Canada and going into effect in mid-2018, reclassifies PHO (the source of industrially-produced trans fat) as an unsafe food additive (US) or a contaminant or other adulterating substance in food (Canada26), essentially banning industrially-produced trans fat.Most countries that have passed regulations or legislation followed the Denmark model, including Austria, Chile, Ecuador, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Singapore, and South Africa. Latvia, Slovenia, and Sweden have passed similar limits that have not yet gone into effect. Argentina, Colombia, Iran and Switzerland have similar restrictions in effect, with 2% trans fat limits in fats and oils plus, in the case of Argentina and Colombia, 5% trans fat limits in fats and oils for other foods. India has limits of 5% trans fat content in some fats and oils."
What support is needed for industry to successfully eliminate industrially-produced trans fat?,"Regulatory measures should be accompanied by government support to industry, including education and technical assistance to support reformulation using polyunsaturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids instead of tropic oils and animal fats. In many cases, tropical vegetable oils high in saturated fatty acids (SFA) are the least expensive and most accessible alternative oils, so government technical support is particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises. Government support can include: subsidies, e.g. removing subsidies on PHOs and tropical oils high in SFA; introducing agricultural policies to reduce cost and increase availability of healthy oil alternatives; and funding for innovation research on healthy replacement oils. Argentina is a good example of government working with industry to increase the supply of healthy alternatives.22"
How does nutrition labelling support reducing trans fat intake?,"Including saturated fatty acid (SFA) and trans fat content on packaged food nutrition labels allows monitoring of compliance with mandatory trans fat limits and concomitant changes in SFA. Labelling provides a foundation for either voluntary programs to limit trans fat or local/national laws or regulation. Coupled with consumer education, media attention and advocacy, labelling can lead to reformulation, as in the United States. However, it is unlikely to lead to the full elimination of trans fat in the food supply.27 Almost 10 years after labelling was mandated in the United States and Canada, regulations are being put in place to ban partially hydrogenated oils from the food supply. While including trans fat levels on labels is important, health claims such as “trans fat free” should not be allowed unless other specific food criteria are met; single nutrient claims can be used to increase the market appeal of unhealthy foods high in sugar, salt or saturated fat. The effectiveness of labelling regulations may be limited in low- and middle- income countries, where the main source of trans fats is often food purchased from street vendors rather than packaged food.19"
Are trans fat policies enforceable?,"Yes, trans fat policies can be enforced. There is evidence to
support effective strategies, and lessons from experiences in
more challenging contexts can be applied to ensure successful
policy implementation and monitoring. Countries with large
informal food sectors may be challenging, as they are difficult to
regulate. However, by mandating that the oil and fats industry
limit (or ban) trans fat content, the oils and fats available on
the market can help drive change in product formulation in the
informal food sector. Additionally, a trans fat monitoring system
including random tests in the formal and informal sectors can be
established, with specific penalties. There are models for sampling
and measuring trans fat in foods in the informal food sector from
eastern European countries.28"
What can advocates do to support trans fat elimination?,"Advocates have a big role to play in trans fat elimination in order
to spur both governments and industry to take action. Knowledge
of trans fat exposure, either based on surveys or measuring trans
fat in foods, has been catalytic and very useful to advocates.
For example, in Argentina, the media disseminated scientific
and practical information to the public on the harmful effects
of trans fat, catalyzing change and creating demand, resulting
in replacement of approximately 40% of the trans fats that
were produced annually with other fats.22 In Denmark, a 1993
landmark study published in The Lancet along with subsequent
government reports on the impact of trans fat in Denmark initiated
years of media attention, which led to public awareness and
industry support. In Canada, scientific findings found that Canada
had one of the highest average levels of trans fat intake in the
world (8.4 grams per day in 1995), leading to public concern
and government response. In addition, as trans fat regulations
generally do not specify the types of oils for trans fat replacement,
the role of advocating for healthy replacement oils (i.e. oils low in
saturated fatty acids and high monounsaturated fatty acids and
polyunsaturated fatty acids) is particularly important."
What is the purpose of the PIP Framework?,"The Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP Framework) 
is helping Member States, laboratories, industry, and civil society work
 together to better prepare the world for an influenza pandemic.The PIP Framework was set up to introduce greater equity and 
solidarity among nations when the next pandemic strikes. The best 
defense against influenza is vaccination. However, many countries do not
 have the capacity to develop vaccines on their own, relying instead on 
products manufactured by others.  Moreover, with current technologies, 
producing a safe and efficacious vaccine requires at least 4–6 months 
from the time a virus emerges. Even then production will take time – 
therefore, each dose that will become available will be precious. Under the PIP Framework, WHO will have real-time access to 
approximately 10% of global vaccine production and will be able to send 
life-saving doses to developing countries in need.  In this manner, all 
countries – whether rich or poor – will have access to some vaccine at 
the same time."
How does the PIP Framework work?,"The PIP Framework has two goals that are pursued on an equal footing, promoting: the sharing of influenza viruses that could cause a pandemic, and access to capacity-development and products such as vaccines. Influenza viruses are shared through the Global Influenza 
Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a network of more than 150 
public health laboratories located around the world. In addition to 
serving as a virus sharing platform, GISRS also shares genetic sequence 
data derived from these viruses, develops and shares reagents, and 
undertakes risk assessments. One of its critical functions is to develop
 candidate vaccine viruses, which are used by manufacturers to develop 
vaccines against seasonal and pandemic influenza.In exchange for receiving influenza viruses with pandemic 
potential and associated data from GISRS, manufacturers contribute to 
pandemic preparedness in two ways: they pay an annual Partnership 
Contribution (totaling US$ 28 million) to WHO, and they agree, under 
legally binding contracts, to provide vaccines, antivirals, diagnostic 
kits or other products to WHO at the time of the next pandemic ."
How is the annual US $28 million Partnership Contribution spent?,"Partnership Contribution is split between preparedness funds, 
which are used to help countries prepare for a pandemic, and response 
funds, which are placed in a contingency fund that will be drawn upon in
 case of a pandemic. Currently 70% of funds are used for preparedness 
and 30% are allocated for response, as decided by the WHO Executive 
Board. Funds allocated for preparedness support five areas of work: laboratory and surveillance capacitiesburden of disease studiesregulatory capacitiesrisk communicationsplanning for deployment.Within these areas of work, priority countries were chosen on 
the basis of various criteria including existing capacity and funding. A
 new high-level implementation plan is being developed, in consultation 
with industry, civil society, and other partners, to determine future 
priority areas and countries.Partnership Contribution Implementation Portal"
What is the relationship between seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses?,"Seasonal and pandemic influenza are connected and both are 
shared within GISRS.  The PIP Framework only applies to influenza 
viruses that have the potential to cause a pandemic. A pandemic virus may develop from a mutated seasonal virus. 
The laboratory detection and analysis capacity required for seasonal 
viruses is the same as that required for detecting a potentially 
pandemic virus. Also, the capacity to produce a pandemic vaccine depends
 on robust seasonal vaccine production – in a pandemic, manufacturers 
will use the same seasonal vaccine production facilities to produce the 
pandemic vaccine."
Who oversees the implementation of the PIP Framework?,"An Advisory Group of 18 independent experts from all six WHO 
regions advises the Director-General on the implementation of the PIP 
Framework and interacts with industry, civil society, and other 
stakeholders. The Director-General promotes the PIP Framework’s 
implementation, while the World Health Assembly is ultimately 
responsible for oversight, direction, and coordination.What are the results of the 2016 review of the PIP Framework?
In 2016, the PIP Framework was reviewed for the first time, and progress
 in implementation was assessed. The key conclusion is that the PIP 
Framework is a “bold and innovative tool” for preparedness that has 
ensured “confidence and greater predictability” in the world’s ability 
to respond to an influenza pandemic. Review of the PIP Framework: Report by the Director-General
The review offers several recommendations to improve implementation, such as: to produce with urgency recommendations to clarify the handling of genetic sequence data;to undertake a study to determine the implications and desirability of including seasonal influenza viruses in the PIP Frameworkto develop a comprehensive evaluation model to allow for more regular and thorough assessment of progress."
What is the Decade of Action (DoA)?,"The UN Decade of Action on Nutrition, under the normative 
framework of ICN2 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, marks
 a new ambition and direction in global nutrition action: to eradicate 
hunger, end malnutrition in all its forms (undernutrition, micronutrient
 deficiencies, overweight or obesity) and reduce the burden of 
diet-related noncommunicable diseases in all age groups.The Decade will provide an umbrella for all relevant 
stakeholders voluntarily to consolidate and align nutrition actions 
across different sectors and facilitate policy processes across the 
areas identified in the ICN2 outcome documents.The Decade is an unprecedented opportunity for achieving 
nutrition impact at scale, with a collective vision of a healthier and 
more sustainable future.The vision of the Decade is of a world where all nutrition 
champions coordinate action and strengthen collaboration so that all 
people at all times and at all stages of life have access to affordable,
 diversified, safe and healthy diets.The Decade will work for a 10-year period within existing structures and available resources.

The UN Decade of Action on Nutrition is not an initiative; it is not a programme nor a project."
Why do we need a UN Decade of Action on Nutrition?,"Ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition is among the most 
urgent and pervasive development challenges. Most countries are burdened
 by more than one form of malnutrition or diet-related noncommunicable 
diseases. These forms may co-exist within the same country, community, 
household or individual.


Many families cannot afford enough nutrient rich foods, like 
fresh fruit and vegetables, legumes, meat and milk, while foods and 
drinks high in fat, sugar or salt are often cheap and readily available.The world is producing more than enough food to feed everyone.
 Yet one-third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted 
globally throughout the supply chain, from initial agricultural 
production to final individual food consumption.Prioritized and accelerated action-oriented efforts within the
 Decade will lead the world to meeting the World Health Assembly six 
global nutrition targets 2025 and the global diet-related 
noncommunicable diseases targets, and the many additional 
nutrition-relevant targets in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development."
Who is involved in the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition?,"The UN Decade of Action on Nutrition belongs to everyone and 
aims to involve all countries, regardless of their income, the nature of
 their malnutrition challenges and the characteristics of their food and
 health systems.
The Decade is a global collective effort driven by UN Members 
States and co-convened by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), in 
collaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP), the International 
Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) and the United Nations 
Children’s Fund (UNICEF).FAO and WHO, as co-convenors, will:promote policy dialogue at all levels;develop tools and instruments to support the implementation of programmes, policies, partnerships and investment; and
track and report on progress toward achieving global goals and country-specific commitments for action on nutrition.National governments and other relevant stakeholders, 
including international, intergovernmental and regional organizations, 
parliamentarians, civil society, academia and private sector all have an
 active role to play in the implementation of the Decade.In particular, the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) 
provides a vital multistakeholder platform where countries and their 
many partners can discuss progress, exchange lessons and experiences and
 agree on coherent and consistent food security and nutrition policies. 
The UN System Standing Committee on Nutrition (UNSCN) serves as a 
coordinating mechanism for the UN bodies and international organizations
 involved."
Are there specific events on the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition and/ or key opportunities to share and discuss progress towards ending all forms of malnutrition?,"FAO and WHO will work with the widest possible range of social
 actors and institutions, taking the opportunity to build upon and 
connect already planned events and to organize new bridge-building 
events to
promote the Decade and its aims. On 20 September 2016 the co-convenors 
launched a major consultation process to develop the work programme of 
the Decade.A series of consultations through coordination mechanisms such
 as UNSCN and multistakeholder platforms such as CFS, on-line forums and
 face-to-face meetings are being prepared to engage as many stakeholders
 as possible in the strategic process of developing the work programme. 
Participants will be invited to share views and ideas as well as receive
 feedback from countries and stakeholders on their expectations for the 
upcoming ten years.Many countries and other actors are already strongly committed
 to existing food and nutrition initiatives, mechanisms, alliances, 
movements or partnerships. These efforts will provide the structure for 
action. The umbrella of the Decade creates a framework for sharing 
experiences, promoting improved coordination by the participants 
themselves, and building political momentum for scaled up global action.
The Decade will facilitate North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation and learning."
How is the work programme for the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition being prepared and implemented?,"The work programme of the Decade will be a global programme but with action at the country level.
Setting out the work programme of the Decade will be an 
inclusive, continuous, and collaborative process, building upon and 
connecting the independent initiatives of governments and their many 
partners.Advocating for commitments by all stakeholders to implement 
specific interventions, policies, programmes and investments for action 
on nutrition in all relevant sectors will be crucial in order to bring 
about a real and meaningful system change to end all forms of 
malnutrition. The Decade will provide a standardized global framework 
for making, reporting and monitoring progress and for tracking results.All stakeholders are invited to submit inputs to the work 
programme of the Decade, taking as reference the six pillars identified 
in the ICN2 Framework for Action. These six pillars are:sustainable food systems for healthy diets;



aligned health systems providing universal coverage of essential nutrition actions;social protection and nutrition education;trade and investment for improved nutrition;
enabling food and breastfeeding environments; and
review, strengthen and promote nutrition governance and accountability.Stakeholders are encouraged to set, track and achieve 
specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (SMART) 
commitments. This will help all stakeholders understand what action is 
intended and
improve tracking.Three groups of catalytic mechanisms will support the progress
 on nutrition commitments across the Decade: evidence informed advocacy,
 convening platforms and accountability mechanisms."
How is the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition contributing to the achievement of Agenda 2030 and its Sustainable Development Goals?,"With the adoption of the Agenda 2030 and its Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) at the UN General Assembly in September 2015, 
world leaders committed to rid the world of the twin scourges of poverty
 and hunger and set out a vision for a fairer, more inclusive, 
prosperous, peaceful and sustainable world in which no one is left 
behind. SDG 2 in particular, aims to end hunger, achieve food security 
and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.The achievement of the 2030 SDGs will only be met when much 
greater political focus is given towards improving nutrition, as 
nutrition is both an input and outcome of sustainable development.The UN Decade of Action on Nutrition provides an opportunity 
for all partners to work together, mobilize action and accelerate fforts
 towards the elimination of hunger, food insecurity and all forms of 
malnutrition and meeting the SDGs by 2030."
What is pulmonary hypertension?,"Pulmonary hypertension is a condition in which there is high blood pressure in the lung arteries. How the disease starts is not always clear, but the arteries become narrow and there is less room for the blood to flow.
Over time, some of the arteries may stiffen and become completely blocked. The narrowing of the pulmonary arteries causes the right side of heart to work harder to pump blood through the lungs. Over time, the heart muscle weakens and loses its ability to pump enough blood for the body's needs. The extra stress causes the heart to enlarge and become less flexible. Heart failure is one of the most common causes of death in people who have pulmonary hypertension."
What are the causes?,"Pulmonary hypertension is often caused by existing chronic lung conditions. In some cases, pulmonary hypertension is caused by schistosomiasis, a worm infection which is common in Africa and Latin America; and sickle cell disease, a genetic abnormality of blood which is common in persons of African origin."
What are the symptoms,"Difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath is the main symptom of pulmonary hypertension. Other symptoms are fatigue, dizziness, swelling in the ankles or legs (edema), bluish lips and skin (cyanosis), chest pain, racing pulse and palpitations."
What is obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome?,"Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome is a clinical disorder marked by frequent pauses in breathing during sleep usually accompanied by loud snoring. These pauses cut off the oxygen supply to your body for a few seconds and halt the removal of carbon dioxide. As a result of this, your brain briefly wakes you up, re-opens the airways and re-starts breathing. This can occur many times during the night and makes proper sleep impossible. During the day you may experience excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty in concentrating or headaches. At night, snoring is the most common feature."
What is the diagnosis and how do you manage?,"Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome is diagnosed through polysomnography, a method of recording body activity during sleep; and pulse oximetry, which measures the amount of oxygen in the blood at any time. Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome is not a life-threatening condition in itself, but it can result in serious problems such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The disease can impact on the quality of life, but can be easily managed. One of the treatments is continuous positive airway pressure, which forces air through a mask into the airways so that they do not close."
What is raised blood pressure (hypertension)?,"Hypertension, also known as high or raised blood pressure, is a
 condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure,
 putting them under increased stress. Each time the heart beats; it 
pumps blood into the vessels, which carry the blood throughout the body.
 Blood pressure is created by the force of blood pushing against the 
walls of blood vessels (arteries) as it is pumped by the heart. The 
higher the pressure, the harder the heart has to pump.
		Normal adult blood pressure is defined as a blood pressure of 120 mm Hg1
 when the heart beats (systolic) and a blood pressure of 80 mm Hg when 
the heart relaxes (diastolic). When systolic blood pressure is equal to 
or above 140 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure equal to or above 
90 mm Hg the blood pressure is considered to be raised or high.Most people with hypertension have no symptoms at all; this is
 why it is known as the “silent killer”. Sometimes hypertension causes 
symptoms such as headache, shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain, 
palpitations of the heart and nose bleeds, but not always."
Why is raised blood pressure dangerous?,"The higher the blood pressure, the higher the risk of damage to
 the heart and blood vessels in major organs such as the brain and 
kidneys. Hypertension is the most important preventable cause of heart 
disease and stroke worldwide.
		If left uncontrolled, hypertension can lead to a heart attack,
 an enlargement of the heart and eventually heart failure. Blood vessels
 may develop bulges (aneurysms) and weak spots that make them more 
likely to clog and burst. The pressure in the blood vessels can cause 
blood to leak out into the brain and cause a stroke. Hypertension can 
also lead to kidney failure, blindness, and cognitive impairment. The health consequences of hypertension can be compounded by 
other factors that increase the odds of heart attack, stroke and kidney 
failure. These factors include tobacco use, unhealthy diet, harmful use 
of alcohol, lack of physical activity, and exposure to persistent stress
 as well as obesity, high cholesterol and diabetes mellitus."
How can raised blood pressure be prevented and treated?,"All adults should have their blood pressure checked. routinely,
 it is important to know your numbers. If blood pressure is high, they 
need the advice of a health worker.
		For some people, lifestyle changes such as stopping tobacco 
use, eating healthily, exercising regularly and avoiding the harmful use
 of alcohol, are sufficient to control blood pressure. Reduction in salt
 intake can also help. For others, these changes are insufficient and 
they need prescription medication to control blood pressure.Adults can support treatment by adhering to the prescribed medication, lifestyle changes and by monitoring their health.People with high blood pressure that also have high blood 
sugar, elevated blood cholesterol or kidney damage face even higher risk
 of heart attacks and stroke. Therefore it is important that regular 
checks for blood sugar, blood cholesterol and urine albumin take place.Everyone can take five concrete steps to minimize the odds of developing high blood pressure and its adverse consequences. Healthy diet:promoting a healthy lifestyle with emphasis on proper nutrition for infants and young people;reducing salt intake to less than 5 g of salt per day (just under a teaspoon);eating five servings of fruit and vegetables a day;reducing saturated and total fat intake.Avoiding harmful use of alcohol i.e.  limit intake to no more than one standard drink a dayPhysical activity:regular physical activity and promotion of physical activity for children and young people (at least 30 minutes a day). maintaining a normal weight: every 5 kg of excess weight lost can reduce systolic blood pressure by 2 to 10 points.Stopping tobacco use and exposure to tobacco productsManaging stress in healthy way such as through meditation, appropriate physical exercise, and positive social contact."
How common is raised blood pressure?,"More than 1 in 5 adults worldwide have raised blood pressure – a
 condition that causes around half of all deaths from stroke and heart 
disease. Complications from hypertension account for 9.4 million deaths 
worldwide every year.
		In nearly all high-income countries, widespread diagnosis and 
treatment with low-cost medication have led to a significant drop in the
 proportion of people with raised blood pressure, as well as the average
 blood pressure across populations – and this has contributed to a 
reduction in deaths from heart disease. For example, the prevalence of 
raised blood pressure in the WHO region of the Americas in 2014 was 18%,
 as compared to 31% in 1980.In contrast, low-income countries have the highest prevalence 
of raised blood pressure. In the WHO African region, more than 30% of 
adults in many countries are estimated to have high blood pressure and 
this proportion is increasing. Furthermore, the average blood pressure 
levels in this region are much higher than global averages.Many people with high blood pressure in developing countries 
are not aware of their disease, and do not have access to treatments 
that could control their blood pressure and significantly reduce their 
risk of death and disability from heart disease and stroke. Detection, 
treatment and control of hypertension is an important health priority 
worldwide."
What is overweight and obesity?,"Overweight and obesity are defined as ''abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health''. 
Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. The problem is global and is steadily affecting many low- and middle-income countries, particularly in urban settings. The prevalence has increased at an alarming rate. Globally in 2016, the number of overweight children under the age of five, is estimated to have been over 41 million. Almost half of all overweight children under 5 lived in Asia and one quarter lived in Africa. Overweight and obese children are likely to stay obese into adulthood and more likely to develop noncommunicable diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age. Overweight and obesity, as well as their related diseases, are largely preventable. Prevention of childhood obesity therefore needs high priority."
How are overweight and obesity measured in children?,"The most commonly used measure for overweight and obesity is the Body Mass Index (BMI) - a simple index to classify overweight and obesity in adults. It is defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kg/m2). 
The BMI provides the most useful population-level measure of overweight and obesity, as it is the same for both sexes and for all ages of adults. However, it should be considered as a rough guide because it may not correspond to the same body fat percentage in different individuals. 
It is difficult to develop one simple index for the measurement of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents because their bodies undergo a number of physiological changes as they grow. Depending on the age, different methods to measure a body's healthy weight are available: 
For children aged 0-5 years
The WHO Child Growth Standards, launched in April 2006, include measures for overweight and obesity for infants and young children up to age 5.

The WHO Child Growth Standards 


WHO Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition, 0-5 years. 


For individuals aged 5-19 years
WHO developed the Growth Reference Data for 5–19 years. It is a reconstruction of the 1977 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO reference and uses the original NCHS data set supplemented with data from the WHO child growth standards sample for young children up to age 5. 

Growth reference data for 5-19 years

Why does childhood overweight and obesity matter?,"Childhood obesity is associated with a higher chance of premature death and disability in adulthood. Overweight and obese children are more likely to stay obese into adulthood and to develop noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age. For most NCDs resulting from obesity, the risks depend partly on the age of onset and on the duration of obesity. Obese children and adolescents suffer from both short-term and long-term health consequences. 
The most significant health consequences of childhood overweight and obesity, which often do not become apparent until adulthood, include:

cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart disease and stroke);
diabetes;
musculoskeletal disorders, especially osteoarthritis; and
certain types of cancer (endometrial, breast and colon).

At least 2.6 million people each year die as a result of being overweight or obese."
What is the double burden of malnutrition?,"Many low- and middle-income countries are now facing the so-called double burden of disease. As they continue to struggle with the problems of infectious diseases and under-nutrition, at the same time they are experiencing a rapid increase in risk factors of NCDs such as obesity and overweight, particularly in urban settings. 
It is not uncommon to find under-nutrition and obesity existing side by side within the same country, the same community or even within the same household in these settings. 
This double burden is caused by inadequate prenatal, infant and child nutrition, which is then followed by exposure to high fat, energy dense, micronutrient poor foods and a lack of physical activity as the child grows older."
What are the causes of childhood overweight and obesity?,"The fundamental cause of childhood overweight and obesity is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended. 
Global increases in childhood overweight and obesity are attributable to several factors. First, there has been a global shift in diet towards increased intake of energy-dense foods that are high in fat and sugars but low in vitamins, minerals and other healthy micronutrients. There is also a trend towards decreased physical activity levels due to the increasingly sedentary nature of many forms of recreation time, changing modes of transportation and increasing urbanization. 
WHO recognizes that the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity results from changes in society. Childhood obesity is mainly associated with unhealthy eating and low levels of physical activity, but the problem is linked not only to children's behaviour but also, increasingly, to social and economic development and policies in the areas of agriculture, transport, urban planning, the environment, food processing, distribution and marketing, as well as education.
The problem is societal and therefore it demands a population-based multisectoral, multidisciplinary and culturally relevant approach.
Unlike most adults, children and adolescents cannot choose the environment in which they live or the food they eat. They also have a limited ability to understand the long-term consequences of their behaviour. They therefore require special attention when fighting the obesity epidemic."
What can be done to fight the childhood obesity epidemic?,"Overweight and obesity, as well as related noncommunicable diseases, are largely preventable. It is recognized that prevention is the most feasible option for curbing the childhood obesity epidemic since current treatment practices are largely aimed at bringing the problem under control rather than effecting a cure. The goal in fighting the childhood obesity epidemic is to achieve an energy balance which can be maintained throughout the individual's life span. 
WHO recommends the following to reduce and prevent childhood overweight and obesity:

increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, as well as legumes, whole grains and nuts;
limit energy intake from total fats and shift fat consumption away from saturated fats to unsaturated fats; 
limit the intake of sugars; and 
be physically active and accumulate at least 60 minutes of regular, moderate- to vigorous-intensity activity each day that is developmentally appropriate."
What needs to be done at the societal level?,"Curbing the childhood obesity epidemic requires sustained political commitment and the collaboration of many public and private stakeholders. 
Governments, international partners, civil society, NGOs and the private sector have vital roles to play in shaping healthy environments and making healthier diet options for children and adolescents affordable, and easily accessible. It is therefore WHO's objective to mobilize these partners and engage them in implementing the Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health. 
WHO supports the designation, implementation, monitoring and leadership of actions. A multisectoral approach is essential for sustained progress; the Organization mobilizes the combined energy, resources and expertise of all global stakeholders involved."
What is allergic rhinitis?,"Allergic rhinitis, or hay fever, happens when you breathe in something to which you are allergic, and the inside of your nose becomes inflamed and swollen.Sinusitis is an inflammation of the lining inside the sinuses which can be acute or chronic. When the sinuses become blocked and fill with fluid, germs can grow and cause symptoms such as headache and nasal yellowish secretions. Blocked sinuses can be caused by the common cold, hay fever or nasal polyps (small lumps inside the nose). Allergic rhinitis and sinusitis are linked to each other, because allergic rhinitis causes your nose to become blocked, and in turn blocks the sinuses."
What are the causes?,"Allergic rhinitis is triggered by allergens. Allergens can be found both outdoors and indoors. When allergic rhinitis is caused by outdoor allergens, e.g., mould or trees, grass and weed pollens — it is often referred to as seasonal allergies, or “hay fever”. Allergic rhinitis may also be triggered by allergens found in the home, such as animal dander, indoor mould, or house dust mites. The most current classification of allergic rhinitis, tough, takes into consideration the intensity of symptoms and the impact on quality of life. According to these characteristics it may be mild or moderate/severe."
Is there any treatment?,"Acute sinusitis usually subsides without any need for specific treatment. Chronic sinusitis may require antibiotics, decongestants or steroid nasal sprays."
What does “preterm” mean?,"Preterm refers to a baby born before 37 weeks of pregnancy have been completed. Normally, a pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks."
How many babies are born preterm every year and where?,"Preterm birth is a global problem. It occurs in high, low, and middle-income countries. About 15 million babies are born preterm each year; that is more than 1 in 10 babies worldwide. 60% of them are born in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia."
How do preterm births occur?,"Most preterm births happen spontaneously, but some are due to early induction of labour or caesarean birth, whether for medical or non-medical reasons."
Is there a way to tell if you are at risk of having a preterm baby?,"There is no test that can accurately predict who might have a preterm birth. We do not fully understand the causes of preterm births.There are several factors that may put a pregnant woman at higher risk of a preterm birth, including a previous preterm birth, multiple pregnancies such as twins, triplets, etc, some chronic medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes and infections. Pregnancy in adolescence is a major risk factor for preterm birth."
Can a pregnant woman’s lifestyle put her at risk of a preterm birth?,"Women who smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol or take other recreational drugs are at a higher risk of having preterm babies. Stress from any cause is also known to increase a woman’s risk of having preterm birth."
How many preterm babies could be saved?,"Around 1 million preterm babies die each year. Those babies who survive can face lifelong physical, neurological or learning disabilities, often at great cost to families and society.An estimated three-quarters of these preterm babies could survive if they had access to proven and often inexpensive care – like warmth, breastfeeding support, and basic care for infections and breathing difficulties.Though preterm births occur in high-income countries, access to these proven interventions means that almost 9 out of every 10 preterm babies survive in those settings in sharp contrast to about 1 out of 10 in low-income countries."
Why do preterm babies need special care?,"Preterm babies are not fully prepared to live in the world outside their mother’s womb. They get cold more easily and may need more help feeding than full-term babies. Because their bodies are not yet fully developed, they may have problems breathing and can also suffer from other complications including infections."
Q: What health challenges do preterm babies face?,"The earlier in a pregnancy that babies are born, the less prepared their bodies are for the outside world. They need special care to overcome the following challenges:Staying warm: Preterm babies lose body heat more easily, putting them at risk of life-threatening hypothermia. They need extra energy and care to stay warm and grow.Feeding: Preterm babies can have trouble feeding because the coordinated suck and swallow reflex is not yet fully developed. They may need additional support for feeding.Breathing: Many preterm babies start breathing on their own when they are born, but others need to be resuscitated. If the lungs are not fully developed and lack surfactant (a substance that helps keep the lungs expanded), preterm babies may have difficulty breathing. Sometimes, premature babies that start off breathing are not strong enough to continue on their own. They exhaust themselves and may stop breathing (apnoea).Infections: Severe infections are more common among preterm babies. Their immune systems are not yet fully developed, and they have a higher risk of dying if they get an infection.Brain: Preterm babies are at risk of bleeding in the brain, during birth and in the first few days after birth; about 1 in 5 babies weighing less than 2kg have this problem. Preterm babies can also have brain injuries from a lack of oxygen. Bleeding or lack of oxygen to the brain can result in result in cerebral palsy, developmental delays and learning difficulties.Eyes: Preterm babies’ eyes are not ready for the outside world. They can be damaged by abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina. The condition is usually more severe in very premature babies and if they are given too-high a level of oxygen. This can result in visual impairment or blindness."
Q: What are the consequences of preterm birth later in life?,"Preterm babies are at risk of developing disabilities that will affect them for their entire lives. The extent to which this will affect their life strongly depends on how early they were born, the quality of care they received during and around birth and the days and weeks that follow."
Q: What kind of care do preterm babies need?,"Babies who are born preterm need the same care that other babies get and a little more. This includes:Good pregnancy care:All pregnant women should receive good care, including at least four antenatal visits with a health worker.Mothers at risk of preterm birth (e.g. those who have had a preterm birth before) need to be aware that it may happen again, and plan accordingly.Health workers caring for pregnant women need to assess their risk of delivering preterm and be able to recognize and manage conditions that can lead to preterm birth (e.g. pre-eclampsia, a condition in pregnancy that causes the mother to have high blood pressure).Women in preterm labour should give birth at a health facility where they and their babies can get the care they need. They may need to be referred to a hospital where more advanced care is available, and the safest time to do this is when the baby is still in the womb.Delivery by caesarean section or early induction of labour that is not medically necessary should be avoided.Women in preterm labour, before 34 weeks of pregnancy have been completed, should receive steroid injections to speed up the development of the baby’s lungs.Essential newborn care:All babies need to be protected from infections: everyone who touches the mother or the baby should have clean hands. Medical examinations and procedures should only be done if necessary. Sterile gloves and cutting devices should be used for clamping and cutting the umbilical cord.All babies need to be kept warm: right after birth, they should be dried thoroughly and placed on their mother’s abdomen. If they breathe normally, and after the umbilical cord has been clamped and cut, they should be put on their mother’s chest, with skin-to-skin contact, until after the first breastfeed. They should not be bathed right away.Most babies will breathe normally after thorough drying. Those who do not start breathing on their own need help: ventilation with a bag and mask will usually put them back on track.Breast is best: just like full-term babies, breast milk is the best nutrition for preterm babies. Babies should be breastfed as soon as possible after birth. Most premature babies who are unable to coordinate the suck and swallow reflex can be fed their mother’s expressed breast milk by cup, spoon or nasogastric tube.Extra care for small babies:Preterm babies, and full-term babies with low birth weight need extra warmth and support for feeding.Kangaroo Mother Care is a good way of doing this.Care for preterm babies with complications:Babies who have infections need treatment with antibiotics.Babies who do not breathe when they are born need basic newborn resuscitation; if breathing problems persist, they may need additional support from a machine (ventilator) and extra oxygen.Babies who have additional complications may need to be kept in neonatal intensive care, where that is available."
Q: What is Kangaroo Mother Care?,"Kangaroo Mother Care is a technique by which the baby is held on an adult’s chest—usually the mother—with skin-to-skin contact, for extended periods of time. It is suitable for preterm and full-term babies weighing less than 2kg who do not have other serious problems (breathing well, normal heart rate). The baby is placed on his/her mother’s chest and stays there, day and night, held in place by a cloth that is wrapped and tied at the mother’s back. Kangaroo Mother Care could save an estimated 450 000 preterm newborns a year.Kangaroo Mother Care is an effective way to meet a premature baby’s needs for warmth, frequent breastfeeding, protection from infection, stimulation, safety and love. It has also been shown to improve bonding between mothers and babies."
Q: What is neonatal intensive care?,"Hospitals with neonatal intensive care units can provide specialized care for newborn babies with serious health problems. They have special equipment and specially trained doctors and nurses who provide around-the-clock care for preterm babies who need extra support to keep warm, to breathe and to be fed, or who are very sick."
Which types of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) does WHO consider to be ‘new types’?,"Until a few years ago, all WHO-recommended ITNs contained only pyrethroid insecticide as the active ingredient (AI). These nets were assessed for physical and chemical durability over an anticipated lifespan of 3 years and 20 washes based on WHO standard washing procedures; they are referred to as pyrethroid-only long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). Pyrethroid-only LLINs are the current standard of care across most malaria-endemic countries. All other nets are considered ‘new types’ (see Table 1 under Q&A References). In 2009, the first new type of ITN – PermaNet® 3.0 – received an interim recommendation from the former WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES). The net contains a pyrethroid insecticide and the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO). The addition of PBO is intended to enhance the killing effect of pyrethroids, particularly in mosquito populations that exhibit metabolic resistance. The public health value of a pyrethroid-PBO net was first demonstrated by Olyset® Plus leading to a conditional policy recommendation that encompasses all WHO prequalified pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Further studies on the public health value of this and other pyrethroid-PBO nets are underway, with the aim of generating additional evidence to support a full WHO policy recommendation (See question “Are new types of ITNs more expensive than pyrethroid-only LLINs?”). To date, five pyrethroid-PBO products have been prequalified by WHO (Olyset® Plus, PermaNet® 3.0, Veeralin®, Tsara® Boost, and Tsara® Plus).In recent years, other types of new nets treated with 2 AIs have been developed. Interceptor® G2 is a dual AI net treated with the pyrethroid alpha-cypermethrin and the pyrrole insecticide chlorfenapyr; it was prequalified by WHO in January 2018. In March 2019, Royal Guard®, a dual AI net containing the pyrethroid alpha-cypermethrin and the insect growth regulator pyriproxyfen, was added to the list of WHO-prequalified vector control products based on an assessment of a complete product dossier. The listing of both Interceptor® G2 and Royal Guard® in the absence of a specific WHO policy recommendation was an exception made during the transition from WHOPES to the new WHO evaluation process for vector control interventions."
Why do WHO guidelines use both the terms long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs)?,"With the arrival of new types of nets, the term ITN was re-introduced by the Global Malaria Programme as the umbrella term for all nets treated with an insecticide, insect-growth regulator and/or synergist. The term LLIN is only being used for ITN classes for which physical and chemical durability have been comprehensively demonstrated against the WHO thresholds of 20 washes and 3 years of use in the field. In practice, this means that only nets treated with a pyrethroid insecticide alone are presently referred to as LLINs in the WHO  Guidelines for malaria vector control and companion documents."
How do these new types of ITNs differ from the traditional pyrethroid-only LLINs?,"Pyrethroid-PBO ITNs differ from pyrethoid-only LLINs in that they contain the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO). PBO, by inhibiting certain metabolic enzymes (e.g. mixed-function oxidases, or MFOs), is intended to enhance the killing of the pyrethroid-resistant mosquito population.Pyrethroid-PBO nets kill susceptible mosquitoes in the same way as pyrethroid-only LLINs, while also overcoming individual pyrethroid resistance. This enhanced action can be expected to diminish over time due to ongoing selection pressure on the mosquito population. In the meantime, these types of nets are a useful intervention to deploy in areas of pyrethroid resistance.The dual active ingredient (AI) nets prequalified by WHO, namely Interceptor® G2 and Royal Guard®, contain pyrethroids and additional chemicals that kill or sterilize mosquitoes in ways that are different from pyrethroids. Both nets are intended to perform better than pyrethroid-only LLINs by killing mosquitoes that carry pyrethroid resistance genes, provided these mosquitoes are susceptible to pyrrole insecticides or to pyriproxyfen. Field studies demonstrating improved impact in reducing or preventing Plasmodium infection and/or malaria disease in humans in areas of pyrethroid resistance are presently not available for these 2 products, nor are there conclusive data on the susceptibility of the local mosquito populations in malaria endemic areas to chlorfenapyr or pyriproxyfen."
Are new types of ITNs more effective than pyrethroid-only LLINs?,"According to available entomological evidence, new types of nets may be more effective at killing or controlling pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes. Currently, WHO evaluation criteria guide the assessments of the entomological efficacy of ITNs against relevant mosquito strains.The WHO prequalification team for vector control sets the baseline for quality, safety, and efficacy of all products that are prequalified. WHO considers that all types of prequalified new nets will perform at least as well as pyrethroid-only nets prior to field use and degradation due to washing and other wear and tear. WHO is, however, presently not in a position to provide guidance on these products’ potentially superior entomological performance or their chemical and physical durability in the field.With respect to improved malaria control, this has only been demonstrated, to date, for one pyrethroid-PBO net – Olyset® Plus – in one  cluster randomized trial conducted in Tanzania. A second study to demonstrate impact in controlling malaria, deploying two pyrethroid-PBO products – Olyset® Plus and PermaNet® 3.0 – is currently underway in Uganda; results will likely be made available for WHO review in 2020. For Interceptor® G2 and Royal Guard®, trials designed to measure epidemiological impact began in 2019, but data to inform potential WHO policy recommendations will not be available until 2022. A trial with Olyset Duo®, a product similar to Royal Guard®, recently ended in Burkina Faso and showed modestly improved malaria control compared to pyrethroid-only nets.In summary, current evidence indicates that pyrethroid-PBO nets are likely to provide better malaria control than pyrethroid-only LLINs in areas of pyrethroid resistance. The extent to which this effect can be achieved by all pyrethroid-PBO nets is unclear, as no comparative performance data for the different products are available. For Interceptor® G2 and Royal Guard®, it is presently unknown whether their deployment will translate into better impact against malaria than that achieved by pyrethroid-only LLINs, or how their impact compares to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. However, these dual AI nets do provide a new mode of action, which is desirable for pyrethroid resistance management (see question ""When should a country consider purchasing a new type of ITN?"")."
Are all pyrethroid-PBO nets the same?,"No. The products may differ in terms of their chemical and physical specifications (see Table 1 under Q&A References for overview), regeneration times, and wash resistance. Also, there are key differences in product design with respect to the location of the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) on the net (i.e. all net panels or just the top panel); the PBO loading dose (concentration); and the specific pyrethroid (e.g., alphacypermethrin, deltamethrin, and its concentration). It is unknown whether or how these differences translate into potentially different entomological efficacy over time, or epidemiological impact. A study design to test similar performance of products side-by-side – known as a ‘non-inferiority’ study – is being conducted to investigate whether this method may provide a pragmatic approach to investigate these potential differences, and to provide assurance that a policy recommendation based on epidemiological data for one product is applicable to similar products that are considered to be part of the same intervention class. Non-inferiority data on currently WHO prequalified pyrethroid-PBO nets will be available by the end of 2020."
Are new types of ITNs more expensive than pyrethroid-only LLINs?,"All new types of ITNs currently cost more than a pyrethroid-only LLIN. Specific costs will depend on the size of the net, quantities purchased, lead times and other variables."
"In the context of new types of ITNs, what is the difference between a net being prequalified by WHO and a net having an associated specific WHO policy recommendation?","The WHO prequalification process assesses vector control products for their safety, quality and entomological efficacy against published evaluation standards. Currently prequalified new types of ITNs have demonstrated that they are safe and effective for their intended use. Questions on long-term durability remain, particularly with regards to the wash-resistance of the  synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and of chlorfenapyr and pyriproxyfen. The WHO prequalification team for vector control have initiated a review of these products to address these questions.WHO policy recommendations, in turn, are developed based on the WHO guideline development  process, which requires evidence on the impact of an intervention in reducing the targeted disease(s). Given that ITNs with active ingredients other than pyrethroids have been designed to provide improved disease control in areas where malaria vectors have become insecticide resistant, the development of a policy recommendation for these new products requires demonstration of their public health value by means of at least two trials with epidemiological endpoints. In 2017, WHO granted – on an exceptional basis – a conditional policy recommendation for pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. The recommendation was developed based on  findings from one trial in Tanzania and will remain conditional until data from at least one more trial conducted over 2 years have confirmed the enhanced impact on malaria that was demonstrated in the first study."
Interceptor® G2 and Royal Guard® are not covered by a specific WHO policy recommendation – what does this mean in practice?,"Interceptor® G2 and Royal Guard® were added, on an exceptional basis, to the list of WHO-prequalified vector control products during the WHO transition from the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme to the new WHO evaluation process for vector control
    interventions. While both nets meet WHO standards for safety, there are no available epidemiological data to indicate whether Interceptor® G2 and Royal Guard® would control malaria better than a pyrethroid-only LLIN. For lack of a better alternative, both products are considered as covered by
    the WHO policy recommendation for pyrethroid-only nets. As soon as data on the epidemiological impact of these two products have been generated and reviewed by WHO’s Vector Control Advisory Group (VCAG), WHO will formulate specific policy recommendations.Meanwhile, WHO recognizes that some Member States may be interested in deploying new types of ITNs not covered by specific policy recommendations. Guidance for such countries is included in the question ""When should a country consider purchasing a new type of ITN?"""
When should a country consider purchasing a new type of ITN?,"WHO released conditional recommendations on deployment of pyrethroid-PBO nets in 2017, including guidance on the characteristics of settings
    most likely to benefit from deployment of pyrethroid-PBO nets. Over the last 2 years, WHO has worked with partners in translating these recommendations into the practical deployment of pyrethroid-PBO nets. This experience has shown that data on specific contextual characteristics – particularly data on involvement of monooxygenases – are often not available at county or province level and that countries are forced to extrapolate from existing
    data points. To support pragmatic decision-making, WHO has developed a simplified overview of areas where deployment of pyrethroid-PBO nets may be most beneficial, based on current available evidence (See figure 10.2 of the World malaria report 2019). Given
 the resource constraints of national malaria programmes and supply constraints for pyrethroid-PBO nets, further prioritization will be required to target any pyrethroid-PBO nets within the country. WHO recommends that within eligible areas, those
    with the highest malaria burden are prioritized.For other types of new ITNs, no deployment guidance has been developed as this would normally accompany a WHO policy recommendation. WHO recognizes that some Member States may be interested in deploying new types of ITNs not covered by specific policy
    recommendations, for example to start generating local cost-effectiveness evidence to inform national prioritization processes or as part of an insecticide resistance management strategy.In the absence of such a WHO policy recommendation and associated deployment guidance, WHO Member States that wish to deploy Interceptor® G2 or Royal Guard® are advised in the meantime to ensure any deployment supports building the local
    evidence base, with the ultimate aim of generating cost-effectiveness estimates to inform national prioritization processes. Consideration should be given to the ability of the health system and/or national research partners to generate data on the
    effectiveness of the chosen products in the local context. Areas targeted should be those where pyrethroid resistance in the main malaria vector(s) has been confirmed using WHO Test procedures for insecticide resistance monitoring. In principle, the targeting of high(er) endemicity areas should be considered, with a view to achieving maximum impact. Consideration should also be given to the need to sustain access to these or similar tools if additional epidemiological impact
    is demonstrated in the ongoing trials.WHO recommends that WHO Member States considering deploying Interceptor® G2 or Royal Guard® do so only as part of a wider decision-making exercise on the most effective use of available malaria control funding. WHO further advises that any such
    deployment should not come at the expense of reducing existing ITN coverage."
Is there a specific threshold at which pyrethroid-only LLINs fail to work? Is there a specific pyrethroid-resistance threshold at which a switch to a new type of ITN is recommended by WHO?,"There is no specific resistance threshold at which pyrethroid-only LLINs are considered to fail or at which these nets should be withdrawn from targeted areas. A WHO-coordinated multi-country study comparing net users with non-users living in areas where the main malaria vectors had developed pyrethroid resistance has shown that, irrespective of pyrethroid resistance, users of nets were significantly better protected from malaria than non-users.
    WHO recommends that, irrespective of pyrethroid resistance, populations in malaria-endemic areas should continue to use pyrethroid-only LLINs to reduce their risk of infection. Nevertheless, the multi-country study indicated that pyrethroid-only LLINs
    provide only partial protection against malaria. To achieve the targets set out in the Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030,
 WHO recognizes that the integration of new interventions, including new types of nets, will be essential. Such integration should be informed by evidence of the public health value of the new interventions.Guidance on the selection of malaria vector control interventions based on insecticide resistance data is provided in section 3.1 of the 
Guidelines for malaria vector control
. For pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, this guidance is consistent with that provided earlier in this Q&A document and in the corresponding  policy recommendation. Interceptor®
 G2 and Royal Guard® are currently not included in this guidance due to the absence of a specific WHO policy recommendation; guidance for countries considering deploying these products in the meantime is provided under the question ""When should a country consider purchasing a new type of ITN?"""
What is the scale-back strategy in the event that new types of ITNs not currently covered by WHO policy recommendations fail to demonstrate public health value?,"In the event that public health value cannot be demonstrated by Interceptor® G2 or Royal Guard®, no WHO policy recommendation will be issued, and therefore, the current WHO prequalification listing of these two products would be reviewed. WHO Member States that chose to deploy these new types of ITNs would then be able to phase them out during the next mass distribution campaign and through their routine systems.  With new types of ITNs being at least as effective as pyrethroid-only LLINs, no harm will have been done."
What messages should the national malaria control programme communicate with respect to new types of ITNs to communities and authorities in malaria-endemic areas?,"It is recommended that communication on new types of ITNs be informed by currently available evidence on their likely impact, rather than by assumptions. Managing expectations at this time – where evidence of public health value of new types of ITNs is scarce – is crucial. A framework to inform the development of a communications strategy, as developed by the Alliance for Malaria Prevention, is provided at the following link."
What is the Unitaid/Global Fund ‘New Nets Project’?,"The project aims to increase the evidence base for new nets and reduce the cost to an affordable level to facilitate scale-up should these nets receive a WHO policy recommendation. The project includes the following components:Randomized controlled trials to produce the robust epidemiological evidence needed for WHO to consider making a policy recommendation around these nets.Support procurement of volumes of the new nets that allow a limited number of pilots to take place and can be used as leverage to negotiate lower prices for these new nets.Support effectiveness pilots in four key eco-epidemiological settings within sub-Saharan Africa to help develop a better understanding of the relative cost-effectiveness of these tools compared to standard nets (and in some cases
        to PBO nets). These will be undertaken in 4 sites: Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria and Rwanda. These pilots will be conducted within an intense evaluative framework. Support other ‘operational’ pilots in limited areas where the focus is on allowing early access to these new tools in areas that may particularly benefit from any additional impact, collect operational experience to inform
        lessons learned on conducting national campaigns with multiple types of nets, and support the procurement of the volumes required to bring the price of the product down to an affordable level by the end of the project. The ‘New Nets Project’ supports work on Interceptor® G2 and Royal Guard®, not on pyrethroid-PBO nets."

Which parasite causes HAT?,"The disease is caused by trypanosomes that are unicellular parasitic protozoa. A large number of species and subspecies of trypanosomes have been described, but only two subspecies can cause HAT. Different species of trypanosomes infect a variety of different vertebrates, including animals and humans. Most species are transmitted by insects.HAT occurs only in sub-Saharan Africa. It is caused by two subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei brucei, namely Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (T.b. gambiense) and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (T.b. rhodesiense)."
Why do we specify human in African trypanosomiasis?,African trypanosomiasis also occurs in animals. Animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) is caused by other trypanosome species and subspecies than those affecting human beings. All these diseases have an important economic impact on the development of agriculture in Africa. Those affecting cattle are undoubtedly the most important economically since they are a major cause for reduced meat and milk production and draught power for agricultural production. Occasional infections in humans with these trypanosomes have been described.
How is the parasite that causes HAT transmitted to humans?,"Trypanosomiasis is transmitted to humans and animals by a blood‐sucking insect, the tsetse fly. Both male and female tsetse flies can transmit the infection. Tsetse flies include all the species in the genus Glossina, but not all the species are recognized as vectors of sleeping sickness. Tsetse flies are found on the African continent south of the Sahara. Wild and domestic animals can host these parasites and may represent a reservoir of infection for the tsetse flies.Vertical transmission (mother to child) can happen in infected pregnant women. Blood transfusion and laboratory infection have been described but they are rare."
Are there differences between the sleeping sickness caused by T.b. gambiense and T.b. rhodesiense?,"Yes, there are several differences between these two forms of the disease. First, the transmission circuit differs. T.b. gambiense is transmitted mainly from an infected human to a tsetse fly and then to another human. The transmission cycle of T.b. rhodesiense involves to a great extent domestic and wild animals that act as a reservoir of infection for the tsetse flies. Humans may act as a reservoir also when transmission is intensified during epidemics.Secondly, there are major differences in the symptoms. Infection with T.b. rhodesiense is acute, lasting from a few weeks to several months, while T.b. gambiense infection is chronic, generally progressing slowly over several years."
What are the symptoms of sleeping sickness?,"HAT progresses in two stages. Following the bite of the infected fly, the parasite multiplies in the lymph and the blood of the person bitten, causing unspecific symptoms and signs such as headaches, fever, weakness, pain in the joints and lymphadenopathy. People who become infected may or may not show signs of illness immediately. Over time the parasite crosses the blood–brain barrier and migrates to the central nervous system. This second stage causes various neurological changes including sleep disorders (hence the name “sleeping sickness”), deep sensory disturbances, abnormal tone and mobility, ataxia, psychiatric disorders, seizures, coma and ultimately death."
How is sleeping sickness diagnosed?,"Diagnosis requires parasitological tests to confirm the presence of the parasite in any body fluid, usually in the blood and lymph. The disease stage (haemo-lymphatic or meningo-encephalitic) is determined by examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. Lumbar puncture for staging is usually performed immediately after parasitological diagnosis of trypanosome infection or when indications of infection are present that justify this invasive intervention (e.g. indicative clinical signs or strong serological suspicion)."
Can sleeping sickness be treated?,"Sleeping sickness is difficult to treat because of the toxicity and complex administration of the medicines currently available for treatment. Furthermore, parasite resistance to existing medicines is always a risk.Five medicines are registered for the treatment of HAT: pentamidine, suramin, melarsoprol, eflornithine and fexinidazole. A sixth medicine, nifurtimox, is used in combination under special authorizations. However, none of them are anodyne as all have a certain level of toxicity."
Is it true that lack of iodine really causes brain damage?,"Iodine deficiency is the main cause of brain damage in 
childhood. It results in impaired cognitive and motor development which 
affects a child’s performance at school. In adulthood, it affects 
productivity and the ability to find a job. Iodine-deficient people may 
forfeit 15 IQ points, and nearly 50 million people suffer from some 
degree of iodine deficiency-related brain damage.
		It is particularly important that pregnant women receive 
enough iodine in their diet, as iodine is a key nutrient in the fetal 
development process, especially with respect to the brain. Iodine 
deficiency during pregnancy not only results in brain damage to the 
fetus, but also in low birth weight, prematurity and increased perinatal
 and infant mortality. Young children are also particularly at risk because the brain
 still needs iodine for its development during the first two years of 
life. In addition, iodine deficiency in children is responsible for 
disorders in physical and cognitive development, and hypothyroidism.

The latest global estimate is that 1.88 billion people, 
including 241 million school-age children have insufficient dietary 
iodine intake (1). Even if iodine deficiency may be more severe in 
developing countries, it equally affects developed and developing 
countries.Iodine deficiency can easily be prevented at low cost. One of 
the best and least expensive methods of preventing iodine deficiency 
disorder is by simply iodizing table salt, which is currently done in 
many countries. Where salt iodization has been in place for at least a 
year, improvement in iodine status within the population has been 
overwhelming. It is because of these adverse effects on brain development 
that the 58th World Health Assembly passed a resolution to urge a 
renewed effort from the international community, including WHO and 
UNICEF, to address iodine deficiency in the 54 countries most affected. 
Efforts include:developing strong commitment from public heath authoritieseducation of the publiceffective collaboration with all partners involved especially the salt industrya good monitoring system to make sure that salt is adequately iodizednational legislations on iodized salt that are enforced.

What is opisthorchiasis?,"The term opisthorchiasis, or cat liver fluke disease, indicates two distinct infections: the one with Opisthorchis viverrini, which is referred to as opisthorchiasis viverrini, and the one with Opisthorchis felineus, which is referred to as opisthorchiasis felinea. The adult flukes of both O. viverrini and O. felineus are morphologically similar to those of Clonorchiasis sinensis, measuring up to 20 mm x 5 mm.Opisthorchiasis felinea is a common infection of cats, foxes, dogs, pigs and other fish-eating mammals (reservoir final hosts) in a wide geographical area extending from eastern Europe to central Asia and Siberia. Opisthorchiasis viverrini is a common infection of the civet cat and other fish-eating mammals, such as domestic cats and dogs (reservoir final hosts), in Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Thailand and Viet Nam."
How is opisthorchiasis transmitted?,"The transmission cycle is similar to that of clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis felinea: the adult flukes live in the bile ducts and lay eggs that are dispersed into the environment through defecation.When they reach freshwater, eggs develop into miracidia that are ingested by various species of aquatic snails, where they further develop and reproduce asexually, giving rise to numerous cercariae (larvae). Cercariae leave the snail and pass into water, where they swim to penetrate beneath the scales of various species of carp-like freshwater fish where, as metacercariae, they encyst the subcutaneous tissue. When carnivores eat raw fish, the metacercarial cysts hatch in the intestine and the young worms migrate to the bile ducts, thus completing the cycle.Humans may substitute reservoir hosts in the transmission cycle when they eat raw, salted, pickled, smoked, marinated, dried, partially cooked or poorly processed fish, thus ingesting the metacercariae. In areas where O. felineus is endemic, fish is frequently eaten frozen, salted and smoked."
What are the signs and symptoms of opisthorchiasis?,"In humans, both acute opisthorchiasis viverrini and opisthorchiasis felinea may be asymptomatic or scarcely symptomatic in light infections, but if the number of worms is significant (up to several thousands), fever and right upper-quadrant pain are not infrequent and may be associated with intermittent colic pain caused by obstruction of the gallbladder by the worms themselves. Typically, opisthorchiasis felinea is associated with a more pronounced and severe acute phase than opisthorchiasis viverrini or clonorchiasis.Chronic opisthorchiasis viverrini, which results from protracted episodes of re-infection over time, may be most severe. The presence of the worms in the smaller bile ducts causes chronic inflammation of their walls, resulting in fibrosis of the ducts and destruction of the adjacent liver parenchyma. Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis may also be frequent. Chronic opisthorchiasis viverrini is strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma, a severe and often fatal form of bile duct cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies O. viverrini as a Group 1 agent (carcinogenic to humans).Not much information is available on chronic opisthorchiasis felinea: the presence of the worms in the smaller bile ducts is likely to cause chronic inflammation of their walls, resulting in fibrosis of the ducts and destruction of the adjacent liver parenchyma. Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis may be present. There is insufficient evidence to establish a causal link between opisthorchiasis felinea and cholangiocarcinoma or other forms of liver cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies O. felineus as a Group 3 agent (not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans)."
How is opisthorchiasis diagnosed?,"Diagnosis of both opisthorchiasis felinea and opisthorchiasis viverrini is suspected on the basis of the clinical picture, on the anamnestic recall of consuming raw fish, on the detection of eosinophilia, and on typical findings of ultrasound, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans. Confirmation of diagnosis relies on different types of diagnostic techniques:parasitological techniques to detect Opisthorchis eggs in stool samples; their cost and sensitivity may vary according to the type of technique used; they can only be employed in the chronic phase; some techniques, such as the Kato-Katz thick smear, quantifyimmunological techniques to detect worm-specific antibodies in serum samples or worm-specific antigens in serum or stool samples; these techniques are usually more sensitive than the commonly used parasitological techniques; detection of antibodies does not distinguish between current, recent and past infections; their ability to quantify intensity of infection is disputed; stool tests are easier to perform and reportedly better accepted by individuals in endemic areas; these techniques are still at an experimental stage;molecular techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction are also at an experimental stage."
How is opisthorchiasis treated?,"Praziquantel is the only medicine recommended by WHO for treatment of both opisthorchiasis viverrini and opisthorchiasis felinea. It should be administered at the dose of 25 mg/kg 3 times daily for 2–3 consecutive days or of 40 mg/kg, single administration."
What are the general recommendations for the control of opisthorchiasis?,"For the purposes of public health control of opisthorchiasis viverrini, WHO recommends carrying out community diagnosis at the district level, and implementing preventive chemotherapy with praziquante.Complementary interventions such as information, education and communication on safe food practices, improved sanitation and veterinary public health measures should also be implemented in order to decrease transmission rates.There is insufficient information on the epidemiological pattern of opisthorchiasis felinea to generate adequate recommendations for public health control. As an interim measure, WHO recommends following the same guidelines as those for opisthorchiasis viverrini and clonorchiasis."
Why was the Global vector control response 2017–2030 (GVCR) developed?,"Cognizant of recent major outbreaks of dengue, malaria, chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika virus disease, Member States at the 139th WHO Executive Board meeting in May 2016 requested the Director-General to devise an appropriate response."
What is new about the GVCR?,"The GVCR sets out a new strategy to strengthen vector control worldwide through increased capacity, improved surveillance, better coordination and integrated action."
How was the GVCR developed?,"Development commenced in June 2016 through a fast-tracked and broadly consultative process that was co-led by the WHO Global Malaria Programme, the WHO Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases, and the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases. The strategic approach was welcomed by Member States at the Seventieth World Health Assembly in May 2017, and a dedicated resolution was adopted (WHA70.16)."
"How were the GVCR goals, milestones and targets generated?","These were aligned with Sustainable Development Goal target 3.3 (1), and were formulated on the basis of a comprehensive review of relevant WHO global and regional strategies, plans, frameworks and resolutions on vector-borne diseases.
 These included:

the Global technical strategy for malaria 2016-2030 as adopted by the Sixty-eighth World Health Assembly in May 2015
the Global strategy for dengue prevention and control 2012-2020
resolution WHA66.12 on Neglected tropical diseases adopted by the Sixty-sixth World Health Assembly in May 2013. 

 Targets were based on background modelling that included projections of vector-borne disease burden and risk over the strategic timeframe in order to develop reasonable and achievable targets. These goals, milestones and targets are not intended to replace or override established disease-specific goals, such as for malaria or dengue."
How will the global targets defined in the GVCR apply to individual countries or regions?,"GVCR provides strategic guidance to all Member States and development partners for sustainable vector surveillance and control. It is anticipated that the milestones and targets outlined in the GVCR will be adapted across regions and at national level based on the local situation (for example, diseases, capacity, interventions, and evidence). Countries will establish their own national or subnational targets in reference to national vector-borne disease strategies. Regional strategies and targets may also be developed."
How will the GVCR be implemented?,"Priority activities have been defined for action at national and regional levels. These will need to be supported through broader activities to be undertaken at global level, including those to be undertaken by the WHO Secretariat as well as other partners such as those involved in research and development of new vector control tools, technologies and approaches."
Are the national priority activities to be implemented only at national level?,"In many countries, there is vast geographical and seasonal variation in vector-borne diseases. While GVCR advocates for reforms in national vector control structures, planning and action are not limited to national level. The GVCR emphasizes the need for locally-adapted action, with many of the priority activities to be implemented at provincial and local levels."
What are the major changes that are expected at national level in line with the GVCR? Are all countries expected to have one integrated vector control department?,The required changes at national level will be determined through a comprehensive national vector control needs assessment. National needs assessments are one of the priority activities identified in the GVCR for immediate implementation. It is anticipated that through these needs assessments countries will identify areas that require restructuring/re-orientation for effective vector control programmes to integrate activities and increase efficiency. WHO is currently developing a framework to inform the development of these national vector control needs assessments.
How does the GVCR differ from what is already defined for integrated vector management?,"Integrated vector management is defined as a rational decision-making process for the optimal use of resources for vector control. The GVCR builds on the integrated vector management approach with renewed focus on human capacity at national and subnational levels, as well as strengthened surveillance, infrastructure and management systems. It includes reorienting relevant government programmes around proactive strategies to control new and emerging threats."
How does the GVCR link with One Health concept?,"One Health recognizes that the health of people is connected to the health of animals and the environment. The goal of One Health is to encourage the collaborative efforts of multiple disciplines – working locally, nationally, and globally – to achieve the best health for people, animals, and our environment. A One Health approach is important because six out of every ten infectious diseases in humans are spread from animals. In many parts of the world, several vector-borne diseases such as dengue and yellow fever have a sylvatic transmission cycle in the forests which sustain the reservoir of the disease."
What is the linkage of the GVCR with the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR)?,An IHR network of country-level focal points and coordination of expertise will play a vital role in prevention and control of potential outbreaks. Vector surveillance and control will be strengthened at all ports of entry as per IHR requirements. Active leadership along with improved coordination and strengthened human capacity at national and subnational levels in accordance with GVCR will foster productive engagement and collaboration in the shared vision of vector-borne diseases reduction.
What are the implications of the GVCR for research and its funding?,"The GVCR calls for increased basic and applied research and innovation as a foundation for strengthening vector control. This encompasses the establishment and maintenance of appropriate capacity within national vector-borne disease programmes in order to collect and use data to inform implementation. It includes the establishment of a national research agenda appropriate to the needs of the programme to support evidence-based vector control. While it will also advocate for the development of new tools, this does not extend to financing and coordination for product research and development, which is adequately addressed through initiatives such as the Consultative Expert Working Group on Research and Development, as was discussed under agenda item 13.5 of the Seventieth World Health Assembly."
Is it anticipated that Ministries of Health will be able to make cost savings through integration across disease programmes?,"Given the essential strengthening of health workforce and infrastructure that is outlined in GVCR, it is likely that in many countries there will need to be some initial increase in investment with a focus on programme re-orientation and sustainability. However, the boost in technical capacity and essential resources and locally-adaptive vector control implementation will be more efficient to detect and manage any possible increases in cases or pockets of outbreaks. This is likely to lead to more effective use of vector control tools for maximum impact – thereby protecting these investments in the mid- to long-term. Prevention of outbreaks of vector-borne diseases is expected to be highly cost-effective to all countries."
Who is expected to fund implementation of the GVCR?,"GVCR has been formulated with inputs from Member States and other experts, including existing multilateral and bilateral donors. GVCR funding will depend on country capacity to re-orient programmes with a greater level of accountability, improved management and to leverage regional cooperation mechanisms. It is envisaged that the clear recognition of the importance of the GVCR at the World Health Assembly will lead to greater advocacy for and attract more resources in a time-limited manner based on the identified needs and activities."
What is fascioliasis?,"Fascioliasis belongs to the group of foodborne trematode infections and is a zoonosis, meaning an animal infection that may be transmitted to humans. It is caused by two species of parasitic flatworms or trematodes that mainly affect the liver. The two species of trematodes that cause fascioliasis (Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica) are leaf-shaped worms, large enough to be visible to the naked eye (adult F. hepatica measure 20–30 mm x 13 mm; adult F. gigantica measure 25–75 mm x 12 mm). The disease they both cause is similar."
Where does fascioliasis occur?,"Until recently, human cases occurred occasionally but are now increasingly reported from Europe, the Americas and Oceania (where only F. hepatica is transmitted) and from Africa and Asia (where the two species overlap). WHO estimates that at least 2.4 million people are infected in more than 75 countries worldwide, with several million at risk. No continent is free from fascioliasis, and it is likely that where animal cases are reported, human cases also exist.The epidemiological pattern of fascioliasis is quite varied: the infection usually has a hypo-endemic pattern, with low and stable levels of prevalence among a defined population. Sporadic outbreaks may occur among such populations: these are usually related to sudden changes in climatic conditions that boost the life-cycle of either the parasite or the snail, or both. Scientists have also found that the epidemiology of fascioliasis is strictly linked to the geographical and environmental characteristics of the area where transmission occurs, and different patterns can be distinguished: this suggests that fascioliasis may adapt to different ecological niches.In Africa and Asia, where both F. hepatica and F. gigantica are present, mixed infections are possible. In Asia, hybridization among the two species occurring in co-infected humans or animals has been described. The offspring resulting from such hybridization is characterized by intermediate morphological characteristics between the two species as well as by different ploidies (diploid, triploid, and mixoploid); such worms are frequently non-fertile."
How is fascioliasis transmitted?,"The life-cycle of fascioliasis is complex. It involves a final host (where the adult worm lives), an intermediate host (where the larval stages of the worm develop) and a carrier (entailing suitable aquatic plants).The process starts when infected animals (cattle, sheep, buffaloes, donkeys and pigs but also horses, goats, dromedaries, camels, llamas and other herbivores) defecate in fresh-water sources. Since the worm lives in the bile ducts of such animals, its eggs are evacuated in faeces and hatch into larvae that lodge in a particular type of water snail (the intermediate host).Once in the snail, the larvae reproduce and eventually release more larvae into the water. These larvae swim to nearby aquatic or semi-aquatic plants, where they attach to the leaves and stems and form small cysts (metacercariae). When the plants with the small cysts attached are ingested, they act as carriers of the infection. Watercress and water-mint are good plants for transmitting fascioliasis, but encysted larvae may also be found on many other salad vegetables. Ingestion of free metacercariae floating on water (possibly detached from carrier plants) may also be a possible mode of transmission.Transmission of the infection in the environment is usually perpetuated by animals. Humans do not typically contribute to the parasite's life-cycle; they are only occasionally infected after failure to observe basic hygiene measures (consuming larvae-contaminated uncooked vegetables or drinking larvae-infected water). Moreover, Fasciola worms are not well adapted to humans and, in some cases, fail to develop into mature adult worms and produce eggs."
Who is the most at risk of infection?,"In some areas, transmission to humans is constant and intense, and a geographical aggregation of cases may be observed. This pattern is possibly explained by a human-to-snail-to-plant-to-human transmission cycle, without the involvement of any animal. Indigenous communities in the South American highlands represent well known ""hot spots"" for fascioliasis: here, highly prevalent infection has been reported and may be explained by such transmission pathway.Where it occurs sporadically, fascioliasis affects people from all age-groups, and there is no specific risk group. Where the infection is highly endemic, the prevalence and intensity of infection tend to peak in school-age children. People living in rural areas are typically more likely to become infected; however, cases may occur anywhere and can follow the trade routes of the carrier plants, which are part of the usual diet in many countries."
What are the signs and symptoms of fascioliasis?,"After the larvae are ingested with contaminated food or water, a symptomless incubation period starts, lasting for a few days to a few months. This is followed by an acute and a chronic clinical phase.Acute phase. The acute phase, lasting 2-4 months, begins when the immature worms penetrate the intestinal wall and the peritoneum, the protective membrane surrounding the internal organs . From here, they puncture the liver's surface and eat their way through its tissues until they reach the bile ducts. This invasion kills the liver's cells and causes intense internal bleeding. Typical symptoms include fever, nausea, a swollen liver, skin rashes and extreme abdominal pain.Chronic phase. The chronic phase begins when the worms reach the bile ducts, where they mature and start producing eggs. These eggs are released into the bile and reach the intestine, where they are evacuated in faeces, thereby completing the transmission cycle. Symptoms include intermittent pain, jaundice and anaemia. Pancreatitis, gallstones and bacterial super-infections may also occur. Patients with chronic infections experience hardening of the liver (fibrosis) as a result of the long-term inflammation."
How is fascioliasis diagnosed?,"Diagnosis of fascioliasis may be suspected on the basis of the clinical picture, on the anamnestic recall of consuming raw vegetables, on the detection of eosinophilia (blood eosinophil count >500–1000 per μl of blood), and on typical findings at ultrasound or computed tomography scans. Confirmation relies on different types of diagnostic techniques.parasitological techniques to detect Fasciola eggs in stool samples; their cost and sensitivity may vary according to the type used; they can only be employed in the chronic phase; some of them allow quantifying intensity of infection (therefore estimating the severity of the infection);immunological techniques to detect worm-specific antibodies in serum samples or worm-specific antigens in serum or stool samples; they are usually more sensitive than the commonly used parasitological techniques; detection of antibodies does not allow distinguishing between current, recent and past infections; their ability to quantify intensity of infection is disputed; stool tests are easier to perform and reportedly better accepted by individuals in endemic areas;molecular techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction are still at experimental stage."
How is fascioliasis treated?,"Triclabendazole, the only medicine recommended by WHO against fascioliasis, is active against both immature and adult parasites, and may therefore be employed during the acute and chronic phases. Cure rates are high , while adverse reactions following treatment are usually temporary and mild. The recommended regimen is 10 mg/kg body weight administered as a single dose in both clinical practice and preventive chemotherapy interventions. In clinical practice, where treatment failure occurs, the dosage may be increased to 20 mg/kg body weight in two divided doses 12-24 hours apart."
What are the public health interventions to control fascioliasis?,"From a public health perspective, control of human fascioliasis mainly relies on timely treatment with triclabendazole, a measure that cures infected individuals and prevents development of advanced morbidity.In areas where cases of fascioliasis occur sporadically, clinical case management of individuals reporting to their local hospital is sufficient to tackle the disease. Diagnostic protocols adapted to the socioeconomic environment of endemic areas should be adopted, and triclabendazole should be made available to peripheral health centres with the aim of increasing access to treatment.In communities where cases are clustered, possibilities for implementing large-scale anthelminthic distribution (preventive chemotherapy) in subdistricts, villages or communities where the cluster occurs should be considered. Preventive chemotherapy in such foci can be implemented as targeted treatment of school-age children (5–14 years), usually the population with the highest prevalence and intensity of infection, or as universal treatment (mass drug administration, or MDA) of the entire resident population. In such areas, individual-level diagnosis is not necessary; decisions about treatment are rather based on an assessment of the public health relevance of the disease.Timely treatment with triclabendazole is the quickest way to control morbidity associated with fascioliasis. However, treatment should be complemented, where feasible, by implementing measures that aim to reduce transmission rates, including:information, education and communication, promoting cultivation of vegetables in water free from faecal pollution and thorough cooking of vegetables before consumption;veterinary public health measures, including treating domestic animals and enforcing separation between husbandry and humans;environmental measures such as containment of the snail intermediate hosts and drainage of grazing lands."
What is clonorchiasis?,"Clonorchiasis, or Chinese liver fluke disease, is a foodborne trematodiase infection caused by trematode worms (also called flukes). It is caused by infection with Clonorchis sinensis. Adult C. sinensis flukes may measure up to 20 mm x 5 mm.Clonorchiasis is a common infection of dogs and other fish-eating carnivores (reservoir final hosts) in China, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea and Viet Nam. People may also become infected through the consumption of raw or undercooked fish."
How is clonorchiasis transmitted?,"Adult flukes inhabit the bile ducts and lay eggs that are dispersed into the environment during defecation. When they reach fresh water, eggs develop into miracidia that are ingested by various species of aquatic snails.The miracidia further develop and reproduce asexually into cercariae (larvae). Cercariae leave the snail and swim to penetrate beneath the scales of various species of carp-like freshwater fish where, as metacercariae, they encyst in the subcutaneous tissue. When dogs or other carnivores eat raw fish, the metacercarial cysts hatch in the intestine and the young worms migrate to the bile ducts, thus completing the cycle.Humans may substitute reservoir hosts in the transmission cycle when they eat raw, salted, pickled, smoked, marinated, dried, partially cooked or poorly processed fish, thus ingesting the metacercariae."
What are the symptoms of clonorchiasis?,"In humans, acute clonorchiasis may be asymptomatic or scarcely symptomatic in light infections, but if the number of worms is significant (up to several thousands), fever and right upper-quadrant pain are not infrequent and may be associated with intermittent colic pain caused by the worms obstructing the gallbladder.Chronic clonorchiasis, which results from protracted episodes of re-infection over time, may be most severe. The presence of the worms in the walls of the smaller bile ducts causes chronic inflammation, resulting in fibrosis of the ducts and destruction of the adjacent liver parenchyma. Cholangiohepatitis, or recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, is also frequent. Chronic chlonorchiasis is strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma, a severe and often fatal form of bile duct cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies C. sinensis as a Group 1 agent (carcinogenic to humans)."
How is clonorchiasis diagnosed?,"Diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical picture, on the anamnestic recall of consuming raw fish, on the detection of eosinophilia, and on typical findings of ultrasound, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans. Confirmation of diagnosis relies on different types of diagnostic techniques:parasitological techniques to detect Clonorchis eggs in stool samples; their cost and sensitivity may vary according to the type of technique used; they can only be employed in the chronic phase; some techniques, such as the Kato-Katz thick smear, quantify the intensity of infection (allowing estimation of the severity of the infection);immunological techniques to detect worm-specific antibodies in serum samples or worm-specific antigens in serum or stool samples; they are usually more sensitive than the commonly used parasitological techniques; detection of antibodies does not distinguish between current, recent and past infections; their ability to quantify intensity of infection is disputed; stool tests are easier to perform and reportedly better accepted by individuals in endemic areas; these techniques are still at an experimental stage;molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction are also at an experimental stage."
Can clonorchiasis be treated?,"Praziquantel is the only medicine recommended by WHO for treatment of clonorchiasis. It should be administered at the dose of 25 mg/kg 3 times daily for 2–3 consecutive days or of 40 mg/kg, single administration."
Can clonorchiasis be prevented?,"For the purposes of public health control, WHO recommends carrying out community diagnosis at the district level, and implementing preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel. Complementary interventions such as information, education and communication on safe food practices, improved sanitation and veterinary public health measures should also be implemented in order to decrease transmission rates."
What is the Attacks on Health Care Initiative?,"BackgroundIn 2012, World Health Assembly Resolution 65.20 was adopted. In this resolution, Member States requested WHO to provide leadership at the global level in collecting and disseminating information on attacks on health care in complex humanitarian emergencies. WHO subsequently created the Attacks on Health Care (AHC) initiative to systematically collect evidence on attacks on health care, to advocate for the end of such attacks, and to promote best practices for protecting health care from attacks.GoalThe vision of the initiative is to ensure provision of essential life-saving health services to emergency-affected populations unhindered by any form of violence or obstruction.Ultimately, WHO seeks to ensure that:Health workers everywhere can provide health care in a safe and protected environment;Health workers are protected, resilient and equipped with knowledge and resources;Parties to conflict understand and uphold their responsibilities under International Humanitarian Law;Health care delivery is not disrupted by attacks; andAll forms of violence against health care stop. ObjectivesTo achieve this mission, three main objectives and work streams of the initiative have been established:Develop a body of evidence on the nature and extent of attacks on health care;Increase commitment to action through strong advocacy to end attacks;Assess the impact of attacks on health care delivery, and document good practices to prevent and mitigate consequences of attacks."
Why has WHO undertaken the Attacks on Health Care initiative?,"WHA Resolution 65.20 (2012) called on WHO’s Director-General to provide global leadership in the development of methods for systematic collection and dissemination of data on attacks on health facilities, health workers, health transport and patients in complex humanitarian emergencies, in coordination with other relevant United Nations bodies and partners.The initiative was created in response to this resolution with the understanding that data collection needs to be supported by other areas of work, such as strong advocacy and guidance on how to prevent attacks and increase resilience of health systems, in order to adequately address the issue."
What are attacks on health care?,"WHO defines an attack on health care as any act of verbal or physical violence or obstruction or threat of violence that interferes with the availability, access and delivery of curative and/or preventive health services during emergencies. The nature and types of attacks vary across contexts and can range from violence with heavy weapons to psychological threats and intimidation.Examples of types of attacks on health can include:Violence with individual weaponsViolence with heavy weaponsPsychological violence/threat of violence/intimidationObstruction to delivery of careAssault without weaponsSexual assaultDenial of access to servicesArmed or violent search of health resourceRemoval of health care assets Setting fire to health resourcesMilitarization of health care facility Removal of health care assets"
What health resources can be affected by attacks on health care?,"All health resources can suffer from attacks. Health resources include all personnel, supplies, facilities, transport and warehouses that play a role in the delivery of health services, as well as patients themselves."
What are the reasons behind attacks on health care?,"During emergencies, attacks on health care come in many shapes and forms and stem from various reasons depending on the context in which they took place. To better understand these reasons, it is important to first consider and analyse each attack within their context. Although understanding the context of an attack alone will not answer the full question of why attacks on health care occur, it provides the necessary tools to investigate the roots of the problem. To illustrate, the reasons behind the destruction of a health facility in Libya may be drastically different from those that motivated the destruction of a health centre in DRC during an Ebola outbreak. In Libya, the shelling of a health facility occurs against the backdrop of years of violent conflict, in which attacks on health care have become one of its manifestations. On the other hand, the attacks that took place in DRC during the 2014 Ebola outbreak seem to have targeted health facilities as a reaction to imposed public health measures. At this stage, more research is needed to identify drivers of violence against health care, but looking at the local contexts in which they occur already provides useful clues."
What are the consequences of attacks on health care?,"Attacks not only endanger health care providers; they can also deprive people of urgently needed care. The full extent of the impact of attacks on health care is not yet known. The short-term and more immediate effects are better understood in terms of the facilities or health workers lost, but a more in-depth investigation of the mid- to long-term impact is required. WHO aims to better understand these consequences as defined under the third objective of the initiative- investigating the impact of attacks on health care to the health of the affected populations and health service delivery, availability and accessibility. Furthermore, WHO seeks to document good practices undertaken by various actors to prevent attacks and mitigate the consequences of attacks. These findings will help to generate evidence-based recommendations for health actors to implement at the country level."
What is paragonimiasis?,"Paragonimiasis, or lung fluke disease, is caused by infection with a number of species of trematodes belonging to the genus Paragonimus. The most common are: P. westermani, P. heterotremus and P. philippinensis in Asia (China, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the Philippines, Thailand, Viet Nam and other east Asian countries); P. africanus and P. uterobilateralis in western and central Africa; P. caliensis, P. kellicotti and P. mexicanus in north, central and south America. Adult flukes may measure up to 20 mm x 10 mm."
How is paragonimiasis transmitted?,"Paragonimus spp. is a common parasite of crustacean-eating mammals such as tigers, leopards, domestic cats, dogs, mongooses, opossums and monkeys (reservoir final hosts). The adult flukes live in the lungs and lay eggs that are coughed up through the airways and either expectorated in the sputum or swallowed and defecated. When they reach freshwater, the eggs develop into miracidia that penetrate various species of aquatic snails, where they further develop and reproduce asexually, giving rise to cercariae (larvae).Cercariae released into water swim to penetrate suitable species of freshwater crabs, crayfish and other crustaceans and encyst the gills, liver and muscles as metacercariae. When such animals are eaten, the metacercariae hatch in the intestine: young worms penetrate the intestinal wall and the peritoneum, then the diaphragm and the pleura; they finally reach the lungs, where they live in pairs surrounded by a capsula, thus completing the cycle.Humans may substitute reservoir hosts in the transmission cycle when they eat raw, salted, pickled, smoked, marinated, dried, partially cooked or poorly processed crustaceans, thus ingesting the metacercariae."
What are signs and symptoms of paragonimiasis?,"In humans, the earliest stages of paragonimiasis may present an elusive clinical picture, and be asymptomatic or scarcely symptomatic. Conversely, when worms reach the lungs, symptoms may be significant and typically include chronic cough with blood-stained sputum; chest pain with dyspnoea and fever; pleural effusion and pneumothorax are possible complications.Symptoms and signs mimic those of tuberculosis, and paragonimiasis should always be suspected in patients with tuberculosis who are non-responsive to treatment. Ectopic paragonimiasis may result from erratic migration of the juvenile worms: the most frequent locations include the abdominal cavity and subcutaneous tissues and, most frequently, the brain: cerebral paragonimiasis is a severe condition that may be associated with headache, visual impairment and epileptic seizures."
How is paragonimiasis diagnosed?,"Diagnosis of paragonimiasis is suspected on the basis of the clinical picture, on the anamnestic recall of consuming raw crustaceans, on the detection of eosinophilia, and on typical findings of ultrasound, X-ray, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans. Tests to rule out tuberculosis should always be conducted. Confirmation of diagnosis relies on different types of diagnostic techniques:parasitological techniques to detect Paragonimus eggs in sputum or stool samples.; the cost and sensitivity of these techniques may vary according to the type of technique used; they can only be employed once worms have reached the lungs and started laying eggs; some quantify the intensity of infection (allowing an estimation of the severity of the infection);immunological techniques to detect worm-specific antibodies in serum samples or worm-specific antigens in serum or stool samples; these techniques are usually more sensitive than the commonly used parasitological techniques; detection of antibodies does not distinguish between current, recent and past infections; their ability to quantify intensity of infection is disputed; these techniques are still at an experimental stage;molecular techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction are also still at an experimental stage."
How is paragonimiasis treated?,"Triclabendazole, 20 mg/kg, in two divided doses of 10 mg/kg, to be administered on the same day, and praziquantel 25 mg/kg of body weight, 3 times a day for 3 days, are both WHO-recommended medicines for treatment of paragonimiasis. The former is preferred for the simplicity of its regimen, which ensures higher compliances to treatment."
How can paragonimiasis be controlled?,"The most basic public health measure that should be implemented is making triclabendazole or praziquantel available at peripheral health centres in all endemic areas for clinical management of confirmed cases.In areas where cases appear to be clustered, treatment should be also offered to people with suspected paragonimiasis. Suspected cases are defined as individuals coming from an endemic district with a history of consuming raw crustaceans who present with any of the following characteristics:cough lasting for more than 3 weeks;bloody or rusty sputum;clinically or radiologically diagnosed tuberculosis with a negative sputum smear (smear-negative tuberculosis);poor or no response to tuberculosis treatment.In communities and villages where cases of paragonimiasis appear to be significantly clustered, mass drug administration with triclabendazole should also be considered. The recommended regimen is 20 mg/kg of body weight in a single administration.Complementary interventions such as information, education and communication on safe food practices, improved sanitation and veterinary public health measures should also be implemented in order to decrease rates of transmission."
What is Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)?,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS‐CoV) that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases in humans, ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)."
What are the symptoms of MERS? How severe is it?,"A typical case of MERS includes fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath. Pneumonia is common, however some people infected with the MERS virus have been reported to be asymptomatic. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Severe cases of MERS can include respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive-care unit. Some patients have had organ failure, especially of the kidneys, or septic shock. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in people with weakened immune systems, older people, and people with chronic diseases as diabetes, cancer, and chronic lung disease. The mortality rate for people with the MERS virus is approximately 35% – this may be an overestimate however, as mild cases may be missed by existing surveillance systems."
Is there a vaccine for MERS‐CoV? What is the treatment?,"No vaccine or specific treatment for MERS is currently available, however there are several vaccines for MERS in development. Treatment is supportive and based on a person’s clinical condition."
Where have cases of MERS been identified?,"MERS has been reported in 27 countries since 2012, with approximately 80% of human cases reported by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  Cases identified outside the Middle East are people who were infected in the Middle East and travelled to areas outside the Middle East.  On rare occasions, small outbreaks have occurred in areas outside the Middle East. For the latest information on MERS outbreaks please see: WHO Disease Outbreak News"
How do people get infected with the MERS virus?,"The MERS virus is transmitted primarily from infected dromedary camels to people, but transmission from people to people is also possible.From animals to people MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus, meaning it is transmitted between animals and people.  Scientific evidence suggests that people are infected through unprotected direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. The MERS virus has been identified in dromedary camels in several countries, including Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Jordan, Kenya, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Mali, Morocco, Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Spain (Canary Islands), Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates.. There is further evidence suggesting the MERS-CoV is widespread in dromedary camels in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia.It is possible that other animal reservoirs exist, however animals including goats, cows, sheep, water buffalo, swine, and wild birds have been tested for MERS-CoV and the virus has not been found. Between people The MERS virus does not pass easily between people unless there is close unprotected contact, such as the provision of clinical care to an infected patient without strict hygiene measures. Transmission between people has been limited to-date, and has been identified among family members, patients, and health care workers. The majority of reported MERS cases to date have occurred in health care settings."
Can someone be infected with MERS-CoV and not be ill?,"Yes, infection with MERS-CoV can be asymptomatic. Infected people with no symptoms have been identified because they were tested for MERS-CoV during investigations among contacts of people known to be infected with MERS-CoV. The role of asymptomatic infected individuals in transmission is currently unknown and under investigation."
Is it easy to detect people who are infected with MERS-CoV?,"It is not always possible to identify people infected with the MERS virus because early symptoms of the disease are non-specific. For this reason, all health care facilities should have standard infection prevention and control practices in place. It is also important to investigate the travel history of people with respiratory infection to determine if they have recently visited countries with active MERS-CoV circulation or have had contact with dromedary camels."
What should a person do if she/he has contact with a person who has MERS?,"If you have had close contact with someone infected with MERS-CoV within the last 14 days without using the recommended infection control precautions, you should contact a healthcare provider for an evaluation."
"Should people avoid contact with camels or camel products? Is it safe to visit farms, markets, or camel fairs?","As a general precaution, anyone visiting farms, markets, barns, or other places where animals are present should practice general hygiene measures. These include regular hand-washing before and after touching animals, and avoiding contact with sick animals.The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products, including milk and meat, carries a high risk of infection from a variety of organisms. Animal products processed appropriately through cooking or pasteurization are safe for consumption, but should also be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods. Camel meat and camel milk are nutritious products that can be consumed after pasteurization, cooking, or other heat treatments.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Especially in the Middle East, this group of people should avoid contact with dromedary camels, consuming raw camel milk or camel urine, as well as eating meat that has not been properly cooked.Camel farm and slaughterhouse workers should practice good personal hygiene, including frequent hand washing, facial protection, and protective clothing (which should be removed after work and washed daily). Workers should also avoid exposing family members to soiled work clothing, shoes, or other items that may have come into contact with camels or camel excretions. Sick animals should never be slaughtered for consumption. People should avoid direct contact with any animal that has been confirmed positive for MERS-CoV infection."
Are health care workers at risk from MERS‐CoV?,"Yes. Transmission of MERS-CoV has occurred in health care facilities in several countries, most notably in Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea. It is not always possible to identify patients infected with MERS-CoV early or without testing because symptoms and other clinical features may be non-specific.
For this reason, it is important that health care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients.Droplet precautions should be added to standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for suspected or confirmed cases of MERS. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol‐generating procedures.Infection prevention and control during health care for MERS"
Are there travel restrictions due to MERS-CoV?,"WHO does not currently recommend restrictions on travel or trade with regard to MERS-CoV.National authorities may take precautions to raise awareness of MERS-CoV and its symptoms among travellers, however, based on their own local risk assessment.International travel and health"
What is the impact of mercury on health ?,"Mercury is considered by WHO as one of the top 10 chemicals or groups of chemicals of major public health concern. Exposure to mercury, even in fairly small amounts, may cause serious health problems, and is a particular threat to the development of the child in utero and early in life. Mercury may have toxic effects on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, and on lungs, kidneys, skin and eyes. Individuals are mainly exposed to methylmercury, an organic compound, when they eat fish and shellfish that contain methylmercury. Mercury releases in the environment result mainly from human activity, particularly from coal-fired power stations, residential heating systems, waste incinerators and as a result of mining for mercury, gold and other metals."
What is thiomersal ?,"Thiomersal is a compound containing ethyl mercury used to prevent bacterial and fungal growth in inactivated (in which the virus has been killed) vaccines presented in multi-dose vials. It is also used during vaccine production, both to inactivate certain organisms and toxins and to help maintain a sterile production line. Thiomersal has been used since the 1930s in the manufacture of some vaccines and other medicinal products. The manufacture of thiomersal is a very minor component (<0.1%) of="""" the="""" main="""" sources="""" of="""" human="""" exposure="""" to="""">"
Why do vaccines need preservatives ?,"Preservatives inhibit growth of bacterial and fungal contaminants, which may be introduced during repeated use of a multi-dose vial. Multi-dose vials are used in many countries because they require less storage space in the cold chain and lead to less wastage, both of which have a significant impact on programme costs. While a preservative is needed only for multi-dose presentations, a manufacturer will usually make one bulk formulation, so if the product has both multi-dose and single-dose presentations, the-single dose presentation would contain the same preservative. In many countries, for inactivated vaccines supplied in multi-dose vials, the presence of a preservative is a regulatory requirement."
Which vaccines contain thiomersal ?,"Vaccines that contain thiomersal include those against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP), hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), rabies, influenza and meningococcal diseases. Usually, these vaccines have thiomersal added in varying concentrations (8 to 50 µg per dose) as a preservative. Also, some vaccines may contain trace amounts of thiomersal (<0.5 µg="""" per="""" dose)="""" if="""" it="""" has="""" been="""" used="""" in="""" the="""" production="""" process="""" as="""" an="""" inactivating="""" agent,="""" but="""" has="""" not="""" been="""" added="""" to="""" the="""" final="""" product="""" as="""" a="""">
Thiomersal-containing vaccines are used widely across the world. A number of products containing thiomersal have been prequalified by WHO (i.e. they have been assessed by WHO as meeting international standards for assured quality, safety and efficacy) and are being supplied by United Nations procurement agencies. During 2010, UNICEF and the Pan American Health Organization Revolving Fund supplied 325 million doses of thiomersal-containing vaccines for routine vaccination activities and response to outbreaks of infectious diseases such as influenza or epidemic meningitis."
Which vaccines do not contain thiomersal ?,"Live vaccines, such as oral poliovirus vaccine; yellow fever vaccine; and measles, mumps and rubella vaccines, do not contain thiomersal, because it would kill the immunizing component. In inactivated vaccines, when only single-dose presentations are available from a particular manufacturer, there is no thiomersal component in sufficient concentration required to prevent contamination of a vial because those presentations are not meant to be reused."
Does the amount of thiomersal in vaccines pose a health risk ?,"WHO has closely monitored scientific evidence relating to the use of thiomersal as a vaccine preservative for over 10 years, in particular through its independent expert advisory group, the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety. The Committee has consistently reached the same conclusion: there is no evidence to suggest that the amount of thiomersal used in vaccines poses a health risk. Other expert groups (the U.S. Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the United Kingdom Committee on Safety of Medicines, and the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products), have reached similar conclusions."
Why are the United States of America and other industrialized countries avoiding use of thiomersal in vaccines if there is no proven safety risk ?,"The USA does use thiomersal-containing vaccines. During the 2010-2011 influenza season, more than 90 million doses of thiomersal-containing influenza vaccine in multi-dose vials were distributed for the vaccination of American citizens. Intensive safety studies showed that these vaccines were safe and effective. Other industrialized countries also used thiomersal-containing pandemic influenza vaccines.
The concerns that were raised in 1999 in the USA regarding exposure to mercury following immunization with thiomersal-containing vaccines were based on the calculation that the cumulative amount of mercury in infant immunization schedules potentially exceeded the recommended threshold for methyl mercury set by a U.S. government agency. At the time the concerns were raised, there was scientific uncertainty over the issue and the regulator (the United States Food and Drug Administration), taking a precautionary approach, requested manufacturers to consider development of thiomersal-free products for routine immunization. However, thiomersal contains ethyl mercury, not methyl mercury, and ethyl and methyl mercury are quite different. Studies have subsequently shown that withdrawal of thiomersal-containing vaccines had no effect on conditions, such as autism, which had been linked by some advocates to use of thiomersal-containing vaccines."
Can you provide more information on the studies reviewed by the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety ?,"Since August 2000, the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS), responsible for advising WHO on vaccine safety issues of potential global importance, has periodically reviewed available information on thiomersal pharmacokinetic studies in humans (including low birth-weight infants) and in monkeys and has assessed the validity of animal models in studying associations between thiomersal and neuro-developmental disorders (such as autism) in humans.
Expert consultation and data presented to GACVS indicate that the pharmacokinetic profile of ethyl mercury is substantially different to that of methyl mercury. In particular, the half-life of ethyl mercury is short (6 days; 95% CI: 3-10 days) compared with 40-50 days for methyl mercury, making exposure to ethyl mercury in blood comparatively brief and preventing accumulation when vaccines are administered at least four weeks apart. Further, ethyl mercury is actively excreted via the gut, unlike methyl mercury, which accumulates in the body. This rapid elimination of ethyl mercury has been confirmed in all studies reviewed, even those that looked at low birth-weight infants.
Four independent epidemiological studies investigating associations and frequency of neuro-developmental disorders in relation to vaccination with thiomersal-containing vaccines from the United Kingdom and Denmark did not challenge the safety of existing thiomersal-containing vaccines in infants.
GACVS also reviewed a series of studies by Geier and Geier alleging reduction of neuro-developmental disorders in the USA following discontinuation of thiomersal-containing vaccines in the national immunization programme. The Committee found a number of methodological limitations, such that published outcomes regarding neurodevelopment and heart disease following administration of thiomersal-containing vaccines do not meet the scientific criteria required to suggest a causal relationship. The Committee therefore found the conclusions made by these authors both unconvincing and unsubstantiated.
On that basis the GACVS considers that pharmacokinetic and developmental studies undertaken do not support concerns over the safety of thiomersal in vaccines.
The Committee has concluded that there is no reason on grounds of safety to change current immunization practices with thiomersal-containing vaccines, as the alleged risks are unproven."
"What would be the public health impact of restricting manufacture, distribution or use of thiomersal-containing vaccines ?","Immunization with thiomersal-containing multi-dose vaccines currently protects at least 64% of all infants and children against four diseases with high mortality rates: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type b. It is estimated that use of thiomersal-containing vaccines to protect against these diseases averted at least 1 400 000 child deaths in 2010. Thiomersal-containing vaccines are being used in over 120 countries. Removing thiomersal completely from vaccines would require either using alternative preservatives or using preservative-free single-dose vaccines exclusively. Alternative presentations (with other preservatives, or preservative-free) would incur significant costs for development and regulatory approval, thereby limiting the ability to offer affordable vaccines.
Use of multi-dose vials is the most efficient and cost-effective presentation for protection of populations in instances when vaccines need to be administered to large numbers of people in a short space of time, such as in epidemic or pandemic situations."
Are there alternative preservatives that could be used for vaccines ?,"Yes, there are two approved for use. 2-phenoxyethanol (used for inactivated polio vaccine) and phenol (used for typhoid vaccine). A few studies have been done to compare the effectiveness of the different preservatives but the data is limited and inconclusive. Extrapolation from a few examples that an alternative preservative can be used for all vaccines is speculation. Practically, any vaccine presentation for which another preservative is to be used for the first time will require new clinical evaluation to test for safety and efficacy."
Is there research ongoing to evaluate the relative effectiveness of alternative preservatives to thiomersal ?,"WHO does not have a research programme for evaluating alternatives to the use of thiomersal in vaccines, given the lack of scientific evidence suggesting that there is a need to do so. Vaccine manufacturers have conducted research into alternative preservatives but, except for research on inactivated polio vaccine and a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, there has been a conspicuous lack of success."
Could supplying vaccines in single-dose vials only be an option ?,"Vaccines could be supplied in preservative-free single-dose vials as is the case for the majority of vaccines used in industrialized countries. However, this option requires a significant increase in manufacturers' filling capacity. This would be time consuming and expensive to implement and it may not be possible to produce sufficient single-dose product to ensure uninterrupted global supply.
There is also the vaccine cost element: vaccines supplied in single-dose vials are more expensive than a dose of vaccine from a multi-dose vial.
In addition, single-dose vials require significantly larger cold storage space as well as increased transport capacity, which is currently not feasible for the majority of countries. Current WHO estimates suggest that the vaccine storage requirements would at least double if only single-dose presentations were used (WHO vaccine volume calculator, March 2011). Upgrading the cold chains of those countries is limited by local resources and the additional maintenance requirements that would render many existing systems vulnerable.
Replacing thiomersal in vaccines would require regulatory approval. There is no guarantee of obtaining a vaccine of equivalent quality, safety and efficacy following replacement of thiomersal as an inactivating agent or replacement or removal of thiomersal as the preservative from an existing licensed product. This would require a new licensing application, including conducting of new manufacturing validation studies; and pre-clinical and clinical studies. Such processes take time and money, could lead to an increase in vaccine cost and could interrupt global supply of the vaccines, thereby leading to increased disease and death from vaccine-preventable diseases."
Could supplying vaccines in multi-dose vials without a preservative be an option ?,"No, this is not an option because it would be dangerous. Bacterial and fungal contaminants, which may be introduced during repeated use of a multi-dose vial, would have an opportunity to grow in the partially-used vials. This is why the presence of a preservative is a regulatory requirement."
What would be the environmental impact of switching to single-dose vials only ?,"The environmental cost of replacing all multi-dose vials with single-dose vials must be taken into consideration. Such a switch would involve more raw materials, more energy for manufacturing processes and transport, and more waste. Although a formal environmental impact assessment has not yet been done, it should not be assumed that thiomersal-free presentations of vaccines will yield a positive net effect on the environment."
Why is thiomersal in vaccines considered safe by WHO whereas mercury in some cosmetics is considered unsafe ?,"Mercury in cosmetics exists in two forms: inorganic and organic mercury. The form of mercury used in skin lightening soaps and creams is inorganic mercury. Many countries have banned mercury skin lightening products because they are hazardous to human health. Organic mercury compounds (thiomersal (ethyl mercury) and phenyl mercuric salts) are used as cosmetic preservatives in eye makeup cleansing products and mascara. As with vaccines that contain thiomersal, safe limits have been defined for organic mercury compounds in these products."
What is WHO's position on the use of thiomersal in vaccines ?,"WHO supports continued use of thiomersal as an inactivating agent and preservative for vaccines.
The reasons for this position are as follows:

regular review by WHO's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety of new studies relating to the safety of thiomersal in vaccines over more than a decade has not provided any evidence to suggest a possible health hazard with the amounts of thiomersal currently used in vaccines; and
the use of multi-dose vials remains the best option for routine immunization programmes in many countries because they are safe and effective, they limit the required storage capacity and waste, and help reduce vaccine costs."
What is WHO's role in the process of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to prepare a global legally binding instrument on mercury (INC) ?,"WHO participates in the treaty process as an observer. As well as being present at the INC sessions, the Organization can provide submissions, technical briefings, and contributions to Secretariat meeting documents."
What is the overall goal of the treaty ?,The overall goal of the treaty is to protect human health and the environment by reducing mercury releases
"What is WHO's position on thiomersal-containing vaccines, as they pertain to the treaty ?","WHO supports continued use of thiomersal as an inactivating agent and preservative for vaccines. In this context, WHO is concerned about the potential inclusion of vaccines in the scope of the treaty given the lack of evidence that thiomersal presents a risk to human health."
The disease - What is meningococcal disease?,"Meningitis is an infection of the meninges, the thin lining that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord. It is usually caused by a virus or bacterium (meningococcus). It is transmitted through droplets of respiratory or throat secretions. Bacterial meningitis, such as meningococcal disease, can be very serious because it evolves rapidly and can kill in a few hours. Even with appropriate treatment, around10% of patients die, and up to 20% of survivors have serious permanent health problems as a result of the disease (deafness, epilepsy, cerebral palsy or mental retardation)."
What is the extent of meningococcal disease in Africa?,"Sub-Saharan Africa has been experiencing explosive and repeated meningococcal epidemics for more than a hundred years. Group A meningococcus is the main cause of meningitis epidemics and accounts for an estimated 80% to 85% of all cases. These deadly epidemics occur at intervals of 7–14 years in the 25 countries of the ""meningitis belt,"" a strip of land that extends from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. Around 450 million people in this area are at risk of disease.More than one million cases of meningitis have been reported in Africa since 1988. In 1996-1997, the largest epidemic wave ever recorded swept across Africa, causing more than 250 000 cases and 25 000 deaths."
The vaccine - What is the expected public health impact of this new vaccine?,"If introduced in all 25 countries of the African meningitis belt, this vaccine is expected to eliminate the primary cause of epidemic meningitis, meningococcal A, from the entire region, with an estimated 150 000 young lives saved by 2015."
What advantages does MenAfriVac have over existing polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines currently used to combat epidemics in Africa?,"Contrary to polysaccharide vaccines that are used currently to control epidemics after they have begun, the new conjugate vaccine will be offered to prevent epidemics. Key advantages of the new vaccine over existing polysaccharide vaccines are:it induces a higher and more sustainable immune response against the most prominent strain in the most affected age groups, from 1-29 years;it is expected to confer long-term protection not only for those who receive the vaccine, but on family members and others who would otherwise have been exposed to meningitis, given reduced transmission:it will be available at a lower price than other meningococcal vaccines, and significantly lower than other cutting-edge vaccines recently introduced in Africa; andit is expected to be particularly effective in protecting children under two years of age, who do not respond to conventional polysaccharide vaccines."
Will this vaccine protect against all types of meningococcal disease?,"No, MenAfriVac will only protect again disease caused by the group A meningococcus—the main cause of meningitis epidemics in Africa, accounting for about 80 to 85 percent of all cases. Meningitis cases caused by other groups, such as W135, X and C, also occur. Vaccines for other groups are either not yet available (X) or far too expensive for African countries (C, W, or Y in various combinations). However, it is hoped that a combination of ongoing research and development efforts and tiered pricing will contribute to making these vaccines available to developing countries in the future."
How was the vaccine developed?,"The new vaccine was developed through the Meningitis Vaccine Project (MVP), a product development partnership between WHO and PATH, an international non-profit organization. The project included transfer of technology for manufacture of the vaccine from CBER/FDA to the Serum Institute of India Ltd. The project was set up in 2001 with core funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The overall mission of the MVP is to eliminate meningitis as a public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa through the development, testing, introduction, and widespread use of conjugate meningococcal vaccines.Clinical trials, beginning in 2005, have been carried out in the Gambia, Ghana, India, Mali and Senegal and have shown the vaccine to be safe and highly immunogenic."
How much will the vaccine cost?,"The vaccine will be sold at less than 50US¢ per dose, a price low enough to promote widespread uptake throughout the affected region."
What is the timeline for vaccination campaigns across the meningitis belt?,"Country-wide vaccination in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger is scheduled to start in December. The campaign in Burkina Faso is expected to be completed by the end of this year. The campaigns in Mali and Niger are expected to finish in 2011. It is hoped that all countries in the meningitis belt will be using the vaccine by 2015."
Why start with mass vaccination campaigns?,"The goal of introducing the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine through mass vaccination campaigns of 1 to 29 year olds (the age group most at risk) is to immediately and drastically reduce carriage and transmission of the bacteria in order to rapidly reduce rates of death and illness caused by the disease. Because large population groups will be vaccinated in a short period of time, the benefits of immunization should be quickly visible; their impact is expected to be considerable.It is expected that future birth cohorts will be protected either through vaccination within the EPI schedule or through follow-up mass campaigns targeting 1-4 year-olds every five years."
Is there commitment in Africa for the introduction of this vaccine?,"Because of the prevalence of meningitis A in the population and the role it plays as a major cause of epidemics, controlling meningitis A has become an important public health priority in Africa. Countries in the meningitis belt have been eager to host the clinical trials of the vaccine and have contributed significantly to their success. The same enthusiasm now fuels introduction of the vaccine throughout the region. The first three countries to introduce MenAfriVac are contributing financially as much as national budgets allow."
Funding shortfalls and cost-savings: How much money will be required to eliminate epidemic meningitis as a public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa?,It is estimated that introduction of the vaccine in all meningitis belt countries will require the mobilization from donor governments and others of an additional US$ 475 million.It is hoped that the international community will supplement the national budgets of introducing countries to ensure that this funding gap is met.
Funding shortfalls and cost-savings: What are the expected cost savings due to introduction of this new vaccine?,"A very conservative estimate, looking only at treatment and vaccination, is probably a minimum of around US$20 million in an average year in Africa's meningitis belt. This does not include the expected economic impact of saving lives and preventing disabilities caused by epidemic meningitis. Nor does it include the expected impact of freeing up resources for essential health services, which are usually put on hold during the six to seven months of an epidemic."
Next steps - What are the Meningitis Vaccine Project's next steps?,"In addition to actively seeking funding that will guarantee vaccine introduction throughout the whole meningitis belt, MVP is working closely both with governments and institutions in the African region, and international partners, to monitor the effect of the new vaccine on the ground. The project is also conducting further clinical research to inform policy, in particular for infants, to determine how best to integrate the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine into existing routine immunization programmes in Africa."
Why is GMP important?,"Poor quality medicines are not only a health hazard, but a waste of money for both governments and individual consumers."
Poor quality medicines can damage health,A poor quality medicine may contain toxic substances that have been unintentionally added.A medicine that contains little or none of the claimed ingredient will not have the intended therapeutic effect.
GMP helps boost pharmaceutical export opportunities,Most countries will only accept import and sale of medicines that have been manufactured to internationally recognized GMP. Governments seeking to promote their countries' export of pharmaceuticals can do so by making GMP mandatory for all pharmaceutical production and by training their inspectors in GMP requirements.
What is GMP?,"Good manufacturing practice (GMP) is a system for ensuring that products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards. It is designed to minimize the risks involved in any pharmaceutical production that cannot be eliminated through testing the final product. The main risks are: unexpected contamination of products, causing damage to health or even death; incorrect labels on containers, which could mean that patients receive the wrong medicine; insufficient or too much active ingredient, resulting in ineffective treatment or adverse effects. GMP covers all aspects of production; from the starting materials, premises and equipment to the training and personal hygiene of staff. Detailed, written procedures are essential for each process that could affect the quality of the finished product. There must be systems to provide documented proof that correct procedures are consistently followed at each step in the manufacturing process - every time a product is made. WHO has established detailed guidelines for good manufacturing practice. Many countries have formulated their own requirements for GMP based on WHO GMP. Others have harmonized their requirements, for example in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), in the European Union and through the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention."
Is GMP necessary if there is a quality control laboratory?,Yes. Good quality must be built in during the manufacturing process; it cannot be tested into the product afterwards. GMP prevents errors that cannot be eliminated through quality control of the finished product. Without GMP it is impossible to be sure that every unit of a medicine is of the same quality as the units of medicine tested in the laboratory.
Can manufacturers afford to implement GMP?,"Yes. Making poor quality products does not save money. In the long run, it is more expensive finding mistakes after they have been made than preventing them in the first place. GMP is designed to ensure that mistakes do not occur. Implementation of GMP is an investment in good quality medicines. This will improve the health of the individual patient and the community, as well as benefiting the pharmaceutical industry and health professionals. Making and distributing poor quality medicines leads to loss of credibility for everyone: both public and private health care and the manufacturer."
WHO works to strengthen GMP,"WHO GMP guidelines are available online. If you require more information, please contact the WHO representative in your country, your WHO regional office or WHO headquarters in Geneva."
What is meant by a fair price?,"For the purposes of this initiative a ‘fair’ price is one that is affordable for health systems and patients and that at the same time provides sufficient market incentive for industry to invest in innovation and the production of medicines. In other words, fairness here implies positive incentives and/or benefits for all stakeholders – i.e. those who purchase and use medicines, and those involved in the R&D and manufacture of medicines."
Does the concept of ‘fair pricing’ replace the principle of affordability?,"Absolutely not. The Fair Pricing Forum strives to increase access through better affordability. It focuses on new, high-priced medicines and vaccines that are currently unaffordable in most countries – regardless of income. But it also looks at old medicines whose prices have been so reduced that they no longer present any kind of incentive for manufacturers. The principle of affordability and access to quality medicines guides the fair pricing initiative and remains a stalwart of WHO’s work on access to medical products."
Pricing Forum taking place?,"The Forum is taking place in Johannesburg, South Africa, on 11-13 April 2019 and is co-sponsored by the South African National Department of Health and WHO."
Is it a WHO or a South African initiative?,"Fair pricing is a WHO initiative supported by many governments, including the Government of South Africa through its Minister of Health, who will be hosting the forum along with the WHO Director-General."
What does it aim to achieve?,"The ‘Fair Pricing Forum’ aims to provide a global platform to discuss ways to improve access to medicines – including high-priced ones – within the overall effort of supporting countries to develop effective access strategies to achieve universal health coverage. At the same time, it also intends to understand the input needed by the pharmaceutical industry to improve R&D and innovation from a public health perspective and to keep old and generic essential medicines on the market."
Who will be invited to participate in the forum?,"Participants include WHO Member State Governments, patient associations, civil society, insurers and the pharmaceutical industry."
What is at the origin of the fair pricing forum – why now?,"The intention behind the fair pricing initiative is closely linked to WHO’s broader agenda for supporting access to medicines, improving public health across all regions and promoting universal health coverage. In addition, WHO Member States have formally requested that WHO’s Director General, through World Health Assembly Resolution WHA67.22 (Access to essential medicines, 2014), support countries to “ensure access to safe, effective and quality-assured essential medicines, including high price essential medicines.”The current status of medicines prices is fast becoming one of the biggest challenges to health systems everywhere and is the subject of countless debates in parliaments and in both medical and mainstream media. The time is ripe for greater involvement of the global health community to discuss this issue and seek realistic solutions for greater affordability. The main barrier to accessing many new and effective medicines, especially for cancer and orphan drugs, and more recently for hepatitis C, is their lack of affordability, even when there is evidence to show that manufacturing them is relatively inexpensive. This problem is now touching not only low-income countries, it is affecting middle- and high-income countries as well.At the other end of the spectrum is the problem of drug shortages or poor quality for some old and off-patent medicines. There are a number of examples, ranging from benzathine penicillin to methotrexate, where there are significant problems with lack of manufacturers. For these products, it is necessary to work out what a ‘fair’ price would be that ensures quality products and ongoing supply."
What is WHO’s role in this field?,"WHO has both the mandate and the responsibility to address barriers to accessing health products and services that are vital to improving public health. As the global health coordinator within the UN system, WHO provides a unique global platform to discuss policy options for increased access to medicines through its convening power with all public health actors, both national and international."
What evidence/data will WHO use to argue for fairness in pricing?,"In the lead-up to the forum, WHO will publish reports and landscape analyses related to pricing and the cost of R&D and production of medicines and other health technologies. It is hoped that a comprehensive report on pricing will be ready for launch at the May forum."
"How does this fair pricing initiative fit in with the GSPOA, CEWG and the UNHLP on access to medicines?","Fair pricing focuses on specific issues related to pricing (high and low prices) that constitute access barriers in an attempt to find strategies for countries to address these barriers in the near future. We believe that this initiative will contribute to the goals of the Global Strategy and Plan of action on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property (GSPOA), the Consultative Expert Working Group on Research and Development (CEWG) and the UN High Level Panel on Access to Medicines. The initiative does not replace WHO’s ongoing work on intellectual property and TRIPS flexibilities."
Why do so many women still die in pregnancy or childbirth?,"In 2015, an estimated 303 000 women will die from complications
 related to pregnancy or childbirth. In addition, for every woman who 
dies in childbirth, dozens more suffer injury, infection or disease.
		The majority of maternal deaths are due to haemorrhage, 
infection, unsafe abortion, and eclampsia (very high blood pressure 
leading to seizures), or from health complications worsened in 
pregnancy. In all these cases,  unavailable, inaccessible, unaffordable,
 or poor quality care is fundamentally responsible. Maternal deaths are 
detrimental to social development and wellbeing, as some 1 million 
children are left motherless each year. These children are more likely 
to die within 1-2 years of their mothers' death.Women need not die in childbirth. We must give a young woman 
the information and support she needs to address her reproductive health
 needs, help her through a pregnancy, and care for her and her newborn 
well into childhood. The vast majority of maternal deaths could be 
prevented if women had access to quality family planning services; 
skilled care during pregnancy, childbirth and after delivery; or 
post-abortion care and where permissible, safe abortion services.  
Increased attention for women living in conflict situations, or under 
humanitarian crisis is needed because a working health system with 
skilled personnel is key to saving these women's lives.Although the world did not achieve the Millennium Development 
Goal of reducing maternal mortality by three quarters between 1990 and 
2015; great strides were made and many countries saw significant 
improvements in maternal health.  Looking beyond 2015, WHO is committed 
to support accelerated reductions in maternal mortality by 2030, as part
 of the Sustainable Development Goals agenda.  For this to happen, high 
quality reproductive, maternal and newborn health care must be 
available, accessible and acceptable to all in need.  As part of the 
Ending Preventable Maternal Mortality Strategy and objectives, WHO and 
partners support countries to achieve this goal, so that women, girls 
and adolescents can survive and thrive."
Do dead bodies cause epidemics?,"No, dead bodies from natural disasters generally do not cause epidemics. This is because victims of such disasters usually die from trauma, drowning or fire and do not normally harbour organisms which cause epidemics.The exception to this is when deaths have occurred from highly infectious diseases (such as Ebola, Lassa fever, cholera), or when the disaster occurred in an area that is endemic for such highly infectious diseases. In these circumstances, the possibility of disease spreading from dead bodies exists."
What are the health risks for the public?,"Unless the deceased has died from a highly infectious disease, the risk to the public is negligible. However, there is a risk of diarrhoea from drinking water contaminated by faecal material from dead bodies. Routine disinfection of drinking water is sufficient to prevent waterborne illness. (See question 6 for the health risks to those handling dead bodies)."
Can dead bodies contaminate water?,"Yes, they can, as do live bodies. Dead bodies often leak faeces which may contaminate rivers or other water sources, causing a risk of diarrhoeal illness which adequate treatment of water can prevent."
Is spraying bodies with disinfectant or lime powder useful?,"Lime powder does not hasten decomposition and, since dead bodies are generally not an infectious risk to the public, disinfectant is not needed."
Local officials and journalists say there is a risk to the public of disease from dead bodies. Are they correct?,"The risk from dead bodies after disasters due to natural hazards is misunderstood by many professionals and the media. Even local or international health workers are often misinformed and contribute to the spread of unfounded rumours about outbreaks and epidemics. Dead bodies from natural disasters generally do not cause epidemics. The risk of disease from dead bodies is real only in cases where the deceased has died of a highly infectious disease or has died in an area where such infectious disease is endemic. Even then, the risk of disease transmission to a trained body-handler is low (see question 6)"
Is there a risk for those handling dead bodies?,"For people handling dead bodies (rescue workers, mortuary workers, etc.), there is a risk if the deceased are infected with highly infectious disease (such as Ebola, Lassa fever, cholera). The infectious agents responsible for these diseases last for varying periods after death. The internal organs that harbour organisms such as tuberculosis, which can survive for very long periods after a person’s death, are usually handled only by trained personnel during an actual autopsy. This is not part of any procedure described in this manual. Processes to support persons handling the dead should be in place to deal with any psychological impacts arising from their work."
Should workers wear a mask?,"The smell from decaying bodies is unpleasant, but the smell itself is not a health risk in well-ventilated areas, and in such areas wearing a mask is not generally required for health reasons. However, special masks may be required for health and safety purposes in some circumstances, including in the presence of toxic gases, smoke, particles, etc."
What should the authorities do with dead bodies in the short term?,"Dead bodies should be collected and stored, using refrigerated containers where possible, or temporary burial. The simple steps required to help identify all the dead bodies should be taken. Photographs should be taken and descriptive information recorded for each body. Remains should be stored or buried temporarily to allow for the possibility of an expert forensic investigation in the future."
Should mass graves be used to speed up the disposal of dead bodies?,"The rapid mass burial of victims on public health grounds is not justified. Rushing to dispose of bodies without having taken photographs and relevant information from them, and without keeping track of the location of each body, traumatizes families and communities. If these simple steps to identify the greatest possible number of bodies are taken, serious social and legal consequences for families can be avoided. In exceptional circumstances, the use of communal graves as a form of temporary traceable storage and protection of dead bodies is acceptable if properly managed."
How urgent is the collection of dead bodies?,"Body collection is not the most urgent task after a disaster from natural hazards. The priority is to rescue and care for survivors. Nevertheless, bodies should be collected and photographed as soon as possible (and preferably before decomposition has commenced), basic information about the bodies should be collected and recorded, unique body codes allocated, and the bodies should be temporarily stored to protect them and to assist possible identification. The earlier this is done, the greater the number of bodies which will be identified. In the presence of an epidemic of highly infectious disease, collection and proper management of dead bodies by trained personnel is an urgent priority."
What are the minimum steps needed to identify as many dead bodies as possible?,"Identifying dead bodies following disasters can be complex. The minimum steps needed to identify as many dead bodies as possible are set out in the Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters manual. In general terms, identifying a dead body is done by comparing information about the person while alive with information about the dead body. Thus, information about those who are missing or presumed to be dead is needed (a list of the missing, and specific individual information about each missing person). Also, information about the dead body is needed (photographs, preferably taken before decomposition has started, and information about identifying features, clothing and personal effects). To keep track of this information, the body needs to be given a unique code which must be in all the photographs, and on all the information collected; and attached to the body and the body bag, and any burial site, so that its location can be recorded, and the body retrieved at any time. Ideally, forensic experts should be involved, but this is not always possible."
What are the potential mental health issues for the bereaved?,"The overwhelming desire of relatives (from all religions and cultures) is to identify their loved ones. All efforts to identify the bodies will help. Grieving and traditional individual burial (or other means of disposal of the body) are important factors for the personal and communal recovery or healing process. In the case of epidemics, traditional burial rites may not be appropriate because of the health risks involved. The psychological issues arising from this must be taken into consideration."
How should bodies of foreigners be managed?,"Overseas families of visitors killed in a disaster, just like local families, will be hoping their loved one is identified, and the body is returned to them. Proper identification has family, social, economic and diplomatic implications. The simple steps required (allocation of a unique body code, photographs, data from the dead bodies collected and stored) will maximize the number of foreigners identified. Foreign consulates and embassies should be informed, and other relevant agencies (ICRC, Interpol, etc.) should be contacted for assistance."
I am a volunteer: how can I help?,"To be helpful you could promote the proper recovery and management of dead bodies and assist in recording the necessary information. You could also assist with the recovery and disposal of the dead, under the direction of a recognized coordinating authority. However, you would first need to be briefed, advised, trained, equipped and supported for this difficult task. The field manual on Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters should be the framework for your participation."
I represent an NGO: how can I help?,"Providing support for families and collecting information in collaboration with the coordinating authority will best help the surviving relatives. You may also promote proper identification and treatment of the dead, including through dissemination of the field manual on Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters. NGOs should not be asked to manage the dead unless they are trained for this task and work for and under the direct supervision of a legal authority.Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters: A Field Manual for First Responders Second Edition"
I am a health professional: how can I help?,The survivors need you more than the dead. Any professional help in fighting the myth of epidemics caused by dead bodies will be appreciated. Talk about this with your colleagues and representatives of the media referencing the field manual on Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters.
I am a journalist: how can I help?,"If you hear comments or statements regarding the need for mass burial or incineration of bodies to avoid epidemics, challenge them. Promote an understanding of the field manual on Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters, including by referring to it in your reports. If necessary, do not hesitate to consult the appropriate persons at WHO, PAHO, ICRC, IFRC or the local Red Cross/Red Crescent office."
What are malnutrition and starvation?,"Malnutrition comes in many forms. Simply put, it means poor nutrition. It includes:

undernutrition: when a person does not get enough food to eat,
    causing them to be wasted (this is also called acute malnutrition, when
    someone is too thin for their height) and/or stunted (this is also
    called chronic malnutrition, when someone is too short for their age).
    Undernutrition increases the risk of infectious diseases like diarrhoea,
    measles, malaria and pneumonia, and chronic malnutrition can impair a
    young child’s physical and mental development.
micronutrient deficiencies: when a person does not get enough
    important vitamins and minerals in their diet. Micronutrient
    deficiencies can lead to poor health and development, particularly in
    children and pregnant women.
overweight and obesity: linked to an unbalanced or unhealthy diet
    resulting in eating too many calories and often associated with lack of
    exercise. Overweight and obesity can lead to diet-related
    noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure
    (hypertension), stroke, diabetes and cancer.

Starvation is a severe lack of food which can result in death."
How big a problem is malnutrition in emergencies?,"In emergencies, people are at higher risk of undernutrition 
and micronutrient deficiencies. Those whose nutrition was poor before 
the crisis are even more vulnerable. Acute malnutrition weakens the 
immune system, which then becomes more susceptible to developing 
diseases that can be fatal.

Undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies can be 
widespread among refugees and displaced people, as adequate food and 
health services are often not readily accessible.

Inadequate nutrition and repeated bouts of infection during 
the first 1000 days of a child’s life can cause stunting, which has 
irreversible long-term effects on the physical and mental development of
 children. Worldwide in 2015, there were 156 million stunted children, 
about 45% of them living in fragile and conflict-affected countries.Emergencies can also aggravate diet-related noncommunicable 
disease, such as heart disease, high blood pressure (hypertension), 
diabetes and cancer. Healthy foods may not be regularly available and 
appropriate medical care may not be accessible, leading to the 
interruption or cessation of treatments for these diseases. Given that 
many populations have high levels of noncommunicable diseases, 
emergencies can cause a significant increase in illness and even death 
from these diseases."
Who is most vulnerable to undernutrition and starvation during emergencies?,"Young children and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are
 most vulnerable to undernutrition. Their bodies have a greater need for
 nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, and are more susceptible to 
the harmful consequences of deficiencies.

Children are at the highest risk of dying from starvation. 
They become undernourished faster than adults. Severely wasted children 
are 11 times more likely to die than those with a healthy weight. 
Undernourished children catch infections more easily and have a harder 
time recovering because their immune systems are impaired. Globally, 
undernutrition is an underlying factor in more than half of child deaths
 from pneumonia and malaria, and more than 40% of measles deaths."
How should severe acute malnutrition be treated in an emergency?,"Severe acute malnutrition is when a person is extremely thin 
and at risk of dying. They need immediate treatment. The response to 
acute malnutrition is broad and includes several elements such as 
medical, food, water and hygiene, and social services.


Children who still have an appetite can stay at home and 
receive outpatient care. They need treatment with specially-formulated 
foods, and their recovery must be monitored regularly by a trained 
health worker.
Children who have medical problems and do not have an appetite
 need inpatient care in a clinic or hospital. They need 
specially-formulated milks and treatment for infections or other 
potential complications."
Why is it so important for infants to breastfeed during emergencies?,"Breastfeeding can be life-saving for young children in emergencies.

Breastfeeding in all environments has major health benefits 
for both children and mothers. Breast milk gives infants all the 
nutrients they need for healthy growth and development. It is readily 
available and contains antibodies that protect infants from common 
childhood illnesses. Breastfeeding also reduces mothers’ risks of breast
 and ovarian cancer, type II diabetes, and postpartum depression. Breastfeeding becomes even more critical for child survival in
 humanitarian emergencies. Young children in emergencies face higher 
risks of diarrhoea, pneumonia and undernutrition. Lack of food, unsafe 
water, poor sanitation, overcrowding and overburdened health systems put
 infants and young children at greater risk. 

WHO recommends that all babies should be fed only breast milk 
for the first 6 months, after which they should continue breastfeeding 
(as well as eating other foods) until 2 years of age, and potentially 
for longer, even in emergency situations."
What are the challenges to breastfeeding in emergency situations?,"Often the poor physical and mental health of mothers in 
emergencies leads to poor breastfeeding outcomes. Displaced mothers may 
struggle to find comfortable, private places to breastfeed and their 
support network of family and friends is often not accessible in 
emergencies. Health workers who would usually offer support may be 
redeployed to cope with other aspects of the emergency response. 

Well-meaning donors may distribute breast-milk substitutes 
(such as infant formula) in emergencies. This can undermine 
breastfeeding and, if there is a lack of clean water to make formula or 
clean bottles and teats, put children at increased risk of infections 
which can be deadly.Governments and humanitarian organizations have a key role to 
play in protecting, promoting and supporting breastfeeding in 
emergencies."
What is malnutrition?,"Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and/or nutrients. The term malnutrition covers 2 broad groups of conditions. One is ‘undernutrition’—which includes stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), underweight (low weight for age) and micronutrient deficiencies or insufficiencies (a lack of important vitamins and minerals). The other is overweight, obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer).


At a health centre in South Sudan a health workers helps a mother  weigh her child to check on the child’s nutrition levels."
What are the consequences of malnutrition?,"Malnutrition affects people in every country. Around 1.9 billion adults worldwide are overweight, while 462 million are underweight. An estimated 41 million children under the age of 5 years are overweight or obese, while some 159 million are stunted and 50 million are wasted. Adding to this burden are the 528 million or 29% of women of reproductive age around the world affected by anaemia, for which approximately half would be amenable to iron supplementation.Many families cannot afford or access enough nutritious foods like fresh fruit and vegetables, legumes, meat, and milk, while foods and drinks high in fat, sugar, and salt are cheaper and more readily available, leading to a rapid rise in the number of children and adults who are overweight and obese, in poor as well as rich countries. It is quite common to find undernutrition and overweight within the same community, household or even individual – it is possible to be both overweight and micronutrient deficient, for example."
What is being done to address malnutrition?,"In April 2016, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution proclaiming the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition from 2016 to 2025. The Decade aims to catalyse policy commitments that result in measurable action to address all forms of malnutrition. The aim is to ensure all people have access to healthier and more sustainable diets to eradicate all forms of malnutrition worldwide."
What is a Phase 3 clinical trial?,"Clinical trials are a critical source of data for decisions around the development of vaccines, drugs and other medical interventions. They are carried out in several phases.Phase 1: Researchers test a new intervention in a small group of people for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects.Phase 2: The intervention is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective, to further evaluate its safety and eventually to select optimal dosages.Phase 3: The intervention is given to larger numbers of the target group of people to confirm it works (i.e. the efficacy of the intervention), monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely.Phase 4: Studies are done after the intervention has been marketed to gather information on the drug's effectiveness in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use."
"Where was the Phase 3 clinical trial for RTS,S conducted?","The Phase 3 trial of RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) was conducted over 5 years (2009–2014) in 7 sub-Saharan African countries: Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and the United Republic of Tanzania. The trial sites within these countries represented a range of malaria transmission settings (low, medium and high)."
Who were the target age groups?,"The Phase 3 trial enrolled approximately 15 500 infants and young children. There were 2 target age groups:Older children received their first dose of the malaria vaccine between 5 and 17 months of age.Infants received the vaccine together with other routine childhood vaccines at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age."
What were the vaccine efficacy trial results?,"Children aged 5–17 monthsAmong children aged 5–17 months who received three doses of RTS,S administered at 1-month intervals, followed by a fourth dose 18 months later, the vaccine reduced malaria by 39%, equivalent to preventing nearly 4 in 10 malaria cases. In addition, the 4-dose vaccine schedule reduced severe malaria by 31.5% in this age group, with reductions also seen in malaria hospitalizations, all-cause hospitalizations and the need for blood transfusions. Among children aged 5–17 months who did not receive a fourth dose of the vaccine, the protective benefit against severe malaria was lost, highlighting the importance of the fourth dose of this vaccine to maximise its benefits.InfantsAmong the younger infants, the malaria vaccine did not work sufficiently well to justify its further use in this age group."
Why did vaccine efficacy vary between the 2 target age groups?,"Lower immune responses are induced by the RTS,S vaccine in infants aged 6–12 weeks compared to children aged 5–17 months. Possible factors underlying this difference include interference by co-administration with DTP-containing vaccines, the presence of maternally acquired antibodies to malaria in this age group, and immaturity of the immune system in the 6–12 week olds compared to the 5–17 month age group."
What were the safety results for the vaccine?,"In the Phase 3 trial, the vaccine was generally well tolerated, with adverse reactions similar to those of other childhood vaccines. Among children in the older age group, there was an increased risk of febrile seizures within 7 days after any of the vaccine doses. Among the younger infants, this risk was only apparent after the fourth dose. There were no long-lasting consequences due to any of the febrile seizures.Among children in the older age group, a modest increase in the number of cases of meningitis and cerebral malaria was found in the group receiving the malaria vaccine compared to the control group. It is unclear whether there is a causal link between these findings and the RTS,S vaccinations; this will be further monitored in the pilot implementation programme. This observation was not seen in infants aged 6–12 weeks.The European Medicines Agency found RTS,S to have an acceptable safety profile. As with other new vaccines, and in line with national regulations, the safety profile of RTS,S will continue to be monitored as the vaccine is made available."
What is an EMA scientific opinion based on Article 58?,"The European Medicines Agency (EMA) provides a regulatory procedure (Article 58) to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of a medicine or vaccine that is intended for use only outside the European Union (EU) and to issue a scientific opinion on the benefit-risk ratio of the product. The assessment uses the same standards and procedures as for medicines marketed in the EU. National regulators may use the EMA’s scientific opinion to support their own regulatory review to reach a decision on licensure."
"What is the EMA scientific opinion on RTS,S?","In July 2015, the EMA issued a “European scientific opinion” on RTS,S. The opinion indicated that, in EMA’s assessment, the quality of the vaccine and its risk-benefit profile was favorable from a regulatory perspective. EMA’s opinion did not consider contextual elements such as the feasibility of implementation, the value of the vaccine in the context of other malaria control measures, and the likely cost-effectiveness of the intervention in different settings. RTS,S is expected to be approved for use in the context of the pilots by the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) in each of the three countries participating in the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme."
"What are the WHO recommendations related to RTS,S?","In October 2015, WHO jointly convened the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC) to review all evidence regarding RTS,S relevant for global policy. SAGE/MPAC recommended that pilot implementation of RTS,S occur in 3–5 settings in sub-Saharan Africa, administering 3 doses of the vaccine to children beginning as close to 5 months of age as possible and a fourth dose 15–18 months after the third dose. SAGE and MPAC were not supportive of vaccine use among infants aged 6–12 weeks due to the lower efficacy seen in this age group.SAGE/MPAC recommended large-scale implementation pilots, to evaluate the extent to which the protection demonstrated in children aged 5–17 months in the Phase 3 trial can be replicated in the context of the routine health system, particularly in view of the need for a 4-dose schedule that requires new immunization contacts.The pilot implementation should also assess the extent to which RTS,S vaccination impacts mortality, which could not be adequately assessed in the Phase 3 trial due to the very low overall mortality in the trial setting, and whether the excess cases of meningitis and cerebral malaria, identified during the Phase 3 trial, are causally related to RTS,S vaccination or not. The pilot implementation programme will generate critical evidence in 3–5 years’ time to enable decision-making about the potential wider scale use of this vaccine.WHO officially adopted the SAGE/MPAC recommendations in January 2016 and is strongly supportive of the need to proceed with these pilots as the next step for the RTS,S malaria vaccine.WHO position paper on malaria vaccinepdf, 536kb"
What is insecticide resistance?,"Insecticide resistance refers to changes in an insect that increase its ability to withstand or overcome the effects of one or more insecticides. When the frequency of resistant insects in a population increases (e.g. through resistance traits being passed on from one generation to another), the efficacy of an insecticidal intervention can be compromised. Increased frequency of resistant insects may be detected through assays that measure insect mortality in response to a particular insecticide, or through genetic tests that detect resistance mechanisms in individual insects.In malaria control, the insecticides currently recommended for use against the potential parasite-carrying adult Anopheles mosquitoes belong to five classes: carbamates, organochlorines, organophosphates, pyrethroids and neonicotinoids. These insecticides are commonly deployed through the core malaria interventions of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS).The potential result of mosquito resistance to insecticides is that the insects are not killed when they come into contact with a standard dose of an insecticide deployed through ITNs or IRS. However, this does not mean that these interventions will be ineffective immediately, or that there will be a surge in malaria cases. For example, when mosquitoes are resistant to pyrethroids, ITNs still provide protection for the people using them."
When was insecticide resistance first identified?,"Insecticide resistance is not a new phenomenon; it has been an undesired side-effect of malaria vector control since insecticides first came into broad use in the 1940s. Malaria-endemic countries should be aware of the importance of detecting and preventing the development and spread of insecticide resistance. Increasingly, countries are including insecticide-resistance monitoring and management practices in their national malaria control strategies.However, in most endemic countries – particularly in sub-Saharan Africa – control strategies focus on scaling up vector-control interventions. Only limited resources are made available to build capacity for entomological monitoring and insecticide susceptibility testing, and to design and implement strategies to manage insecticide resistance.The main factor driving the emergence and spread of resistance during the past decade has been the heavy reliance on a single class of insecticides – pyrethroids – for both public health and agriculture purposes. Pyrethroids are highly effective and safe. They are the least expensive of the 5 classes of insecticides used in malaria vector control, and are the only class available for use on ITNs. In some areas, the use of pyrethroids and similar insecticides in agriculture appears to have contributed to the development of resistance in mosquitoes.Currently, ITNs appear to remain effective in countries with malaria transmission although there is evidence emerging from some areas that resistance can reduce the impact of pyrethroid IRS. To sustain the remarkable gains in malaria control and move towards malaria elimination, urgent action is required to prevent the further development of resistance and maintain the effectiveness of vector-control interventions."
How many countries currently have evidence of insecticide resistance?,"Since 2010, a total of 68 countries have reported resistance to at least one class of insecticide, with 57 of those countries reporting resistance to two or more classes. Widespread resistance to pyrethroids has been reported for malaria vectors from numerous countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well as central and south-east Asia.Recent data are considered the most relevant because insecticide resistance can vary over time in response to a range of factors, and can also differ greatly over short distances. However, not all countries with ongoing malaria transmission undertake routine resistance monitoring, and when monitoring is done, it often fails to include all insecticide classes, main malaria vectors or eco-epidemiological zones. In addition, there are critical issues with the national management and timely sharing of resistance data. Our understanding of the scale of insecticide resistance is therefore incomplete. As routine monitoring is scaled up, a more detailed picture will emerge about the state of insecticide resistance.A global database on insecticide resistance was established in 2014 to provide timely tracking of changing insecticide-resistance patterns and to identify where data are lacking. The data have also been made available through the online Malaria Threats Map. Such databases can assist endemic countries and their partners to take targeted action. WHO provides updates on the number of countries monitoring and detecting insecticide resistance in the annual World malaria report.Guidelines for malaria vector controlGlobal report on insecticide resistance in malaria vectors: 2010–2016"
What is the GPIRM and how has it been developed?,"he WHO Global plan for insecticide resistance management in malaria vectors (GPIRM) was released in May 2012 as a call to action to tackle the threat of insecticide resistance. It was developed in response to a request in 2011 by the World Health Assembly and the Board of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership which reflected the collective belief that a global strategy was needed to serve as the foundation of a coordinated multi-stakeholder response.The GPIRM was developed through a broad-based consultation with over 130 stakeholders. These stakeholders represented all constituencies of the malaria community, including malaria-endemic countries, multilateral agencies, development partners, academia and industry. The plan included the latest available evidence on the extent of insecticide resistance around the world, and put forward a strategy for global and country levels, identifying clear roles and timelines for all stakeholders.Through the GPIRM, WHO and the Roll Back Malaria Partnership urge governments of malaria-endemic countries and their partners to implement a five-pillar strategy to tackle the growing threat of insecticide resistance, including to facilitate the development of innovative tools and strategies for vector control.Global plan for insecticide resistance management in malaria vectors"
What are the solutions put forward by the GPIRM?,"The GPIRM is based on 5 pillars that address actions spanning the short, medium and long term. It requires coordinated action from all stakeholders, including national malaria control programmes and national regulatory authorities, WHO, donors and other multilateral organizations, research institutions and partners in the public health insecticide industry. The strategy calls on stakeholders to:plan and implement insecticide-resistance management (IRM) strategies in malaria-endemic countries;ensure capacity for proper, timely entomological monitoring and effective data management;develop new, innovative vector-control tools;fill knowledge gaps on the mechanisms of insecticide resistance and the impact of current approaches to IRM; andensure that key enabling mechanisms – including advocacy, and human and financial resources – are in place.Malaria-endemic countries are encouraged to modify their vector-control programmes to address insecticide resistance. The starting point is to analyse the state of insecticide resistance and to design a comprehensive IRM strategy. To support this, WHO produced a Framework for national plan for monitoring and management of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors. Countries should strive to have pre-emptive IRM strategies in place and integrate related costs into national budgets for malaria control.Framework for a national plan for monitoring and management of insecticide resistance in malaria vectorsIn parallel, all endemic countries should build capacity to collect, handle and interpret data on resistance, and leverage that information for making decisions about vector control. Through IRM, endemic countries can delay the evolution of resistance, preserve the effectiveness of existing insecticides, and even reverse resistance in some settings. Successful implementation of the GPIRM will require coordinated action between all partners in the malaria control community as well as other sectors, such as agriculture and finance."
What are the implications of insecticide resistance for LLIN and IRS effectiveness?,"All types of ITNs currently recommended by WHO are treated with pyrethroids. During the past decade, vector control has relied heavily on pyrethroids, and countries have now reported widespread resistance to insecticides of this class. Nevertheless, there are few proven cases in which insecticide resistance has been linked to decreased effectiveness of ITNs or increases in malaria cases.In 2016, WHO reported on the findings of a large, multi-country evaluation to assess the impact of insecticide resistance on malaria vector control interventions – primarily long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). The 5-year evaluation found that people who slept under LLINs in the evaluation areas had significantly lower rates of malaria infection than those who did not use a net, even though mosquitoes showed resistance to pyrethroids in all of these areas.This study reaffirms the WHO recommendation of universal LLIN coverage for all populations at risk of malaria. Even in areas where resistance has been identified, countries should continue to scale up or maintain universal coverage with LLINs as:LLINs act as a physical barrier against parasite-carrying mosquitoes; andeven a sublethal effect of the insecticide on mosquitoes is likely to contribute to malaria control.IRS using non-pyrethroid insecticides may also be implemented in areas with LLINs, for resistance management purposes. Larval source management may provide an opportunity for IRM, because there is greater diversity in larvicides including biological formulations, and habitat modification or manipulation can reduce overall dependence on insecticides.However, interventions targeting the larval and pupal stages of mosquitoes are appropriate only in certain settings, where mosquito aquatic habitats are few, fixed and findable. With continued reliance on LLINs and IRS, the operational impact of their use must be monitored closely, and resistance should be tested at sentinel sites at least once a year and more often if feasible."
What progress has been made in implementing the GPIRM since its release in 2012?,"According to the World malaria report 2018, 40 countries have completed their insecticide resistance monitoring and management plans, in line with the GPIRM. WHO continues to work with governments of endemic countries, donor organizations, United Nations agencies, and research and industry partners to implement the 5-pillar strategy contained in the GPIRM; this includes ongoing support for the development of new and innovative vector-control tools and strategies.Urgent efforts are required to ensure the correct use of existing interventions and the availability of new tools to maintain the effectiveness of malaria vector control."
What is artemisinin and how is it used for the treatment of malaria?,"Isolated from the plant Artemisia annua, or sweet wormwood, artemisinin and its derivatives are powerful medicines known for their ability to swiftly reduce the number of Plasmodium parasites in the blood of patients with malaria.Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are recommended by WHO as the first-and second-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria as well as for chloroquine-resistant P. vivax malaria. ACTs combine an artemisinin derivative (artemisinin derivatives include artesunate, artemether and dihydroartemisinin) with a partner drug. The role of the artemisinin compound is to reduce the number of parasites during the first 3 days of treatment (reduction of parasite biomass), while the role of the partner drug is to eliminate the remaining parasites (cure).WHO currently recommends 5 different ACTs*. In areas where other ACTs are failing, the use of artesunate-pyronaridine, a new ACT which has received a positive scientific opinion from the European Medicines Agency, may be considered.** Two injectable treatments, artesunate or artemether, are recommended for the treatment of severe malaria and should be followed by an ACT when the patient can tolerate oral therapy.Increased access to ACTs in malaria-endemic countries has been integral to the remarkable success in reducing the global malaria burden over the last 15 years. An estimated 2.74 billion treatment courses of ACT were procured by countries over the period 2010–2017. An estimated 62% of these procurements were reported to have been made for the public sector.* Artesunate-amodiaquine; artesunate-mefloquine; artesunate+sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine; artemether-lumefantrine; dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine.** Through a regulatory procedure known as Article 58, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines that are intended exclusively for use outside the European Union."
What is the definition of “artemisinin resistance”?,"Artemisinin resistance typically refers to a delay in the clearance of malaria parasites from the bloodstream following treatment with an ACT. As a result, the artemisinin compound is less effective in clearing all parasites within a 3-day period among patients who are infected with artemisinin-resistant strains of malaria.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the mechanisms of resistance developed by the parasites against artemisinin compounds affect only one stage of the malaria parasite cycle in humans: the ring stage. It is, thus, more appropriate to call the delayed clearance “partial resistance”, to highlight this time-limited and cycle-specific feature. It is unknown whether partial artemisinin resistance could further evolve to affect other stages of the parasites, developing into complete resistance.

Currently, even if patients are infected with artemisinin-resistant parasites, nearly all patients treated with an ACT are fully cured provided that the partner drug is highly efficacious in that geographical area. In the absence of partner drug resistance, artemisinin partial resistance rarely leads to treatment failure. Furthermore, there is no evidence that artemisinin partial resistance alone has resulted in an increase in malaria morbidity and mortality in the GMS. Nevertheless, the proportion of treatment failures increase when both resistance to artemisinin and to ACT partner drugs are present, compared to resistance to the partner drug alone."
What is the state of partial artemisinin resistance around the world?,"Artemisinin partial resistance likely emerged prior to 2001, and prior to the widespread deployment of ACTs in the GMS. To date, it has been confirmed in 5 countries of the GMS: Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam.In late 2013, researchers identified a new molecular marker: mutations in the Kelch 13 (K13) propeller domain were shown to be associated with delayed parasite clearance in vitro and in vivo. The molecular marker allows for a more precise mapping and monitoring of the geographical distribution of resistance. It could also be a mechanism for retrospective mapping of resistance in a large number of settings.Parasites carrying mutations in the K13 propeller domain have been reported in all 5 GMS countries listed above as well as in Guyana, where studies are ongoing to evaluate impact of this mutation on delayed clearance and ACT efficacy and its potential spread within and outside South America.Molecular studies have shown that partial artemisinin resistance has emerged independently in several locations in the GMS and spread within the subregion. The K13 mutation identified in South America has also emerged independently. Additionally, recent in vitro and molecular studies have shown the emergence of partial artemisinin resistance in Rwanda; importantly, the drug-resistant parasites have emerged independently and have not spread to Africa from South-East Asia. Partial artemisinin resistance has occurred as a consequence of several factors: poor treatment practices, inadequate patient adherence to prescribed antimalarial regimens, and the widespread availability of oral artemisinin-based monotherapies and substandard forms of the drug."
What is the current state of ACT failures around the world?,"Artemisinin resistance alone rarely leads to treatment failure. However, resistance of malaria parasites to ACT partner drugs can lead to treatment failure (regardless of the presence of artemisinin partial resistance). As a consequence, several ACTs are failing in the Greater Mekong an area where both artemisinin and ACT partner drug resistance have been identified.

The geographic scope of the problem could widen quickly and have important public health consequences: the spread or independent emergence of partner drug resistance or multidrug resistance globally could pose a public health threat, as no alternative antimalarial medicine is available at present with the same level of efficacy and tolerability as ACTs.

The efficacy of WHO-recommended ACTs is assessed through therapeutic efficacy studies (TES). Such studies at regular intervals at the same sites allow for the early detection of declines in drug efficacy, providing evidence for guiding national malaria treatment policies."
How is WHO supporting countries in their efforts to tackle multidrug resistance including partial artemisinin resistance and ACT partner drug resistance?,"WHO is working with national malaria programmes, research institutions, and other partners – within and outside of the GMS – to map the presence of artemisinin partial resistance and partner drug resistance; the latter is equally important in view of the consequences seen in terms of ACT treatment failures.TES remain the primary tool for monitoring the efficacy of nationally recommended antimalarial treatments in all countries. Molecular markers are an asset for early warning signals, or to investigate whether ACT treatment failures were to the result of resistance. To improve the response to multidrug resistance in the GMS, countries, with the support of WHO and partners, continually collect and analyse quality data at sentinel sites across the subregion.Reducing the prevalence of malaria in the GMS – with the ultimate goal of elimination – will mitigate the risk of the spread of multidrug resistant parasites outside the GMS. In collaboration with national malaria programmes and partners, WHO led the development of the Strategy for malaria elimination in the Greater Mekong Subregion (2015–2030). Urging immediate action, the strategy calls for the elimination of all species of human malaria across the GMS by 2030, with priority action targeted to areas where multidrug-resistant malaria parasites have been identified.Strategy for malaria elimination in the Greater Mekong Subregion (2015–2030)With technical guidance from WHO, all GMS countries have developed national malaria elimination plans. As countries implement these plans, WHO is providing ongoing technical support through its 5 GMS country offices, regional offices in New Delhi and Manila, and the Organization’s Geneva headquarters.In 2017, WHO launched the Mekong Malaria Elimination (MME) programme. The MME subregional team in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, supports the GMS malaria elimination strategy by facilitating coordination and dialogue among partners, communicating with external stakeholders, and coordinating cross-border initiatives.Urgent action now will deliver significant savings in the long run, improving the sustainability and public health impact of malaria interventions around the world."
Who is funding these efforts?,"The fight to eliminate malaria in the GMS is supported through generous contributions from a number of donors, including: the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund), the UK Department for International Development and the US Agency for International Development. In response to the emergence of partial artemisinin resistance in the GMS, the Global Fund launched the Regional Artemisinin-resistance Initiative (RAI) in 2013. Funding provided through this initiative has enabled countries to purchase and distribute commodities such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), rapid diagnostic tests and quality-assured drugs. In 2017, the Global Fund announced an expansion of the RAI (RAI2E), committing an additional US$ 242 million for the period 2018 to 2020. WHO is working with GMS countries and the Global Fund to optimize the use of this funding in the subregion."
What more needs to be done to address this threat?,"Scaling up prevention and control interventions and implementing all of WHO’s recommendations require considerable financial resources, long-term political commitment, and strong cross-border cooperation. Endemic countries outside the GMS – and, in particular, in the WHO African Region, where malaria took an estimated 404 500 lives in 2017 – need to also identify additional resources to prevent the emergence and spread of partial artemisinin and partner drug resistance. One of the most urgent challenges is to strengthen pharmaceutical market regulation, and remove oral artemisinin-based monotherapies and substandard medicines from markets around the world once and for all."
Why has WHO launched a new framework for malaria elimination?,"The malaria landscape has changed significantly since the first framework for malaria elimination was released in 2007. Over the last 10 years, funding has increased, access to core malaria interventions has improved, new tools and strategies have been
    developed, and the malaria burden has dramatically decreased, putting more countries on the path to elimination.In May 2015, the World Health Assembly adopted a new Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016–2030, a landmark document that
    sets ambitious new goals for the malaria community. All of these advances have led to new global guidance and policy recommendations by WHO, which are reflected in the new WHO Framework for malaria elimination."
What are some of the key changes in the new framework?,"2007 framework was intended for countries with low to moderate malaria transmission, and provided guidance for countries to assess whether or not malaria elimination was a feasible goal. But this concept of feasibility created a dichotomy that is no longer seen as useful: we think that every country can achieve elimination.While it is true that elimination is a longer-term goal for countries with a high malaria burden, it is still the ultimate end goal. Instead of asking if a country can achieve elimination, the new framework outlines the critical requirements needed to achieve and maintain elimination at every level of malaria transmission intensity in every endemic country."
The new framework uses a malaria transmission continuum to guide programmatic decision-making. Can you explain how this works?,"Malaria transmission can vary widely within a country. To be effective, programmes must select strategies and tools that are appropriate for the malaria situation in a targeted geographic area. The new framework facilitates this planning by identifying recommended programmatic actions along the continuum of malaria transmission, from high transmission to very low.Areas with high malaria transmission intensity, for example, should focus on scaling up vector control and universal access to diagnosis and treatment, while strengthening surveillance systems as they go. In areas where transmission is very low, elimination activities can be accelerated and additional new methods can be applied. When an area is very close to having zero malaria cases, any cases that do occur should be investigated to clear remaining areas of infection."
What else is new?,"Our framework is now aligned with the three pillars of the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016–2030: ensuring universal access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment; accelerating efforts towards elimination and attainment of malaria-free status; and transforming malaria surveillance into a core intervention. Surveillance in particular plays a key role in the fight against malaria, and this is highlighted throughout the document. Elimination cannot be achieved without quality surveillance systems.Other updates include an overview of the requirements for achieving and maintaining elimination, such as national surveillance systems, quality data management, and robust human and financial resources."
Can you talk a little bit about changes to the process for WHO certification of malaria elimination?,"There is a new, streamlined process for WHO certification of malaria elimination, which occurs after a country has had three years without a locally transmitted case of malaria. We’ve also introduced the concept of subnational elimination, which is particularly relevant for large countries like China, Mexico, and Brazil. The framework offers guidance on setting targets and systems to verify malaria-free areas within a country’s borders, which can be an important building block for future national certification. This will help countries document and motivate progress."
Who is this framework intended for?,"This framework is primarily intended for malaria programme managers to inform the development of national strategic plans for malaria elimination. It’s important to mention that this is a framework, not a prescriptive document. The recommended actions and interventions can and should be adapted according to national and sub-national needs."
What has changed in the world since the first framework was issued in 2007?,"Several countries and regions have eliminated malaria, including Sri Lanka, Maldives, Kyrgyzstan, and the European region. WHO has now recognized an additional 21 countries that are on track to reduce malaria transmission to zero by 2020, and is supporting these countries to reach this target. Even high burden countries have started thinking about elimination. It’s a good trend, and helps put us on the right track to achieving global elimination of the disease."
"What is RTS,S/AS01?","RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) is a vaccine that acts against Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest malaria parasite globally and the most prevalent in Africa.* In January 2016, the vaccine was recommended by
    WHO for pilot introduction in selected areas of 3 African countries. RTS,S is being evaluated for use as a complementary malaria control tool that could be added to (and not replace) the core package of WHO-recommended preventive, diagnostic and treatment
    measures. * The vaccine offers no protection against P. vivax malaria, which predominates in many countries outside of Africa."
"What makes RTS,S different from malaria vaccine candidates currently under development?","RTS,S is the first, and to date, the only vaccine that has demonstrated it can significantly reduce malaria, and life-threatening severe malaria, in young African children.Beginning in 2019, 3 sub-Saharan African countries – Ghana, Kenya and Malawi – led the introduction of the vaccine in selected areas of moderate-to-high malaria transmission as part of a large-scale pilot programme coordinated by WHO. The aim is to vaccinate about 360 000 children per year in the selected areas across the 3 countries. Vaccinations are being provided through each country’s routine immunization programme."
"What is the efficacy of the RTS,S vaccine?","The Phase 3 trial, conducted over 5 years (from 2009 to 2014), enrolled approximately 15 000 young children and infants in 7 sub-Saharan African countries.* The trial sites within these countries represented a range of malaria transmission settings.Among children aged 5–17 months who received 4 doses of RTS,S, the vaccine prevented approximately 4 in 10 (39%) cases of malaria over 4 years of follow-up and about 3 in 10 (29%) cases of severe malaria, ** with significant reductions also seen in overall hospital admissions as well as in admissions due to malaria or severe anaemia. The vaccine also reduced the need for blood transfusions, which are required to treat life-threatening malaria anaemia by 29%. * These countries included: Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, and the United Republic of Tanzania. ** Severe malaria refers to those cases where the initial infection with the malaria parasite evolves into an acute, life-threatening illness."
"What is WHO’s official position on RTS,S?","In October 2015, after a thorough review of the Phase 3 trial results, 2 independent WHO advisory groups – the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC) – jointly called for pilot implementation of the vaccine in 3 to 5 settings in sub-Saharan Africa.In a position paper published on 29 January 2016, WHO officially adopted the joint recommendation of SAGE and MPAC; in doing so, the Organization recognized the public health potential of the RTS,S vaccine while also acknowledging the need for further evaluation before considering wide-scale deployment. There is currently no WHO policy recommendation for the large-scale use of the RTS,S malaria vaccine beyond the pilot programme."
What is the purpose of the malaria vaccine implementation programme?,"The efficacy of the RTS,S vaccine was established in the Phase 3 clinical trial (see #3, above); children who received 4 doses of the vaccine had a significantly lower risk of developing malaria, including severe malaria. The malaria vaccine implementation programme (MVIP), coordinated by WHO, was designed to address several outstanding questions related to the public health use of the vaccine.Specifically, the MVIP will assess the feasibility of administering the recommended 4 doses of the vaccine in children; the vaccine’s potential role in reducing childhood deaths; and its safety in the context of routine use. Data and information derived from the pilot will inform a WHO policy recommendation on the broader use of the vaccine.The evaluation protocols have been reviewed and approved by the WHO Ethical Review Committee, and by the institutional or national ethical review committees in each of the pilot countries."
Which countries will participate in MVIP?,"Three countries – Ghana, Malawi and Kenya – are participating in the MVIP. Each of these countries selected the areas to be included in the pilot programme."
What were the criteria for country selection?,"In December 2015, WHO issued a call for expressions of interest from African ministries of health to collaborate in the malaria vaccine implementation programme. Of the 10 countries that responded positively, 3 were selected for the programme based on pre-specified criteria. Key among these was the expressed desire by the ministry of health to engage in the MVIP, and well-functioning malaria and immunization programmes.Other criteria included: good coverage of recommended malaria control interventions and childhood vaccinations; moderate-to-high malaria transmission despite good implementation of WHO-recommended malaria interventions; a sufficient number of young children living in the malaria-transmission areas where the vaccine will be introduced; strong implementation research or evaluation experience in the country; and capacity to assess safety outcomes. Participation in the Phase 3 RTS,S trial was an additional criterion considered during the country selection process."
"Within the pilot areas, which districts will receive the vaccine first?","It is important at this stage to learn how best to introduce the malaria vaccine into routine immunization systems, and to evaluate that introduction. To do this, some districts/sub-counties within the selected areas will have the opportunity to introduce the vaccine into their immunization schedules at the start of the programme, while other districts will not receive the vaccine until a later date, should there be a WHO recommendation for wider use. Assignment of areas into those that receive the vaccine and those that do not has been through a process called “randomization”, based on chance using a computer programme.Introducing the vaccine into some areas, while delaying it in others, is also important for understanding the public health usefulness of the vaccine and will provide key information on whether the vaccine should be introduced throughout the pilot countries and more broadly across Africa."
Who is eligible for vaccination?,"The vaccine is being delivered by the ministries of health as part of the Expanded Programme on Immunizations (EPI). Children who present to health facilities for vaccination in the pilot areas of the 3 African countries will be able to receive the vaccine as part of their routine immunizations, in selected areas of Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. Approximately 360 000 children per year across the 3 pilot countries will receive the RTS,S vaccine. Some areas selected for participation in the MVIP will serve as comparator areas in which the vaccine will not be available initially.Immunization authorities in the 3 countries have specified the vaccination schedule, based on WHO recommendations. In Malawi, the vaccine is first offered at 5 months of age, while in Ghana and Kenya, the vaccine is first offered at 6 months of age. A 4-dose schedule is recommended, with the first 3 doses provided at approximately monthly intervals and the fourth dose near the child’s second birthday."
How do families get the information they need to decide on whether or not to vaccinate their child with the malaria vaccine?,"As with other vaccines provided to children in routine vaccination settings, the EPI programmes in the pilot countries inform caregivers and communities about the new vaccine before and throughout its introduction. For RTS,S, this includes information about the benefits and risks of the vaccine, at what age a child is eligible for vaccination, the recommended 4-dose vaccination schedule, what to expect following vaccination, and the importance of continuing other malaria control measures (such as using insecticide-treated bed nets). Communities are also told that the vaccine is being provided as part of a pilot introduction.Information is provided one on one by health workers, through health talks led by health officials and health providers – using flip charts, informational leaflets and posters – as well as meetings with community leaders, community health volunteers, public service announcements, and through the local health media, among other methods. Parents who bring their children to clinics for vaccination do so with the option to vaccinate their children or not, as with other vaccines.The vaccine is being delivered through EPI programmes as part of routine delivery, and similar to how other childhood vaccines are offered to families. Because it is not an experimental vaccine, but approved by the regulatory authorities, written consent is not sought for individuals who are vaccinated."
When did the vaccinations begin?,"Vaccinations began in the 3 pilot countries in 2019: in Malawi on 23 April, in Ghana on 30 April, and in Kenya on 13 September."
Is the vaccine safe?,"In the Phase 3 trial, the vaccine was generally well tolerated, with adverse reactions similar to those of other childhood vaccines.A stringent regulatory authority – the European Medicines Agency – issued a positive scientific opinion of the vaccine in July 2015, concluding that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks. As with other new vaccines, and in line with national regulations, the safety profile for RTS,S will continue to be monitored. Any safety signals that arose in the clinical testing phase will be monitored closely as the vaccine is introduced more widely.During the Phase 3 trial of the RTS,S vaccine, there were more cases of meningitis in children who received the vaccine than in those who did not; however, no causal link to the vaccine has been established.Overall, there were 29% fewer cases of severe malaria in children who received the vaccine. In those children who did develop severe malaria, there were more cases of cerebral malaria, one type of severe malaria; however, no causal link to the vaccine has been established.Finally, a post-hoc analysis identified an imbalance in female mortality in the phase 3 trial. This was considered by the national regulators and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The EMA concluded that there is insufficient information to classify the finding as a “potential risk” (a formal EMA classification) and that this was likely to be a chance finding, but one that should be monitored during vaccine introduction."
Are there any known side effects?,"Known side effects include pain and swelling at the injection site, and fever. These side effects are similar to reactions observed with other vaccines given to children. The vaccine is associated with an increased risk of febrile seizures within 7 days of the administration. In the Phase 3 trial, children who had febrile seizures after vaccination recovered completely and there were no long-lasting consequences."
Who developed and who manufactures the vaccine?,"GSK led the development of RTS,S over a 30-year period. In 2001, GSK began collaborating with PATH’s Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) to continue developing RTS,S. A 5-year Phase 3 efficacy and safety trial was conducted between 2009 and 2014 through a partnership that involved GSK, MVI (with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation), and a network of African research centres at 11 sites in 7 countries. GSK is the vaccine manufacturer."
"What is the purpose of the Phase 4 studies, and how do they relate to the MVIP?","As part of the malaria vaccine implementation programme, GSK is conducting a number of Phase 4 studies in parts of the pilot areas. These studies – as required and standard for a new vaccine – will gather additional information on the vaccine’s effectiveness and on any side effects associated with routine use. Data collected through the Phase 4 studies will complement data from the pilot evaluations led by WHO."
Which partners are involved in MVIP?,"The malaria vaccine implementation programme is coordinated by WHO in close collaboration with ministries of health in participating countries and a range of in-country and international partners.Ministries of health in each country are delivering the malaria vaccine through their national immunization programmes in the selected areas. National malaria control programmes are ensuring that existing WHO-recommended prevention tools, such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), continue to be deployed on a wide scale.WHO is working with PATH and GSK on the vaccine pilot programme through a collaboration agreement. PATH provides technical and project management support and is leading studies on health care utilization and the economics of vaccine implementation. GSK is donating up to 10 million doses of RTS,S vaccine for use in the pilot and is leading additional studies to continue monitoring the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness in routine use. UNICEF is supporting the forecasting and deployment of the donated RTS,S vaccine to pilot countries.In-country research partners are leading the evaluation of the RTS,S vaccine pilot implementation. This includes a consortium of partners in each pilot country led by the Kintampo Health Research Centre in Ghana; the CDC Foundation in Kenya; and the University of Malawi College of Medicine in Malawi. Health utilization studies are being led by the University of Health and Allied Services in Ghana; the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in Kenya; and the Malawi-Liverpool Wellcome Trust in Malawi.Pilot evaluation and health utilization study partners in each country are the following:Ghana: Kintampo Health Research Centre; Navrongo Health Research Centre; Research and Development Division of Ghana Health Service; University of Ghana School of Public Health; Malaria Research Centre, Agogo Presbyterian Hospital; University of Health and Allied Services; Noguchi Memorial Institute of Medical Research; and, the University of Health and Allied Sciences.Kenya: the CDC Foundation (the National Foundation for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Inc.); The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme; the U.S. Army Research Directorate-Kenya; the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI); and, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.Malawi: the University of Malawi College of Medicine; the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme; and, the University of North Carolina Project Malawi."
"What are the terms of the collaboration agreement between WHO, PATH and GSK?","The collaboration agreement between WHO, PATH and GSK defines the roles and responsibilities of these 3 partners for the MVIP. Specifically:WHO is responsible for programme oversight and coordination of all aspects of the malaria vaccine pilot programme; this includes rigorous evaluations of the feasibility of implementing the 4-dose vaccination schedule, and the vaccine’s impact and safety in the context of routine immunization. WHO also provides technical assistance to the Ministries of Health in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi as the countries introduce the vaccine in selected areas through their national immunization programmes.PATH provides technical and project management support to the programme and is leading studies on health care utilization and the economics of vaccine implementation.GSK is donating up to 10 million doses of RTS,S for use in the pilot programme. GSK is also leading Phase 4 studies to continue to monitor vaccine safety and effectiveness in routine use, as is required and standard for a new vaccine.The partners are also exploring how best to assure the longer-term supply of the vaccine, should there be a WHO policy recommendation for wider use of the vaccine."
Who is funding the MVIP?,"In November 2016, WHO announced     funding commitments for the pilot programme through 2020 by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and Unitaid. In 2019, the trio of global health funding bodies committed additional funding to complete the pilot programme through 2023."
What is the expected duration of the programme?,"The programme is expected to continue through 2023. The pilot will generate data on the feasibility of delivering the vaccine in childhood vaccination clinics, the vaccine’s potential role in reducing childhood deaths and its safety in the context of routine use. Results will inform future decisions on the potential wider-scale deployment of the vaccine."
"Why is the MVIP being rolled out only in Africa, and not in other regions?","The WHO African region bears the greatest burden of malaria worldwide. Young children are especially vulnerable: in 2018 alone, malaria claimed the lives of approximately 265 000 African children under the age of 5.*Over the last 2 decades, African countries have made tremendous progress in the fight against malaria using core WHO-recommended tools such as insecticide-treated mosquito nets, indoor spraying with insecticides and antimalarial medicines. However, in some areas where these approaches have been adopted, malaria illness and death remain stubbornly high. New and complementary tools are needed to further drive down the disease burden, with a view to ultimately achieving the vision of a world free of malaria.Most malaria illness and death in the African region are caused by the parasite targeted by the RTS,S vaccine (P. falciparum). The vaccine was developed specifically for African children who are at highest risk of dying of malaria. Additional studies will be needed before the vaccine can be recommended for use outside Africa. * In 2018, children under 5 accounted for two thirds (67%) of global malaria deaths, the vast majority of which (approximately 265 000) were African children. Globally, there were an estimated 405 000 deaths from malaria in 2018."
What other interventions exist for malaria control?,"Existing WHO-recommended interventions for malaria control include: LLINs, indoor residual spraying with insecticides, preventive treatment for infants and during pregnancy, and prompt diagnostic testing and treatment of confirmed cases with effective anti-malarial medicines. In the Sahel, a sub-Saharan region of Africa, seasonal malaria chemoprevention is recommended in areas with highly seasonal malaria transmission. Deployment of these tools has already dramatically lowered the malaria disease burden in many African settings. The disease burden can be further lowered through the continued scale-up of these existing control measures.While efforts to sustain and further expand existing interventions must continue, new complementary tools and strategies are needed in some areas to accelerate the fight against malaria and further drive down the disease burden. The malaria vaccine is proposed as a potential additional tool to complement the existing package of WHO-recommended preventive, diagnostic and treatment measures for malaria."
"Is RTS,S licensed by a regulatory authority?","Following a joint review convened by the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum (AVAREF) in May 2018, the National Regulatory Authorities of Ghana, Kenya and Malawi authorized the RTS,S vaccine for use in the pilot areas.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) carried out a scientific assessment of RTS,S and issued a “European scientific opinion” on the vaccine in July 2015. This opinion was given as part of the EMA’s cooperation with WHO, whereby EMA provides opinions on medicines that are not intended for use in the European Union but are needed to prevent or treat diseases of major public health importance around the world. The EMA found that the quality of the vaccine and its risk-benefit profile are favorable from a regulatory perspective.EMA’s opinion did not consider contextual elements such as the feasibility of implementation, the value of the vaccine in the context of other malaria control measures, and the likely cost-effectiveness of the intervention in different settings."
Why did WHO establish a Strategic Advisory Group on malaria eradication (SAGme)?,"In 2016, at the request of the former Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, WHO established a Strategic Advisory Group to tackle
    the big question of malaria eradication, a topic that sparks passions, opinions, excitement and concerns. Dr Chan felt that WHO should have a position on eradication and that it should be based on a thorough and authoritative study rooted in a deep analysis of past and future malaria trends. The group, made up of scientists and public health experts from around the world, came together to advise WHO on what malaria might look like in the future as well as the feasibility of eradication."
What is WHO’s current position on malaria eradication?,"Remember that WHO embraced the goal of malaria eradication soon after it was founded in 1948. In 1955, a first Global Malaria Eradication Programme (GMEP) was launched. This commitment to eradication was reaffirmed in a World Health Assembly resolution
    of 1969, and later reinforced in 2015 through the Assembly’s endorsement of the Global technical strategy for malaria 2016-2030 (GTS).
 It clearly spells out the vision of a malaria-free world."
What were the group’s main findings about malaria eradication?,"The key finding is that a malaria-free world would mean millions of lives saved and a return on investment of billions of dollars.Global megatrends related to climate, urbanisation, agricultural use patterns, electrification mean that malaria will be radically reduced in many areas but remain entrenched in others.Yet even with our most positive projections, if we use our current tools to fight malaria, we will still have 11 million cases of malaria in Africa in 2050. No one can formulate a precise and reliable plan for the eradication of human malaria nor calculate what it will cost. SAGme concluded that, especially with the stalling of process over the past 2 years, we must get the world back on track to meet the GTS targets. To do this, we need a renewed drive towards research and development, including on malaria vaccines and other approaches and tools.We also need political leaders to ensure everyone has access to affordable health care. And we must invest in robust and agile surveillance systems to detect changes in malaria transmission so that we can better target the response. Eradication is still the global vision."
What is the difference between elimination and eradication?,"This definition has changed over the years. Currently, we call elimination the interruption of transmission in a given geographical area; usually we refer to a country. Eradication means that all countries have eliminated malaria and there is complete
    interruption of malaria transmission globally, with zero cases across the globe."
"Does WHO’s advisory group think that malaria can be truly eradicated, as is the case with smallpox?","The answer is yes. There is no specific biological or environmental barrier to malaria eradication. However, do we have the tools, programmes and financing that could actually drive an eradication effort now? The answer is no.  A successful eradication effort will require tools that we don’t have today. This speaks to the critical importance of an accelerated research and development agenda."
Why is it taking so long to eradicate malaria?,"We are fighting a very complex parasite - one that can be transmitted by certain mosquito vectors very efficiently. Malaria roots itself in the heartland of Africa and affects some of the harder-to-reach and more impoverished populations. To date, the disease has received insufficient attention in the research and development space, and insufficient investment to roll out available tools, particularly in countries with weak health systems."
What is the WHO doing now to fight malaria in areas hardest hit by malaria?,"WHO and the RBM Partnership to End Malaria are driving the country-led High burden to high impact (HBHI) approach.
 It will initially focus on getting the 11 highest burden counties - 10 of which are in Africa - back on track to achieve the GTS targets for 2025.By taking this approach, countries will enable real impact in the fight against malaria. The concrete outcomes we are aiming for include more resources freed up by political leaders, better use of information, stronger technical guidance and a more coordinated
    response to malaria. We will roll out the HBHI approach to all malarious countries in Africa as we progress towards a malaria-free continent."
Some experts think that we should have a target date for the malaria eradication goal as we do for some other public health goals. Why can’t we work towards a target date to eradicate malaria?,"If we consider smallpox, the burden of the disease was relatively low when WHO launched an eradication campaign in 1967. At the time, we had a highly efficacious vaccine and could actually foresee an end date.  When the polio eradication campaign was launched in 1988, there were an estimated 330 000 cases of the disease and we had a highly effective vaccine. The campaign originally had a 12 or 15-year timeline. However, 30 years later, despite massive progress,
    the job has still not been completed.  In the case of malaria, we have more than 200 million cases annually, and we don’t have optimal tools. The SAGme believes that setting a date now, when there are so many uncertainties, may actually be counterproductive. Instead, the group is calling
    for an accelerated effort to achieve the already-approved targets of the GTS, a framework that includes 5-year targets for reductions in malaria cases and deaths through 2030.  Following this alternative approach will actually take us along the path towards eradication. We can assess our progress at five-year intervals and eventually determine the tipping point -- when a time-limited, credible, achievable campaign to fully eradicate
    malaria could be launched. We are clearly not there yet."
What is the E-2020 initiative?,"In May 2015, the World Health Assembly endorsed a new Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030, setting ambitious goals aimed at dramatically lowering the global malaria burden over this 15-year period, with milestones along the way to track progress. A key milestone for 2020 is the elimination of malaria in at least 10 countries that had the disease in 2015. To meet this target, countries must report zero indigenous cases in 2020.
According to a WHO analysis published in 2016, 21 countries have the potential to eliminate malaria by 2020. They were selected based on an analysis that looked at the likelihood of elimination across 3 key criteria:

trends in malaria case incidence between 2000 and 2014;
declared malaria objectives of affected countries; and
informed opinions of WHO experts in the field.

Together, these 21 malaria-eliminating countries are part of a concerted effort known as the E-2020 initiative, supported by WHO and other partners, to eliminate malaria in an ambitious but technically feasible time frame."
"If the global response to malaria is at a crossroads, why are we seeing some countries accelerate towards elimination?","Globally, progress in the malaria response has stalled: the declining trend in malaria cases and deaths has levelled off and even reversed in some regions. However, as highlighted in the World malaria report 2018, 46 countries reported less than 10 000 malaria cases in 2017, compared to just 37 countries in 2010.
This bright spot in the response shows that elimination of the disease is possible and that global efforts to control and prevent malaria have resulted in substantial declines in malaria cases and deaths. Now, it is important to focus on continuing to support both groups of countries: those with a high burden of malaria and those accelerating towards elimination."
Argentina and Uzbekistan have eliminated malaria: why are they not featured in the E-2020 report?,"The E-2020 report is focused on progress among 21 malaria-eliminating countries that were identified by WHO in 2016 as having the potential to eliminate the disease by 2020. At the time of the initiative’s development, Argentina and Uzbekistan were
    already too advanced in the elimination process to be included in the E-2020 group.Both countries have reported zero indigenous cases of malaria since 2011. Uzbekistan was officially certified malaria-free
    by WHO in December 2018 and Argentina attained this status in May 2019."
"Once a country achieves malaria elimination, does this mean there is no longer any need to focus on the disease?","The malaria elimination journey does not end with certification. Preventing re-establishment of malaria requires keeping robust technical capabilities and skilled know-how in place.The malaria elimination journey does not end with certification. Preventing re-establishment of malaria requires keeping robust technical capabilities and skilled know-how in place. In practical terms, this means maintaining up-to-date malaria surveillance
    systems and ensuring health workers at all levels, in both public and private sectors, are continuously trained on how to detect malaria and the procedures for diagnosis, notification, treatment and patient follow up – critical components to
    prevent the disease from coming back."
"For countries with a high burden of malaria, is elimination of the disease a possibility?","Yes. While elimination is undoubtedly a longer-term goal, it is the ultimate objective that all malaria-endemic countries should aim for. To support countries on the path towards elimination, the WHO Global Technical Strategy outlines the critical requirements needed to achieve and maintain elimination at every level of malaria transmission intensity in every endemic country, focusing on the need for:

country ownership,
tailored responses,
strengthened surveillance,
equity in access to health services, and
innovation in malaria control tools."
What is leishmaniasis?,"Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by any species of Leishmania parasite. It is transmitted by the bite of an infected female sandfly. In most cases, a person who is infected by the parasite has neither symptoms nor signs of infection and is not considered to have leishmaniasis. Although there are some 20 different parasites that cause the disease, there are only three different types of leishmaniasis.The most common type (CL) causes skin lesions, mainly nodules or painless ulcers. The second type (VL, also known as kala-azar) is a life-threatening disease that causes anaemia (deficiency in the number or quality of red blood cells), fever, enlarged liver, enlarged spleen and significant weight loss. VL is invariably fatal if left untreated. The third type (MCL, or mucosal leishmaniasis alone) destroys the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat cavities and surrounding tissues."
How are Leishmania parasites transmitted?,"Leishmania parasites are transmitted by the bite of a tiny –2–3 mm long – female insect vector, the phlebotomine sandfly. There are some 800 known phlebotomine species, but only about 30 have been found to transmit Leishmania parasites. Only female sandflies can transmit the parasites; they need blood for their eggs to develop and become infected with Leishmania when they suck blood from an infected person or animal. Over a period of 4–25 days, the parasites develop in the sandfly. When the infectious female sandfly then feeds on a fresh source of blood, it inoculates the person or animal with the parasite, and the transmission cycle is completed.Phlebotomine sandflies are found throughout the intertropical and temperate regions of the world. The female sandfly lays its eggs in the burrows of certain rodents, the bark of old trees, ruins, cracks in the walls of houses, animal shelters and household rubbish, where the larvae can find the organic matter, heat and humidity they need to develop. In its search for blood (usually in the evening and at night), the female sandfly can cover a distance of up to several hundred metres around its habitat."
Why is leishmaniasis important?,"The different types of leishmaniasis last months or years, causing stigmatization, stress, mutilation, weakness, prostration or eventual death if treatment is not available, depending on the causative parasite and the underlying condition of the patient. Since the disease can start as a mild, slowly progressing condition, it may take a long time before patients seek medical care or before they are diagnosed by a health practitioner who may not be familiar with the disease or where there are no appropriate health services close to where patients reside.Leishmaniasis is closely linked to poverty. Factors that increase the risk of infection include poor housing conditions and environmental sanitation, lack of personal protective measures, and economically driven migration and employment that bring nonimmune people into contact with infected sandflies. Poverty is associated with poor nutrition and other infectious diseases, which increase the risk of an infected person progressing to clinical manifestations of the disease.Diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis are expensive when they are not offered free of charge in the public sector. Consequently, families must sell their assets and take loans to pay for care, leading to further impoverishment and reinforcing the vicious cycle of disease and poverty. Public investment in leishmaniasis would decrease the burden of the disease and alleviate poverty."
How long does it take for leishmaniasis to develop after being infected?,"For VL, the incubation period (i.e. the duration between infection and the first symptom or sign) is generally 2–6 months, but it can be longer or shorter in people with compromised immune systems who visit endemic areas.For CL, the incubation period between the bite of an infected sandfly and the development of lesions may range from 2 weeks to 6 months.For PKDL, it usually appear 6 months to 1 or more years after apparent cure of VL, but it may occur earlier or concurrently with VL in certain settings."
What are the signs and symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and PKDL?,"VL, or kala-azar, is the most severe form of leishmaniasis. The main signs are prolonged irregular bouts of fever, enlarged spleen and/or loss of weight. Other signs and symptoms include anaemia, enlarged liver, cough, diarrhoea and enlarged lymph nodes. These signs and symptoms, alone or in combination, lack specificity and mimic those of malaria, malnutrition, typhoid, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis and other systemic diseases. Signs of malnutrition manifest with the progression of disease, with intercurrent[1] infections. In areas co‐endemic for malaria, kala-azar should be suspected when fever lasts for 2 weeks or longer and no response has been observed with antimalarial medicines (assuming that drug‐resistant malaria has been ruled out).  PKDL is characterized by patchy and raised hypopigmented rashes. It mainly occurs in areas endemic for L. donovani in East Africa and South Asia. Late manifestations are plaques, papules or nodular and infiltrative lesions, especially on the face. Most PKDL cases occur in patients previously treated for VL. The macules are often confused with vitiligo or leprosy.[1] Infection that occurs during, and modifies the course of, another disease."
What are the signs and symptoms of cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis?,"CL is the most common form of leishmaniasis. The clinical spectrum is very broad and varies between and within endemic regions and depends upon several factors including parasite species or immunological status or type of zoonotic cycle involved. Classically, a typical lesion starts as a papule or nodule at the site of inoculation of the bite of the infected sandfly that grows slowly to develop a painless ulcer with surrounding induration. Lesions may not heal and require specific treatment, or spontaneously heal gradually over months or years, often resulting in a disfiguring scar with altered pigmentation. Lesions lack specificity and closely resemble many skin conditions such as cutaneous tuberculosis, fungal infection, impetigo, leprosy, psoriasis, tropical ulcer, venous leg ulcers, verruca or zona.MCL lesions can lead to partial or total destruction of the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat cavities and surrounding tissues. Some patients have mucosal lesions without cutaneous involvement."
How is leishmaniasis diagnosed?,"The different forms of leishmaniasis can be diagnosed by various methods depending upon the type of health facility and the health care setting. These methods include serological tests or microscopic demonstration of parasites, culture or PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Parasite identification remains the gold standard of diagnosis.In areas endemic for VL, the disease can be diagnosed at primary health care level or in rural district hospitals using the rK39-based rapid diagnostic test, which produces results in less than 30 minutes.For PKDL, diagnosis is generally clinical and can be confirmed by skin smears or skin biopsies.CL is usually diagnosed clinically in highly endemic areas where only one type of infection exists. It is mandatory to obtain a parasitological confirmation of the diagnosis before engaging in a systemic, potentially highly toxic antileishmanial treatment. The same procedure is recommended before engaging in a local treatment."
What is the treatment against leishmaniasis?,"The various clinical forms of leishmaniasis are either life‐threatening (if untreated) or disfiguring in a proportion of patients. Therefore, confirmation of disease is important before initiating treatment. Several factors determine the choice of therapy, such as clinical form of leishmaniasis, parasite species, endemic region, health service setting, drug policy in endemic countries, availability of antileishmanial medicines, other morbid conditions and individual benefit–risk ratio of medicines. In certain cases, supportive treatment such as nutritional supplementation or rehydration blood transfusion may be required before starting therapy. Wherever possible, cases should be managed under medical supervision.VL is a life-threatening condition, and the aim of the treatment is to cure the patient, reduce the risk of relapse and reduce transmission of resistant parasites. Similarly, for CL, therapeutic interventions include a range of options such as topical, systemic and nonpharmacological treatments."
Why are the number of cases reported lower than the number of cases estimated?,"Underreporting of leishmaniasis varies from country to country and among regions.Several factors have an impact on the accuracy of official data versus the actual burden of disease. Patients who are affected by minor or mild forms of the disease, such as some types of small self-healing lesions, do not seek medical attention.In other circumstances, the long distances between the place of residence and the health facility, or the lack of adequate equipment in some health facilities to diagnose or treat the disease, prevent patients from seeking medical attention. Frequently, surveillance systems in many countries are not configured to capture neglected tropical diseases such as leishmaniasis or the system does not perform well."
What can I do to prevent infection?,"The only way to prevent infection is to avoid being bitten by an infected female sandfly carrying the parasite. Practically, this can be difficult in real field conditions. Although there are a number of measures that could minimize the chances of being bitten, such as sleeping under an impregnated bed net or spraying the walls of houses, not all sandflies have the same resting and biting habits, and these vector behaviours pose a challenge to effective prevention.Some sandflies are indoors while others are outdoors, and their biting preferences for humans or other mammals affect the chances of being bitten in a given geographical area.There is no vaccination or preventive medicine against the disease."
What are the control strategies for leishmaniasis?,"Control of leishmaniasis depends on several factors, including local epidemiology of disease, geographical areas, transmission habitats, knowledge of parasite and vector species involved, presence or absence of animal reservoirs, ecology of the area, presence of other vector-borne diseases and social contexts, for example population displacement, rapid urbanization and deforestation.Generally, control strategies include early detection and treatment of cases, control of reservoir hosts, vector control, environmental management and improvement in social determinants of risk factors."
What is Legionnaires’ disease?,"Legionnaires' disease is caused by exposure to a bacterium 
that is found in water and soil. It ranges in severity from a mild 
influenza-like illness to a serious and sometimes fatal form of 
pneumonia. Symptoms include fever, headache, lethargy, muscle pain, diarrhoea and sometimes coughing up blood.The disease can be treated with antibiotics."
Who is most at risk?,"Most people exposed to the legionella bacterium do not get sick and the disease does not spread directly between humans.Most people who do get sick are aged over 50 years. People 
with weak immune systems, chronic illnesses, smokers and those with a 
history of heavy drinking are at highest risk.Outbreaks are often linked to poorly maintained air conditioning and water systems, humidifiers and whirlpool spas."
Where does the disease occur?,"Legionnaires’ disease occurs worldwide but the rate of 
occurrence is unknown as many countries lack good surveillance systems 
to diagnose and detect the disease.In Australia, Europe and the United States of America, there are about 10-15 cases detected per million population."
How can it be prevented?,"The public health threat of Legionnaires’ disease can be 
reduced by regular maintenance, cleaning and disinfection of water and 
air conditioning systems to minimize the growth of the legionella 
bacterium. There is no vaccine currently available for Legionnaire’s disease.More information:Fact sheet on Legionellosis (updated June 2016)"
What are the International Health Regulations?,"The International Health Regulations (2005), or IHR (2005), represents a binding international legal agreement involving 196 countries across the globe, including all the Member States of WHO. Their aim is to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide. The purpose and scope of the IHR (2005) is to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade."
How does the IHR Emergency Committee work?,"The Emergency Committee is made up of international experts who provide technical advice to the WHO Director-General in the context of a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) The Committee provides views on:whether the event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC);the Temporary Recommendations that should be taken by the country experiencing an emergency of international concern, or by other countries, to prevent or reduce the international spread of disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international trade and travel; andthe termination of a PHEIC.The Director-General makes the final determination of a PHEIC and Temporary Recommendations to address the situation, based on advice from the Emergency Committee, information provided by the State Parties, scientific experts and an assessment of risk to human health, risk of international spread of disease and of risk of interference with international travel.Under the IHR (2005), Temporary Recommendations automatically expire three months after their issuance. Emergency Committees are therefore reconvened at least every 3 months to review the current epidemiological situation and to review whether the event continues to be a public health emergency of international concern and whether changes need to be made to the Temporary Recommendations. A statement of the Emergency Committee meeting is published on the WHO website after each meeting of the Committee."
What is a public health emergency of international concern?,"A PHEIC is defined in the IHR (2005) as, “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response”. This definition implies a situation that is:serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected;carries implications for public health beyond the affected State’s national border; andmay require immediate international action."
Who are the members of an IHR Emergency Committee?,"Members of an IHR Emergency Committee are drawn from the IHR Experts Roster, established by the Director-General, and, where appropriate, from other WHO expert advisory panels. The IHR Expert Roster is composed of international experts in fields such as disease control, virology, vaccine development or infectious disease epidemiology.Members can be selected on the basis of expertise required for any particular session. At least 1 member of the Emergency Committee should be an expert nominated by a State Party within whose territory the event arises. These States Parties are invited to present their views to the Emergency Committee. The Director-General may also appoint 1 or more technical experts to advise the Committee, on his or her own initiative or at the request of the Committee.Persons who are neither members of the IHR Experts Roster nor other WHO Expert Advisory Panels could be appointed as technical experts to advise the Committee, but not as members of the Committee.The names of members and advisers to an IHR Emergency Committee, their job titles and any other information that could be determined to be a potential conflict of interest are published on WHO’s website."
How are the members of an IHR Emergency Committee chosen?,"Selection of members is based primarily on their technical ability and experience in the relevant fields of expertise. The Director-General aims to ensure that members of the IHR Emergency Committee have the broadest possible geographical representation and reflect diverse knowledge, practical experience and approaches. Achieving gender balance is also a desirable aim.Members of WHO advisory panels and committees do not receive any remuneration from the Organization."
How are people appointed to the expert advisory panels?,"A member of an expert advisory panel is an expert appointed by the DG.An expert advisory panel may be established by the DG in any field, as and when required by the development of the Organization’s programme.Any person possessing qualifications and/or experience relevant and useful to the activities of the Organization in a field covered by an established expert advisory panel may be considered for appointment as a member of that panel – after consultations with the national authorities concerned."
What lessons does influenza preparedness offer for tackling respiratory pathogens and other diseases?,"Capacity building for influenza is critical because if you can prepare for and respond to flu outbreaks or respiratory events, you learn and practice for responses to other emerging diseases.Flu is not a sporadic outbreak like Ebola or Zika. It is always there, so there is always something to practice with and keep skills sharp. Because flu is a continual threat there is a lot of learning that goes on which also supports work on other emerging diseases. It’s like the basic architecture for capacity building in all areas. For example, you can practice your communications for responding to outbreaks and better understand the behavioral aspects of vaccine hesitancy. You can build your laboratory capacity and surveillance and response capacity and use it for other things infectious threats such as MERS or SARS or other respiratory threats. Influenza can also help you learn how to implement a vaccine programme and introduce new drugs. All these things, if you put them in place for flu, will help build capacity for a broad spectrum of outbreaks."
"Can you give an example of a country that established an influenza-monitoring programme, which was then used for other diseases?","In Africa, when we started in 2006, there were only about five countries that had capacity to monitor influenza and process flu samples. Now, in the last ten years, after we started building capacity, there are about 25 countries that routinely conduct flu work. When the 2009 pandemic came, many of them were ready to diagnose the first cases through their newly established flu surveillance programmes.We also embarked on a global rapid response-training programme where we trained more than 100 countries, including many in Africa. Later we heard that they were using the flu outbreak response teams in their response to Rift Valley Fever, to Ebola, and other outbreaks.

There are still places we can improve surveillance, in Africa, in central Asia. There are little pockets everywhere."
Is there a long-term plan to help the world prepare for influenza?,"WHO and partners are developing a “Global Strategy for Influenza” to be launched in 2018. In accordance with the WHO’s Thirteen 13th Global Programme of Work (GPW13), which draws on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and efforts to strengthen health systems to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC), the new strategy will support WHO Member States in developing seasonal influenza prevention and control capacities. These efforts, in turn, will build greater preparedness for the next pandemic. The strategy focuses on three priorities, strengthening pandemic preparedness, expanding seasonal influenza prevention and control and research and innovation.  Research and innovation includes improved modelling and forecasting of influenza outbreaks, along with the development of new vaccines, including a possible universal influenza vaccine that would work against all influenza virus strains."
What is H5N1?,"H5N1 is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza (or ""bird flu""). Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60%."
How does H5N1 influenza spread to people?,"Almost all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. The virus does not infect humans easily, and spread from person to person appears to be unusual. There is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly prepared and thoroughly cooked food."
Why is there so much concern about H5N1 influenza?,"H5N1 infection in humans can cause severe disease and has a high mortality rate. If the H5N1 virus were to change and become easily transmissible from person to person while retaining its capacity to cause severe disease, the consequences for public health could be very serious."
Why might the H5N1 influenza virus change?,"Influenza viruses constantly undergo genetic changes. It would be a cause for concern, should the H5N1 virus become more easily transmissible among humans."
What are the symptoms of H5N1 avian influenza in humans?,"The symptoms of H5N1 infection may include fever (often high fever, > 38°C) and malaise, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches. Other early symptoms may include abdominal pain, chest pain and diarrhoea. The infection may progress quickly to severe respiratory illness (for example, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, pneumonia, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) and neurologic changes (altered mental status or seizures)."
"Is it safe to eat chicken, poultry products and other wild game birds?","Yes, it is safe to eat properly prepared and cooked poultry and game birds. The virus is sensitive to heat. Normal temperatures used for cooking (so that food reaches 70°C in all parts) will kill the virus. As a standard precaution, WHO recommends that poultry, poultry products and wild game birds should always be prepared following good hygienic practices, and that poultry meat should be properly cooked.To date, a large number of human infections with the H5N1 virus have been linked to the home slaughter and subsequent handling of diseased or dead birds prior to cooking. These practices represent the highest risk of human infection and are the most important to avoid."
How is H5N1 avian influenza in humans treated?,"In most cases, avian influenza in humans develops into a serious disease that should be treated promptly in the hospital and may require intensive care, where available. The antiviral medicine oseltamivir can reduce the severity of illness and prevent death, and should be used in all cases."
Is a vaccine available to prevent human infection with H5N1avian influenza?,"Candidate vaccines to prevent H5N1 infection have been developed, but they are not ready for widespread use."
Does seasonal influenza (seasonal flu) vaccination provide protection against H5N1 viruses?,Seasonal influenza vaccination does not appear to protect against H5N1 infection.
What is the WHO response to H5N1 influenza?,"WHO is working with countries to help them detect and manage cases of H5N1 infection in humans when they occur.WHO collaborates with global health partners and agencies, including the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), to control and prevent the spread of animal diseases.WHO’s global laboratory system, the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), identifies and monitors strains of circulating influenza viruses, and provides advice to countries on their risk to human health and available treatment or control measures."
How significant is the problem of infections in health care across the world?,"Health care-associated infections occur worldwide and affect 
hundreds of millions of patients both in developed and developing 
countries. Lack of reliable and standardized surveillance data suggests a
 significant underestimation of the real burden of disease.


		The risk of acquiring health care-associated infections is 
universal and can be found every health-care facility and system around 
the world. Health-care workers are often the channel for the spread of 
such infections to other patients in their care. It should also be noted
 that many patients may carry microbes without any obvious signs or 
symptoms of an infection."
Why is hand hygiene still low after all the efforts to promote in recent years?,"In recent years many parts of the world have seen major 
improvements in hand hygiene. However, there is still not enough access 
to clean water, not enough sinks or towels, not enough awareness of the 
central role played by hand hygiene, and not enough investment in a 
multifaceted approach to tackle the abysmally low levels of compliance.Whatever the reasons, even in resource-rich settings, 
compliance can be as low as 0%, with compliance levels most frequently 
well below 40%."
CD4+T-Cell counting technology,"What are CD4 T-cells?CD4+ T-cells are also known as helper T-cells and act as an co-ordinator of the immune response, unfortunately, CD4+ T-cells are also the main targets of HIV. HIV destroys infected CD4+ T-cells and leading to an overall weakening of the immune system.What is the CD4+ T-cell count?Lower numbers of circulating CD4+ T-cells indicates a weakening of the immune system and advancement in the progression of HIV disease. The CD4+ T-cell count can also be indicative of the success or failure of anti-retroviral therapy (ARV).How are CD4+ T-cells enumerated?CD4+ T-cell counts are performed using manual and automated methods.ManualMicroscopyOptical or fluorescence microscopyRequires a centrifuge and other laboratory consumables e.g. beadsDesigned for low sample throughput laboratories in resource-limited settingsCurrently marketed products include; Cyto-Spheres [Coulter Corporation, USA] and Dynabeads® [Dynal Biotech, Norway]Automated SystemsFlow CytometeryGold Standard for accuracy, precision, reproducibilityExpensive and technically demanding, requiring extensive technician trainingCapable of high sample throughput in well-resourced laboratoryCan be used for other laboratory applicationsRequires regular equipment maintenanceDedicated CytometerCytometer used exclusively to perform CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell enumerationSimpler and cheaper than flow cytometers but lacking in general laboratory versatilityCurrently marketed products include; FACSCount™ [Becton Dickinson, USA]"
Viral load testing,"What is HIV-1 viral load?HIV-1 viral load refers to the number of viral particles found in each millilitre. The more HIV-1 viral particles in the blood, the faster the CD4+ T-cells are likely destroyed and the faster the progress toward AIDS.How are CD4+ T-cell counts and HIV viral load used?CD4+ T-cell counts are used, together with the Viral Load test, to get a complete picture about how the immune system is fighting the virus. As HIV reproduces within the body, the viral load increases and HIV destroys the CD4+ T-cells and thus lowers the amount of cells present. Generally, the higher the HIV viral load, the more CD4+ T-cells are being destroyed. The goals are to keep CD4+ T-cell count high and viral load low.The number of CD4+ T-cells and virus levels will guide a patient and their doctor in deciding when to start anti-viral treatment.Monitoring CD4+ T-cell counts and viral loads during treatment helps the doctor assess how well the patient responds to their prescribed treatment.How is Viral Load measured?The viral load test should consistently detect and measure virus levels down to 50 copies/mL, have a high specificity and provide reproducible results. The technologies used are advanced and very sensitive for measuring the amount of HIV genetic material present in the blood."
ELISA tests,"What is an ELISA test?Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs) are the most widely used type of assay. They have evolved from viral lysate tests to tests containing recombinant protein and synthetic peptide antigens:They have high sensitivity and specificity.ELISAs are designed specifically for screening large numbers of specimens at a time, making them suitable for use in surveillance and centralized blood transfusion services.As ELISAs require sophisticated equipment and skilled technicians to perform the tests, their use is limited to certain circumstances."
Simple/Rapid tests,"What is a Simple/Rapid test?Simple/Rapid tests are designed for use where a preliminary screening test result is required and are especially useful in resource-limited countriesHigh quality, easy-to-use tests for use in resource poor settings.Tests based on agglutination, immuno-dot, immuno-chromatographic and/or immuno-filtration techniques.Quick and easy to perform – 10 minutes to 2 hours – and require little or no additional equipment.Are designed for use with individual or a limited number of samples, which make them more economical then ELISAs in low throughput laboratories.Possibility to store at room temperature for extended period of time.Same-day results provide timely treatment interventions.What is the difference between a ELISA and a Simple/Rapid testELISAs are highly sensitive and specific, and are able to detect HIV-1/ HIV-2 and variants. They require sophisticated equipment that must be regularly maintained, a constant electricity supply and skilled technicians. They are really not suitable for small laboratories, but for testing large numbers of samples per day, as well as in blood banks or for surveillance studies. The Simple/Rapid tests are better for emergency testing, and in smaller laboratories with low numbers of tests per day."
Confirmatory assays,"What is a confirmatory assay?Confirmatory Assays are used to confirm whether specimens found reactive with a particular screening test contain antibodies specific to the virus they have been tested for.Expensive tests, first generation tests have proven to be prone to producing large numbers of indeterminate results.LIAs ( Line immune-assays ) have been developed which in general produce fewer indeterminate results.Studies have shown that combinations of ELISAs or Simple/Rapid assays can provide results as reliable as the confirmatory assays at a much lower cost."
Window period,"What is the ""window-period"" and how long is it?This is the time between original infection with HIV and the appearance of Detectable antibodies to the virus, normally a period of about 14-21 days."
"Alternative specimens- whole blood, oral fluid & urine","Is urine or saliva feasible to use as a source of HIV detection?Tests are currently available for anti-HIV testing using urine and saliva specimens. However, the level of antibodies in these specimen types is lower than serum or plasma. Therefore, rigourous sample collection conditions, testing procedures, result validation and interpreation must be followed."
What is the role of WHO in crises?,"The primary objective in an emergency, whether natural or man-made, is to reduce avoidable loss of life and the burden of disease and disability.Every day, hundreds of millions of people face threats to health and livelihoods because local and national systems that support their health and lives are overwhelmed or too weak to withstand crises and extreme events.WHO is committed to working better with Member States and other stakeholders so that suffering and death in crises are minimized and systems are protected and repaired. We want to help national authorities and communities to:Prepare for crises by strengthening their overall capacity to manage all types of crises;Mitigate against the effects of crises by taking measures to reduce the effects of disasters and crises on systems that support good public health;Respond to crises by ensuring effective, efficient and timely action to address public health priorities so that lives are saved and suffering is reduced;Recover from crises by ensuring that the local health system is back to functioning.During crises, humanitarian health partners, led by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Health Custer under the leadership of WHO will empower humanitarian country teams to better address the health aspects and crises.At all levels of WHO, whether it be in Country Offices, Regional Offices, and headquarters, the WHO network for Emergency Risk Management and Humanitarian Response serves as a convener and conduit. It provides information and services, and mobilizes partners to agree on standards and courses of action."
Where is it possible to find information on WHO in crises?,The easiest way to find information is to consult the web page www.who.int/disasters.The regional office web pages are another important source of information.Regional Office for Africa: (http://www.afro.who.int)Regional Office for the Americas: (http://www.paho.org)Regional Office for South-East Asia: (http://www.searo.who.int)Regional Office for Europe: (http://www.euro.who.int)Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean: (http://www.emro.who.int)Regional Office for the Western Pacific: (http://www.wpro.who.int)All of the Regional Office web pages are linked to the Humanitarian Health Action website.
What is the Humanitarian Reform and how does it affect WHO’s work?,"The reform process, started in 2005 with the Humanitarian Response Review, represents a considerable change in the international scene and has vast implications for the work of WHO. The Humanitarian Reform is underpinned by three pillars:Improving the predictability of funding through the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF);Coordinating effective response through the Cluster Approach, andStrengthening the Humanitarian Coordinator System.The three pillars of humanitarian reform are secured by a foundation of strong and collaborative partnerships.Strengthening commitment to coordination at the field level by all humanitarian partners is another pillar of the humanitarian reform process. The IASC self-assessment of the cluster roll-out brought to the fore that humanitarian coordination operations are very much related to the success of inter-cluster relations and efficient cluster roll-out. The two agendas converge. WHO chairs the IASC Humanitarian Coordinators Training Core Group set up to fill an existing gap and improve the ability of the Emergency Relief Coordinator to propose for HC position individuals whose skills, performance and background meet the expectations of leadership and experience of the IASC."
What is the Health Cluster?,"When emergencies occur, coordination is necessary. No one organization can respond to a health crisis alone. The Global Health Cluster is a platform for organizations to work in partnership to ensure collective action results in more timely, effective and predictable response to health emergencies. WHO is the Cluster Lead Agency.There are over 900 partners at country level of which 56 partners engage strategically at global level. Currently there are 30 Health Clusters/Sectors, of which 2 are regional coordination mechanisms. These Health Clusters are working to meet the health needs of approximately 68 million people worldwide.The Global Health Cluster exists to support Health Clusters countries, and it can make a difference by: providing the right expertise at the right place at the right time; building the capacity of Health Cluster Coordinators; gathering and disseminating sound and relevant information to guide partners’ response; identifying and addressing gaps in technical knowledge and available guidance to ensure the health response follows global best practices and standards; and, promoting and advocating for the importance of humanitarian health action on the global stage, to help ensure that Health Clusters receive the political and financial support they need.The cluster approach was developed by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee as part of the humanitarian reform in 2005, to increase the effectiveness of humanitarian response by building partnerships. Clusters are groups of humanitarian organizations, both UN and non-UN, in each of the main sectors of humanitarian action (e.g. water, health and logistics) with clear responsibilities for coordination. The aim of the cluster approach is to strengthen system-wide preparedness and technical capacity to respond to humanitarian emergencies by ensuring that there is predictable leadership and by enhancing the accountability and transparency of humanitarian response.For more information visit the Health Cluster web site"
What is the impact of the Central Emergency Response Fund on WHO’s work?,"The CERF is a United Nations emergency relief fund officially launched on 9 March 2006 by the Secretary-General. In December 2006, pledges to the CERF totalled US$345 million. The objective of the CERF is to provide urgent and effective humanitarian aid to regions threatened by, or experiencing, a humanitarian crisis, and UN agencies and their partners can access the funds within the crucial first 72 hours of a crisis.The CERF has immediately become an essential funding mechanism of WHO’s emergency work. In 2006, CERF grants represented 24% of the funds channelled through WHO’s Health Action in Crises , i.e. more than $24 million, of which $14 million were for rapid response operations and $10.4 for under-funded emergencies."
The Foundations: partnerships,"The Inter-Agency Standing Committee – Established in June 1992 with the purpose to strengthen humanitarian assistance, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) is a unique inter-agency forum for coordination, policy development and decision-making involving the key UN and non-UN humanitarian partners. Under the leadership of the Emergency Relief Coordinator, the IASC develops humanitarian policies, agrees on a clear division of responsibility for the various aspects of humanitarian assistance, identifies and addresses gaps in response, and advocates for effective application of humanitarian principles. WHO is represented in the IASC by its Director-General.The Global Humanitarian Platform – In July 2006, UN agencies, NGOs, the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement, the IOM, and World Bank agreed to convene a forum (GHP) and bring together the three main families of the humanitarian community. The GHP aims at enhancing effective humanitarian action by maximizing the complementarity of different mandates. The GHP will develop “Principles of Partnership”, which will include diversity, mutual respect, responsibility, and transparency, and support their implementation at country level. The GHD agenda privileges a) accountability to the beneficiary populations, b) the capacity of local actors; c) safety and security of humanitarian staff; and d) situations of transition. The GHP meets annually and a Steering Committee oversees the process and sets the strategic directions."
What is WHO’s role within the humanitarian framework?,"In order to advocate for humanitarian health action in crises, WHO participates in the annual humanitarian segment of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) which allows for substantial debates with all stakeholders involved in humanitarian assistance and for keeping health high on the political/humanitarian agenda.Also, to bring health action in crises to the forefront of humanitarian action and contribute to inter-agency coordination, WHO works with the UN Department for the Coordination of Humanitarian Action (OCHA), the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) and other initiatives and entities as relevant. WHO, as a member of the United Nations Development Group (UNDG), is an active player in processes of joint assessments and planning for recovery and reconstruction conducted by the UN and the World Bank. WHO is also part of the United Nations Executive Committee on Humanitarian Affairs (ECHA) which meets on a monthly basis to ensure health as an important component of humanitarian action.To ensure an adequate representation of health needs in the Consolidated Appeals Process (CAP), WHO provides input on the Consolidated Appeals, Common Humanitarian Action Plans (CHAP) and Flash Appeals."
Which inter-agency mechanisms WHO Emergency Risk Management and Humanitarian Response belongs to?,"WHO participates in the work of IASC Taskforce on Preparedness and Contingency Planning and is part of the Framework Team to review/prioritize countries/situations of concern. WHO participates in the inter-agency process to revise the 2001 IASC Guidelines on Contingency Planning.WHO Emergency Risk Management and Humanitarian Response department (ERM) is part of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) and drafted the health chapter of the United Nations Integrated Disarmament Demobilization and Reintegration Standards. It can be seen at http://unddr.org/WHO/ERM works with the International Secretariat for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) support the reduction of environmental, human, economic and social losses. WHO aims to mainstream disaster management, incorporating a public health aspect in country resilience to natural hazards and related technological and environmental disasters. WHO also ensures best public health practice in inter-agency disaster assessments and participates in UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) teams.WHO/ERM is part of the IASC Cluster Working Group on Early Recovery, the UNDG-ECHA Working Group on Transitions and the UNDG Technical Working Group on Somalia. WHO and the IFRC jointly issued a publication entitled Tsunami Relief Impact Assessment and Monitoring.WHO is part of the newly established IASC Task force on Safe Access to Firewood and alternative Energy in Humanitarian Settings.WHO co-chairs the IASC Gender Sub-Working Group. WHO drafted the health chapter of the IASC Gender Handbook for Humanitarian Action Women, Girls, Boys & Men: Different Needs – Equal Opportunities.WHO/ERM is part of the Geographical Information Support Team (GIST), an inter-agency initiative promoting the use of geographical data standards and geographical information systems in support of humanitarian relief operations.WHO/ERM participates in the inter-agency Contact Group on Good Humanitarian Donorship (GHD), a Members States initiative to streamline humanitarian funding.WHO/ERM is part of the IASC Taskforce on HIV/AIDS in emergency settings and promotes the use of the IASC HIV/AIDS Guidelines in Emergency Settings.Human Rights and Humanitarian Action. WHO/ERM is part of the newly established IASC Reference Group on Human Rights and Humanitarian Action. Products developed by this Group include the Human Rights Guidance Note for Humanitarian Coordinators (2006) and Frequently Asked Questions on International Humanitarian, Human Rights and Refugee Law (2004).In order to further protect persons affected by natural disasters, WHO was part of the IASC process which drew up the IASC Operational Guidelines on Human Rights and Natural Disasters. Chapter B.2 provides information about the provision of essential health services.WHO is part of the IASC Information Management Working Group.Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in emergencies. The Inter-Agency Standing Committee Working Group endorsed the IASC Guidelines on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergencies.[pdf, 806 KB] WHO co-chair this Taskforce.Through the Consultative Group on the Use of Military and Civil Defence Assets (MCDA), HAC is promoting cooperation in countries where resources are scarce."
Does WHO have partnerships with non-UN organizations?,"Outside the UN framework, WHO co-operates with a wide network of humanitarian partners worldwide, the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, Collaborating Centres, universities and other academic institutions, NGOs and senior public health experts. Other key partners are Inter-Governmental institutions such as the African Union, the Council of Europe and the International Organization of Civil Protection.For instance, In May 2005, IFRC and WHO signed a Joint Letter of Collaboration to further enhance collaboration between Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and national health authorities.Collaborating centres are scientific or academic institutions which have expertise and facilities in specific aspects of emergency preparedness and response, including training and research to field operations. Their expertise spans disaster reduction, technological emergencies, hospital mitigation, critical incident management, disaster medicine, complex emergencies, emergency communications and information management."
Where does WHO get its funding for crises?,"Emergency Risk Management and Humanitarian Response departments' budget is approved by the World Health Assembly biannually. The budget for the 2008-2009 biennium amounts to USD 218 million, 67% higher than the previous biennium.This budget covers the core work of WHO in humanitarian emergencies and crises across the three levels of the Organization: HQ, Regional Offices, and Country Offices in the following manner:USD 137.9 million at country level;USD 50.9 million at regional level;USD 29.6 million at global level.The sources of funding for the core budget of WHO in the Area of Emergencies and Crises for the period 2008-2009 are:8% assessed contributions from Member States (approximately USD 17 million);92% voluntary contributions (approximately USD 201 million).Voluntary contributions come from different sources:Bilateral contributions from Member States earmarked for specific emergencies;Unearmarked bilateral contributions from Member States;Allocations from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund;Allocations from trust funds and humanitarian pooled funds;Funds from foundations and health partners."
1. Can mothers living with HIV breastfeed their children in the same way as mothers without HIV?,"WHO recommends that all mothers living with HIV should receive life-long antiretroviral therapy (ART) to support their health and to ensure the wellbeing of their infants.WHO released guidelines in July 2016 advising that, in countries that have opted to promote and support breastfeeding together with ART, mothers living with HIV who are on ART and adherent to therapy should breastfeed exclusively for the first 6 months, and then add complementary feeding until 12 months of age. Breastfeeding with complementary feeding may continue until 24 months of age or beyond.Previously, WHO advice was to breastfeed for 12 months but then stop breastfeeding if a nutritionally adequate and safe diet could be provided.The new guidance is based on scientific evidence that shows ART is very effective at preventing HIV transmission through breastfeeding as long as the mother is adherent to therapy. The new evidence means that mothers living with HIV and their children can benefit from the many advantages of breastfeeding – such as improved growth and development – in the same way as mothers who do not have HIV and their children. WHO recommendations emphasise the need for health systems to therefore achieve quality HIV services that reliably provide ART and continue to care for mothers living with HIV."
"2. Is mixed feeding better than no breastfeeding at all, if the mother is on HIV treatment?","Yes. Mothers living with HIV can be reassured that ART reduces the risk of post-natal HIV transmission even when the baby is on mixed feeding. Although exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first 6 months, mixed feeding is better than no breastfeeding. Encouraging mothers living with HIV to breastfeed exclusively is still strongly advised because it benefits the infant in many ways including, reduced illness, and improved growth and development."
"3. If a mother on HIV treatment plans to return to work or school, is a shorter duration of breastfeeding better than no breastfeeding at all?",Yes. Mothers and health-care workers can be reassured that shorter durations of breastfeeding of less than 12 months are better than never initiating breastfeeding.
4. What can be done to support breastfeeding among mothers living with HIV?,"Governments and local authorities should actively promote and implement services to create a supportive environment for mothers living with HIV to remain adherent to treatment and to breastfeed their infants in all settings: at work, at community centres, in health clinics, and in their homes."
What is HIV?,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) targets cells of the immune system, called CD4 cells, which help the body respond to infection. Within the CD4 cell the HIV replicates and in turn damages and destroys the cel.l Without effective treatment, using a combination of antiretroviral drugs, the immune system will become weakened to the point that it can no longer fight infection and disease."
Is AIDS different from HIV?,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a term that applies to the most advanced stages of HIV infection. It is defined by the occurrence of any of the more than 20 life-threatening cancers or “opportunistic infections”, so named because they take advantage of a weakened immune system. AIDS was a defining feature of the earlier years of the HIV epidemic, before antiretroviral therapy (ART) became available. Now, as more and more people access ART, most people living with HIV do not progress to  AIDS. However, it is more likely to occur in people with HIV who have not been tested, in people who are diagnosed at a late stage of infection, and in people who are not taking ART."
"Without treatment, how quickly can a person living with HIV become ill?","For people living with HIV who are not diagnosed or taking ART, signs of HIV-related illness may develop within 5–10 years, although it can be sooner. The time between HIV transmission and an AIDS diagnosis is usually 10–15 years, but sometimes longer."
How is HIV transmitted?,"HIV is found in certain bodily fluids of people living with HIV, including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, rectal fluids and breastmilk. HIV can be transmitted by: unprotected vaginal or anal sex, and, in very rare cases, through oral sex with a person living with HIV;blood transfusion of contaminated blood;sharing of needles, syringes, other injecting equipment, surgical equipment or other sharp instruments; and from a mother living with HIV to her infant during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. If a person living with HIV is on ART, which effectively suppresses HIV in the body, their chance of transmitting HIV to another person is greatly reduced."
How is HIV infection treated?,"While there is no cure for HIV infection, it can be treated using antiretroviral drugs, which work by stopping the replication of the virus. ART can reduce the level of virus to such low levels in the body that the immune system will function normally, and a person living with HIV can enjoy good health, provided they adhere to treatment and the treatment remains effective. People living with HIV are also much less likely to transmit the virus to others when treatment is working."
What does “undetectable” mean?,"Evidence from several studies show that people living with HIV who have an “undetectable” viral load cannot pass HIV on to others. A person is “undetectable” when ART has reduced the level of virus in their body to such low levels that it cannot be detected by normal viral load tests. Monitoring of viral load, and confirmation of an undetectable viral load, needs to be undertaken by a healthcare professional as part of the routine medical care for people with HIV. In many low- and middle-income countries, viral load tests are not consistently or routinely available, so many people do not benefit from the knowledge that they are undetectable. They can be assured, however, that the risk of transmitting HIV is greatly reduced when they adhere to treatment, and when treatment is started without delay."
What illnesses can affect people living with HIV?,"ART allows people with HIV to live long and healthy lives by ensuring that their immune system remains healthy. In certain settings, however, many people living with HIV remain undiagnosed, not on treatment, or not taking consistent treatment, and, as a result their HIV disease progresses. Tuberculosis (TB) is the number one cause of death among people living with HIV in Africa, and a leading cause of death among people living with HIV worldwide. Routine TB-symptom screening and early initiation of ART can greatly improve the health outcomes of people living with HIV. Other common HIV coinfections include hepatitis B and C in some populations.  HIV infection can result in a range of health problems. As people living with HIV age and live longer, non-AIDS defining illnesses are becoming more common. These include heart disease, cancer and diabetes."
How can people get tested for HIV?,"Testing for HIV is the only way to know if a person has HIV or not. HIV can be diagnosed using rapid diagnostic tests that provide results within minutes. However, such results should only be considered as a full diagnosis following review and confirmation
    by a qualified health worker. Knowledge of one’s HIV-positive status has two important benefits:People who test positive can take steps to get treatment, care and support before symptoms appear, which can prolong life and prevent health complications for many years.People who are aware of their status can take precautions to prevent the transmission of HIV to others. WHO recommends that HIV tests be made available in all health facilities, in key community settings and at home via self-testing."
Who is at more risk of HIV?,"The main routes of HIV transmission include unsafe sex without condoms, receiving blood transfusions or other blood products contaminated with HIV, sharing of needles and syringes and other injecting equipment, being exposed to HIV through contaminated surgical and other skin piercing equipment and vertical transmission from mothers with HIV to their children. HIV is fully preventable; different interventions exist to stop transmission. However, many people are not accessing necessary information and skills to prevent HIV. In some cases, major legal and social barriers prevent people from accessing effective prevention services and measures. Some populations are at higher risk of HIV infection, including men who have sex with men; people who inject drugs; people in prisons and other closed settings; sex workers and their clients; and transgender people. These populations are referred to as ‘key populations’, who are often marginalized in communities and experience major barriers in accessing HIV prevention and treatment and other health services. In some settings, other populations may be particularly vulnerable to HIV infection, such as adolescent girls in southern Africa."
How can sexual transmission of HIV be prevented?,"Globally, HIV is mainly transmitted through unprotected vaginal and anal sex. Several methods can be used to prevent this from happening. It is recommended that a combination of effective prevention interventions be used, including:using male and/or female condoms consistently and correctly;for HIV-negative people, taking pre-exposure prophylaxis of HIV (PrEP) to prevent HIV transmission;for people living with HIV, taking ART to reduce viral load to undetectable levels, meaning they can’t transmit HIV to their sexual partners; andbeing aware of one’s status to promote less risky sexual behaviours."
How can vertical transmission of HIV be prevented?,"HIV can be transmitted from a mother to her child during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding. But such vertical transmission can be prevented with effective interventions, including the use of ART by the mother and a short course of antiretroviral drugs for the baby. Other effective interventions include measures to prevent HIV acquisition in pregnant woman, prevent unintended pregnancies in women with HIV and appropriate breastfeeding practices. HIV testing services should be integrated into maternal and child health services, so that they women at risk can readily access testing. Pregnant women and mothers diagnosed with HIV should receive ART as soon as possible, so that their children are born free from HIV."
What is PrEP?,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is a course of antiretroviral drugs that HIV-negative people can take to prevent HIV acquisition. When taken as recommended, it can practically eliminate the chance of acquiring HIV. PrEP is recommended for populations who are at higher risk of HIV. These groups may include men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who use drugs, and young women in southern Africa."
How does male circumcision prevent HIV transmission?,"Male circumcision reduces the risk of sexual transmission from a woman to a man by around 60%. A one-time intervention, medical male circumcision provides life-long partial protection against HIV, as well as other sexually transmitted infections. It should always be considered as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package, and should never replace other known methods of prevention, such as female and male condoms."
How effective are condoms in preventing HIV?,"When used correctly and consistently every time a person has sex, condoms are among the most effective means of preventing HIV infection in women and men."
Is there a cure for HIV?,"No, there is currently no cure for HIV. But with good and continued adherence to ART, HIV infection can be contained and managed as a chronic health condition. In all parts of the world, people living with HIV are now surviving and thriving into old age."
What other kinds of care do people living with HIV need?,"While ART helps the immune system stay strong, people living with HIV can benefit from counselling and psychosocial support to ensure that they are truly “living well” with HIV. HIV is manageable, but it is a life-long chronic illness, and people may need support with their mental health and with lifestyle changes to support good health through life. Access to good nutrition, safe water and basic hygiene can also help people living with HIV to maintain a good quality of life. As with the general community, people living with HIV may experience a broad range of other health conditions that may need treatment and care. A people-centred approach to health care, particularly through primary health services, aims to deliver comprehensive health services to people living with HIV, in which all their health issues are addressed."
What is hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection?,"Hepatitis B is a viral infection that affects the liver and can cause both acute and chronic infection.  Most people with HBV infection do not experience any symptoms when newly infected. A proportion of people develop chronic infection, which can then lead to progressive liver disease and result in cirrhosis (a scarring of the liver) or liver cancer. Chronic infection occurs in the majority (90%) of infants infected from their mothers or before 5 years of age. Those infected after the age of five years are much less likely (<5%) to develop a chronic infection."
What is the global burden of HBV?,"Worldwide, WHO estimates that 257 million people are currently living with chronic HBV infection worldwide, placing them at risk of serious illness and death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. Each year, WHO estimates that chronic HBV infection causes nearly 900 000 deaths, mostly through complications such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. The countries with the highest prevalence are in the WHO African and Western Pacific Regions, and the countries with the lowest prevalence are in the Region of the Americas and the European Region."
How is HBV infection diagnosed?,"It is not possible, on clinical grounds, to differentiate hepatitis B from hepatitis caused by other viruses. Laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is therefore needed. Chronic infection is diagnosed by a positive test for the surface antigen of HBV (HBsAg). When a person tests positive for HBsAg, an HBV DNA test should also be done to determine how high the viral load is. Those with a high HBV viral load and with raised liver enzymes may need to be put on long-term antiviral treatment for their own health. Persons with cirrhosis are also in need of treatment. However, only a proportion of people with chronic HBV infection will require treatment. If the HBV DNA test is not available, a test for e-antigen of HBV (HBeAg) is sometimes used to give a less accurate indication of the level of virus in the blood."
How is HBV transmitted and who is most at risk of contracting HBV infection?,"Hepatitis B is spread mainly through exposure to various body fluids, including blood, saliva, menstrual, vaginal, and seminal fluids. Worldwide, the virus is most commonly spread from mother-to-child during birth (vertical transmission) as well as through horizontal early childhood transmission, and these routes of HBV transmission are responsible for most chronic infections. Transmission can also result from unsafe injections and poor infection control practices during medical, surgical, and dental procedures, sexual transmission among men who have sex with men, and through unscreened blood donations."
How important is mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B?,"Worldwide, the most common route of transmission of hepatitis B is mother-to-child during birth (vertical transmission) as well as through horizontal early childhood transmission. These routes of HBV transmission are also responsible for most chronic
    infections. Therefore, prevention of these infections from mother-to-child or early childhood transmission is the most important strategy to control the HBV epidemic. Transmission of HBV from mother to child is more common in children born to women
    who have a high level of hepatitis B virus in the blood (known as HBV viral load). In the absence of any preventive interventions, the risk of transmission from mother to child ranges from 70% to 90% for mothers with high HBV viral load (or are HBeAg-positive) and from 10% to 40% for those that are HBeAg negative. These high maternal concentrations of HBV DNA (viral load) are associated with an elevated risk of transmission, even among infants who receive the hepatitis B vaccine. For this reason, pregnant women with high HBV DNA levels may benefit from antiviral prophylaxis during pregnancy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and protect their infants from becoming infected."
Can HBV infections be prevented?,"Yes, there is a safe and effective vaccine. Three doses provide 98%-100% protection against HBV infection. WHO recommends that all infants receive a first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after birth, preferably within 24 hours. This birth dose should be followed by at least 2 additional doses, given at least 4 weeks apart. Protection lasts at least 20 years and is probably lifelong. Since 1992, WHO has recommended the inclusion of the hepatitis B vaccine as part of routine vaccination services through the Expanded Programme on Immunization. Infant hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) prophylaxis (preventive treatment) shortly after birth and preventive maternal peripartum prophylaxis (preventive treatment) antivirals can provide additional protection to that provided by a timely birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine."
"Globally, what proportion of children have received the hepatitis B vaccine?","Major progress in the global response to HBV infection has been made through the expansion of routine hepatitis B vaccination. In 2019, coverage of 3 doses of the vaccine reached 85% worldwide compared to around 30% in 2000. However, coverage of the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose remains uneven. For example, coverage of the birth dose is 43% globally and only 6% in the WHO African Region. According to latest WHO estimates, the proportion of children under five years of age chronically infected with HBV dropped to just under 1% in 2019 down from around 5% in the pre-vaccine era (the period between the 1980s and the early 2000s)."
Why are new guidelines on use of antivirals to prevent mother-to-child transmission needed?,"WHO already recommends that all infants receive their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after birth, preferably within 24 hours, and that the birth dose be followed by at least 2 additional doses of hepatitis B vaccine, administered at least four weeks apart. In the 2015 WHO guidelines for prevention, care and treatment of persons with chronic HBV infection, no recommendation was made for the additional use of antiviral therapy to prevent mother-to-child HBV transmission. This was because of the still limited and low-quality evidence base with several ongoing trials, and the lack of consensus as to the programmatic implications of a policy for more widespread use of antivirals in pregnancy. The new recommendations were prompted by 3 key developments. First, additional evidence has become available on the efficacy and safety of antiviral prophylaxis in pregnant women and their children. Second, WHO has received requests for updated guidance from countries and regions that had already achieved high birth dose and infant vaccination coverage but had not yet achieved the 2030 WHO elimination target of less than 0.1% prevalence of HBV in 5-year-old children. Third, data from epidemiological studies and modelling suggest that infant vaccination alone would insufficient to reach the WHO goal of 0.1% HBsAg prevalence in children by 2030, and that antiviral prophylaxis for pregnant women may also be needed in some contexts."
What are the new WHO recommendations for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HBV infection?,"There are 2 new recommendations:In addition to the series of hepatitis B vaccinations (including a first dose within 24 hours of birth), WHO now recommends that pregnant women testing positive for HBV infection (HBsAg positive) with an HBV DNA viral load threshold of ≥5.3 log10
        IU/mL (≥200,000 IU/mL) receive tenofovir prophylaxis; the preventive therapy should be provided from the 28th week of pregnancy until at least birth. (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).In settings where antenatal HBV DNA testing is not available, WHO now recommends the use of HBeAg testing as an alternative to determine eligibility for tenofovir prophylaxis for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HBV (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).  This is because some settings have poor access to tests that quantify an individual’s HBV viral load and determine whether a pregnant woman would be eligible for preventive treatment or prophylaxis. This
        is especially the case in low-income settings or, rural areas where many antenatal care visits take place.Pregnant women should first be assessed for eligibility for long-term antiviral treatment based on their own health needs. If this is the case, the treatment they will receive will also ensure prophylaxis.  The indications for treatment in HBV-infected pregnant women are the same as that for non-pregnant adults, and are outlined in the 2015 Guidelines for the prevention, care and treatment of persons with chronic hepatitis B infection"
What is the evidence to support these new recommendations?,"Evidence to inform the recommendations included two commissioned systematic reviews and meta-analyses, impact and cost-effectiveness modelling, an assessment of the overall balance of benefits and harms (at individual and population levels), patient/health worker values and preferences, resource use, cost-effectiveness, considerations on equity and human rights, and considerations of feasibility across the different WHO regions. A WHO-commissioned systematic review of 129 studies showed a substantial protective effect of using antiviral prophylaxis in preventing mother-to-child transmission in infants born to HBV-infected women, regardless of the antiviral used. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is the medicine of choice for treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection and also prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and has a high barrier to development of drug resistance. Use of TDF was also safe.  The Guidelines Development Group also determined an HBV DNA viral load threshold of ≥5.3 log10 IU/mL (≥200,000 IU/mL) at which pregnant women are eligible to receive tenofovir prophylaxis. This is because pregnant woman with a viral load above this level may transmit HBV to their infant even when the infant receives the timely birth dose vaccine, HBIG and completes the full hepatitis B vaccine series. Although HBV DNA measurement is the reference method to determine eligibility for tenofovir prophylaxis, the use of HBeAg was recommended as an acceptable alternative test in settings where access to HBV DNA quantification is limited. This was based on a further systematic review that showed the overall sensitivity and specificity of HBeAg for diagnosis of high HBV viral load (defined as ≥5.3 log10 IU/mL) was 88.2% (95% CI: 83.9–91.5) and 92.6% (95% CI: 90–94.5) respectively. Overall, HBeAg has a high sensitivity but lower specificity for predicting the risk of mother-to-child transmission. A global values and preferences survey showed a broad level of acceptability of HBV testing in pregnant women with use of antivirals in those eligible, but concerns about potential costs."
How feasible will it be to implement these new recommendations?,"Experience from elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis suggests that providing testing for pregnant women followed by antiviral prophylaxis for eligible women to prevent infection is feasible. Programmes aimed at preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV are the most mature and have shown remarkable success. For example, by the end of 2018, approximately 79% of pregnant women globally knew their HIV status, and 82% of those who tested positive for HIV received treatment. However, although the majority of women are offered HIV testing at antenatal care visits, the same is not yet true for syphilis or HBV testing. An online consultation held in 2019 as part of the guidelines development process among 153 health care workers, 56 programme managers and 81 civil society representatives reported that 77% of respondents felt it was feasible to provide HBV testing and offer eligible pregnant women tenofovir prophylaxis. Challenges reported by stakeholders included the high cost and low availability of HBV viral load assessment, inadequate training of health care workers, limited knowledge of HBV infection among women living with HBV infection, and a lack of capacity and infrastructure to test and treat pregnant women. These issues will need to be addressed to enable full implementation of routine testing of all pregnant women, as well as the use of antivirals in those with high HBV viral load or HBeAg status."
What are the key messages for countries and regions?,"WHO regions are faced with different scenarios with respect to prevalence of HBV infection, service coverage of immunization (including birth dose), and in availability of commodities for diagnostics, antiviral prophylaxis and treatment. The implementation of the different recommendations to prevent mother-to-child transmission may therefore vary by region. Universal immunization of infants with the HBV vaccine, including a timely birth dose, is the foundation of programmes to prevent HBV infection at birth and in the first years of life in all settings. Countries that have not yet reached the 2020 goal of 1% HBsAg prevalence among children aged 5 years through vaccination should focus their efforts on increasing their coverage of infant hepatitis B vaccination, and a timely birth dose. This applies particularly to the African and Eastern Mediterranean region. However, for regions and countries that have already achieved a high coverage of hepatitis B infant vaccination, and the birth dose, implementation of these new recommendations for peripartum tenofovir prophylaxis in pregnant women with high viral loads would help further prevent perinatal HBV infections. This applies particularly to countries in the Regions of the Western Pacific and South East Asia. In the Americas and the European region, testing in view of prophylaxis is already been used and these guidelines can provide an additional reference."
What are the cost-effectiveness considerations?,"Scaling up access to a timely birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine is the most cost-effective option for preventing infection; this single intervention delivers the greatest health benefit for the lowest cost. However, in countries that have already achieved high hepatitis B vaccination coverage and, as a result, reduction in infections due to horizontal transmission in early childhood, mother-to-child vertical infections now account for a higher proportion of the remaining transmission. In these settings, routine testing for HBV infection among pregnant women, and providing tenofovir prophylaxis for those who are eligible, is an additional opportunity to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HBV. This complementary intervention may be cost-effective in some regions depending on the costs of diagnostics (ie. HBV DNA or HBeAg), and on how such a strategy is implemented."
Are any countries already implementing the new recommendations?,"Countries in several regions with a low burden of HBV infection have gained some experience in the use of peripartum prophylaxis, especially in the Americas, Western Pacific and Europe. Further expanded implementation of the recommendations for peripartum prophylaxis would prevent more perinatal HBV infections.In the WHO Region of the Americas, in 2017, 24 countries were routinely testing pregnant women for HBsAg, and 22 countries providing HBIG for exposed newborns. In the WHO European Region (mostly high-income countries with low baseline prevalence of HBV infection) some countries have not implemented universal hepatitis B vaccination but instead rely on testing all pregnant women and then providing targeted birth dose vaccine to children born to HBsAg-positive mothers.  In the WHO South East Asian Region, antiviral prophylaxis has been used in certain countries where HBV is highly endemic and mother-to-child transmission is common, such as in Thailand. In the WHO Western Pacific Region, despite achieving overall high vaccination coverage including birth dose, there are some countries that still have a very high HBV prevalence in the general population and also large populations. As a result, breakthrough infections that occur despite vaccination still account for a significant number of mother-to-child infections.  A number of these countries have spearheaded efforts to further reduce mother-to-child transmission, including the use of antiviral prophylaxis and follow up of exposed infants. For example, in China, universal antenatal testing for HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis has been offered since 2011, and comprehensive interventions including antiviral prophylaxis were established in three provinces as part of pilot projects on triple elimination. Other countries, have established pilot projects for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of HBV in four states (Malaysia), updated national guidelines for EMTCT to include HBV and HCV (Mongolia), developed triple elimination national action plans (Cambodia and Vietnam) or frameworks (Philippines and Papua New Guinea).In the WHO African and Eastern Mediterranean Regions, experience with peripartum prophylaxis is still very limited, and the priority is to expand coverage of vaccination that remains heterogeneous."
"What is ‘triple elimination” and are any regions implementing triple elimination of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B?","‘Triple elimination’ is an initiative that promotes the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of three infections - HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B virus, which are all prevalent in low- and middle-income countries. Two WHO regions – the Region of the Americas and also the Western Pacific Region – have triple elimination plans and a framework for triple elimination. In 2016, the WHO Region of the Americas endorsed “EMTCT Plus,” a new framework for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, HBV, syphilis, and Chagas disease. Several countries in this region have introduced antiviral prophylaxis for pregnant women. In 2017, the WHO Regional Committee of the Western Pacific Region endorsed the Regional framework for the triple elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis in Asia and the Pacific, 2018–2030. The framework proposes a coordinated approach to combatting these 3 diseases through access to quality reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health care. A number of countries in the region including China are spearheading this effort and have developed triple elimination national action plans and frameworks."
What is hepatitis B?,"Hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis B virus 
(HBV). The virus interferes with the functions of the liver and causes 
pathological damage. A small percentage of infected people cannot get 
rid of the virus and become chronically infected – these people are at 
higher risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer."
How do you get hepatitis B?,"HBV is spread by contact with blood or body fluids of an 
infected person – the same way as the human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV). However, HBV is 50 to 100 times more infectious than HIV.The main ways of getting infected with HBV are:from mother to baby at the birth (perinatal)from child-to-child unsafe injections and transfusionsunprotected sexual contact.Worldwide, most infections occur from mother-to-child, from 
child-to-child (especially in household settings), and from reuse of 
unsterilized needles and syringes. Before the widespread use of the 
hepatitis B vaccine, almost all children in developing countries used to
 become infected with the virus."
How is Hepatitis B NOT spread?,"Hepatitis B virus is NOT spread by sharing eating utensils, 
breastfeeding, hugging, kissing, holding hands, coughing, sneezing or by
 recreational use of public pools or the like."
How can I protect myself?,"You can protect yourself against hepatitis B by being vaccinated. 
The hepatitis B vaccine has an outstanding record of safety and 
effectiveness, and since 1982, over 1 billion doses have been used 
worldwide. The vaccine is 95% effective in preventing chronic infections
 from developing. Protection lasts for 20 years at least, no booster is 
recommended by WHO as of today."
What is hepatitis?,"Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. The condition can be self-limiting or can progress to fibrosis (scarring), cirrhosis or liver cancer. Hepatitis viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis in the world but other infections, toxic substances (e.g. alcohol, certain drugs), and autoimmune diseases can also cause hepatitis.
There are 5 main hepatitis viruses, referred to as types A, B, C, D and E. These 5 types are of greatest concern because of the burden of illness and death they cause and the potential for outbreaks and epidemic spread. In particular, types B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people and, together, are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer. Hepatitis A and E are typically caused by ingestion of contaminated food or water. Hepatitis B, C and D usually occur as a result of parenteral contact with infected body fluids. Common modes of transmission for these viruses include receipt of contaminated blood or blood products, invasive medical procedures using contaminated equipment and for hepatitis B transmission from mother to baby at birth, from family member to child, and also by sexual contact. Acute infection may occur with limited or no symptoms, or may include symptoms such as jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain."
What are the different hepatitis viruses?,"Scientists have identified 5 unique hepatitis viruses, identified by the letters A, B, C, D, and E. While all cause liver disease, they vary in important ways.


Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further HAV infections. However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV. 

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV. 

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV.

Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease in developed countries. Safe and effective vaccines to prevent HEV infection have been developed but are not widely available."
What’s the best advice for staying safe during a heatwave?,"To protect yourself during a heatwave, you should:Move to the coolest room in the home, especially at night. If it is not possible to keep your home cool, spend 2-3 hours of the day in a cool place (such as an airconditioned public building). Avoid going outside during the hottest time of the day. Avoid strenuous physical activity if you can. If you must do strenuous activity, do it during the coolest part of the day, which is usually in the morning between 04:00 and 07:00. Stay in the shade. Do not leave children or animals in parked vehicles."
How do I keep my body cool during a heatwave?,"Keep the body cool and hydrated by taking cool showers or baths during a heatwave. You can also use cold packs and wraps, towels, sponging, and foot baths to keep cool. Wear light, loose-fitting clothes of natural materials. If you go outside, wear a wide-brimmed hat or cap and sunglasses. Use light bed linen and sheets, and no cushions, to avoid heat accumulation. Drink regularly, but avoid alcohol and too much caffeine and sugar. Eat small meals and eat more often. Avoid foods that are high in protein."
What should I do if I feel unwell during a heatwave?,"If you feel dizzy, weak, anxious or have intense thirst and headache during a heatwave, it is best to move to a cool place as soon as possible and measure your body temperature. Drink some water or fruit juice to rehydrate. Rest immediately in a cool place if you have painful muscular spasms (particularly in the legs, arms or abdomen), and drink oral rehydration solutions containing electrolytes. Medical attention is needed if heat cramps last more than 1 hour. Consult your doctor if you feel unusual symptoms or if symptoms persist.If one of your family members or people you assist presents hot dry skin and delirium, convulsions and/or unconsciousness, call a doctor/ambulance immediately. While waiting for help, move the person to a cool place, put him or her in a horizontal position and elevate legs and hips, remove clothing and initiate external cooling, for example, by placing cold packs on the neck, axillae and groin, fanning continuously and spraying the skin with water at 25–30 °C. Measure the body temperature. Do not give acetylsalicylic acid or paracetamol. Position an unconscious person on his or her side."
How do I keep my home cool during a heatwave?,"During a heatwave you should aim to keep your living space cool. Check the room temperature between 08:00 and 10:00, at 13:00 and at night after 22:00. Ideally, the room temperature should be kept below 32 °C during the day and 24 °C during the night. This is especially important for infants or adults over the age of 60 or who have chronic health conditions. At night and early morning when the outside temperature is lower, open all the windows and shutters in your home. During the day, close the windows and shutters (if available), especially those facing the sun during the day. Turn off artificial lighting and as many electrical devices as possible. Hang shades, draperies, awnings or louvers on windows that receive morning or afternoon sun. Hang wet towels to cool down the room air. Note that the humidity of the air increases at the same time.If your residence is air conditioned, close the doors and windows and conserve electricity not needed to keep you cool, to ensure that power remains available and reduce the chance of a community-wide outage. Electric fans may provide relief, but when the temperature is above 35 °C, may not prevent heat-related illness. It is important to drink fluids."
What is a healthy diet for breastfeed babies and young children?,"From birth to 6 months of age, feed babies exclusively with breast milk (i.e. give them no other food or drink) and feed them on demand (i.e. as often as they want, day and night).At 6 months of age, introduce a variety of safe and nutritious foods to complement breastfeeding, and continue to breastfeed until babies are 2 years of age or beyond. Do not add salt or sugars to foods for babies and young children."
Why should babies be breastfed exclusively?,"On its own, breast milk provides all the nutrients and fluids that babies need for their first 6 months of healthy growth and development. Exclusively breastfed babies have better resistance against common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea, respiratory infections and ear infections. In later life, those who were breastfed as infants are less likely to become overweight or obese, or to suffer from noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease and stroke."
Why is it important to eat a variety of foods?,"Eating a variety of whole (i.e. unprocessed) and fresh foods every day helps children and adults to obtain the right amounts of essential nutrients. It also helps them to avoid a diet that is high in sugars, fats and salt, which can lead to unhealthy weight gain (i.e. overweight and obesity) and noncommunicable diseases. Eating a healthy, balanced diet is especially important for young children's development. It also helps older people to have healthier and more active lives.WHO recommends that people eat a combination of different foods, including staple foods (e.g. cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, maize or rice, or starchy tubers or roots such as potato, yam, taro or cassava), legumes (e.g. lentils, beans), vegetables, fruit and foods from animals sources (e.g. meat, fish, eggs and milk)."
What are the benefits of eating plenty of vegetables and fruit?,"WHO recommends that people eat a wide variety of vegetables and fruit. For snacks, choose raw vegetables and fresh fruit, rather than foods that are high in sugars, fats or salt. Avoid overcooking vegetables and fruit as this can lead to the loss of important vitamins. When using canned or dried vegetables and fruit, choose varieties without added salt and sugarsVegetables and fruit are important sources of vitamins, minerals, dietary fibre, plant protein and antioxidants. People whose diets are rich in vegetables and fruit have a significantly lower risk of obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and certain types of cancer."
Is it healthy to eat moderate amounts of fats and oils?,"Moderate amounts of fats and oils are part of a healthy diet. Fats and oils are concentrated sources of energy, and eating too much fat, particularly the wrong kinds of fat, can be harmful to health. For example, people who eat too much saturated fat and trans-fat are at higher risk of heart disease and stroke. Trans-fat may occur naturally in certain meat and milk products, but the industrially produced trans-fat (e.g. partially hydrogenated oils) present in various processed foods is the main source.Use unsaturated vegetable oils (e.g. olive, soy, sunflower or corn oil) rather than animals fats or oils high in saturated fats (e.g. butter, ghee, lard, coconut and palm oil).When possible, choose white meat (e.g. poultry) and fish, which are generally low in fats, rather than red meat. Eat only limited amounts of processed meats because these are high in fat and salt. Try also to opt for low-fat or reduced fat versions of milk and dairy products. Avoid processed, baked and fried foods that contain industrially produced trans-fat."
How can I reduce my intake of salt and sugar?,"People whose diets are high in sodium (including salt) have a greater risk of high blood pressure, which can increase their risk of heart disease and stroke. Similarly, those whose diets are high in sugars have a greater risk of becoming overweight or obese, and an increased risk of tooth decay. People who reduce the amount of sugars in their diet may also reduce their risk of noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease and stroke.When cooking and preparing foods, limit the amount of salt and high-sodium condiments (e.g. soy sauce and fish sauce). Also, try to avoid foods like snacks that are high in salt and sugars. Limit intake of soft drinks or soda and other drinks that are high in sugars (e.g. fruit juices, cordials and syrups, flavoured milks and yogourt drinks), and choose fresh fruits instead of sweet snacks such as cookies, cakes and chocolate."
How do statistics improve health?,"Countries need health statistics in order to identify why 
people die or what causes illness or injury. This information enables 
countries to target their health problems and prioritize the use of 
precious health resources.Every year WHO analyses data from its 194 Member States and 
produces burden of disease and mortality health estimates, which are 
published in the ""World health statistics"". These estimates are a report
 card of global health. They tell us, for example, that risks to health 
are changing. Fewer people are dying from infectious diseases in low- 
and middle-income countries but more people are suffering from chronic 
diseases due to changing patterns of physical activity and consumption 
of alcohol, tobacco and food. These countries now suffer from a double 
burden of chronic, non-communicable conditions as well as the diseases 
that traditionally affect the poor."
How does WHO collect statistics?,"WHO statistics are generated from multiple sources using a 
variety of data collection methods, including household surveys, routine
 reporting by health services, civil registration and censuses and 
disease surveillance systems.In estimating country figures, WHO applies methods of analysis
 that improve data quality and ensure transparency in the application of
 the adjustments that are needed to make the data more comparable across
 countries and over time. (Data that are comparable have been generated 
using the same or similar methods, for similar populations and time 
periods, using standard definitions).WHO is working with countries to improve the quality of health
 information. Currently, WHO receives cause-of-death statistics 
regularly from only about 100 Member States.. Globally, two-thirds (38 
million) of 56 million annual deaths are not registered. WHO makes its data and analyses accessible through the Global 
Health Observatory portal as well as databases that provide statistics 
on a wide range of diseases and health indicators. Related linksGlobal Health Observatory"
What is health promotion?,"Health promotion enables people to increase control over their 
own health. It covers a wide range of social and environmental 
interventions that are designed to benefit and protect individual 
people’s health and quality of life by addressing  and preventing the 
root causes of ill health, not just focusing on treatment and cure.  
		There are 3 key elements of health promotion:1.	Good governance for healthHealth promotion requires policy makers across all government 
departments to make health a central line of government policy.  This 
means they must factor health implications into all the decisions they 
take, and prioritize policies that prevent people from becoming ill and 
protect them from injuries.  These policies must be supported by regulations that match 
private sector incentives with public health goals. For example, by 
aligning tax policies on unhealthy or harmful products such as alcohol, 
tobacco, and food products which are high in salt, sugars and fat with 
measures to boost trade in other areas. And through legislation that 
supports healthy urbanization by creating walkable cities, reducing air 
and water pollution, enforcing the wearing of seat belts and helmets.  2.	Health literacyPeople need to acquire the knowledge, skills and information 
to make healthy choices, for example about the food they eat and 
healthcare services that they need. They need to have opportunities  to 
make those choices. And they need to be assured of an environment in 
which people can demand further policy actions to further improve their 
health.  3.	Healthy cities Cities have a key role to play in promoting good health. 
Strong leadership and commitment at the municipal level is essential to 
healthy urban planning and to build up preventive measures in 
communities and primary health care facilities.  From healthy cities 
evolve healthy countries and, ultimately, a healthier world."
What are some of the steps in decision and policy-making?,"During the scoping stage of HIA, explore the policy’s context by answering the questions:


        ‘What is at stake (proposals, potential health impacts, other interests)‘.‘How does the policy come about (is there a consultation of stakeholders and citizens or is decision-making undertaken by one central actor) and how can HIA connect with this process’.‘Who are involved in the policy making process (decision-maker(s), stakeholders, researchers and other experts, citizens)’.‘What does the institutional context look like (formal decision-making procedures, communication rules, and informal relations between the several actors involved)’.This exploration can identify opportunities for the
                HIA to link up with decision-makers and stakeholders who have similar interests. Also, the HIA has a better chance of anticipating difficulties in the process, and being able to develop strategies to address these difficulties.Produce an HIA that has a plan for active dissemination of HIA messages at key stages. Announcing the HIA (when it begins, and at other key steps, etc), disseminating preliminary findings, and using discussion groups will help to put health interests
        on the agenda of agencies. These steps are equally as important as producing a sound report. HIA practitioners realise that the process does not stop when the report has been produced and the ‘decision’ made.HIA practitioners should try to establish long-term relationships with decision-makers. Gaining the commitment of the ‘health authority/department’ will help achieve this during intersectoral policy development.Where appropriate, include a wide variety of stakeholders in the process, and draw on the best available qualitative and quantitative evidence. Policy makers appreciate these HIA values as they also underpin their own work. The inclusion of local
        communities provides policy makers with data and information that is typically hard to get, which is grounded in the realities of the local environment and is rich in experience.Ensure that a longer-term follow-up of the HIA can be made to determine the actual impacts from the policy or project on the health awareness among others, on the health determinants and finally on health itself. The appropriateness of these different
        levels of evaluation is discussed in ‘Evaluating your HIA’"
What happened?,"On 11 March 2011, a magnitude 9 earthquake occurred off the east coast of Japan, generating a tsunami that severely damaged coastal areas and resulted in 15 891 deaths and 2579 missing people. As a consequence of the tsunami, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (FDNPS), located along the shoreline, lost its core cooling capacity which caused severe damage to the reactor’s core and led to a nuclear accident rated as Level 7 on the International Nuclear Events Scale (INES). Substantial amounts of radioactive materials (radionuclides) were released into the environment following explosions at the FDNPS on March 12, 14 and 15."
What were the main radionuclides to which people were exposed?,"People living in the vicinity of the FDNPS were exposed externally to irradiation from the radioactive cloud and ground deposits and internally from inhalation and ingestion of radionuclides. The main radionuclides to which individuals were exposed included iodine-131 (131I) and caesium-137 (137Cs). 131I has a radioactive half-life of eight days and can be inhaled with the air and ingested with contaminated food or water, mainly by consumption of contaminated milk and leafy vegetables. In the human body, iodine concentrates in the thyroid gland. Exposure to radioactive iodine is usually higher for children than for adults because of the size of their thyroid glands and the nature of their metabolism. 137Cs has a half-life of 30 years and this implies long term risk of exposure through ingestion and through exposure from ground deposition."
What levels of radiation have people been exposed to?,"Doses of radiation have been estimated based on models and measurements for different representative groups of individuals of the Japanese population. The assessment of the doses included both external and internal (through inhalation of the radioactive
    plume and ingestion of radioactivity in food) exposure pathways. A large survey of the health of residents of Fukushima Prefecture, the Fukushima Health Management Survey,
 has estimated individual doses based on typical scenarios of evacuation and time spent indoors and outdoors. Based on this survey and the dose
    assessments done by WHO and by UNSCEAR, the average lifetime effective doses for adults in the Fukushima prefecture were estimated to be around 10 mSv or less, and about twice for 1-year old infants.
    See:Preliminary dose estimation from the nuclear accident after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and TsunamiSources, effects and risks of ionizing radiation, UNSCEAR 2013 Report, vol. 1The doses incurred by workers were reported by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and by some of its contractors. According to TEPCO records, the average workers’ effective dose over the first 19 months after the accident was about 12 mSv. About 35% of the workforce received total doses of more than 10 mSv over that period, while 0.7% of the workforce received doses of more than 100 mSv. Based on the UNSCEAR assessment, 12 of the most exposed workers received thyroid doses in the range of 2 to 12 Gy, mostly from inhalation of 131I."
What were the main public health consequences of the disaster?,"There were public health consequences related to the response actions to the disaster, such as evacuation and relocation of people. These measures were taken based on radiation safety considerations and the massive damage to the infrastructure and facilities following the earthquake and tsunami. These measures resulted in a wide range of social, economic, and public health consequences. A sharp increase in mortality among elderly people who were put in temporary housings has been reported, along with increased risk of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and mental health problems. The lack of access to health care further contributed to deterioration of health.Similar to what was observed and reported for the Chernobyl population, the displaced Fukushima population is suffering from psycho-social and mental health impact following relocation, ruptured social links of people who lost homes and employment, disconnected family ties and stigmatization. A higher occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among the evacuees was assessed as compared to the general population of Japan. Psychological problems, such as hyperactivity, emotional symptoms, and conduct disorders have been also reported among evacuated Fukushima children6. While no significant adverse outcomes were observed in the pregnancy and birth survey after the disaster, a higher prevalence of postpartum depression was noted among mothers in the affected region.See:Psychological distress and the perception of radiation risks: the Fukushima health management survey  - WHO bulletin 2015"
What are the health implications of the Fukushima Daiichi NPS (FDNPS) nuclear accident?,"In 2013, WHO published a health risk assessment from the FDNPS accident. It included an evaluation of the risks of cancers, non-cancer diseases as well as public health considerations. The following year, UNSCEAR published a report on the levels and effects
    of radiation exposure due to the accident. In 2015, UNSCEAR released a white paper that evaluates new information in the peer-reviewed literature.See:Health risk assessment from the nuclear accident after the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami, based on a preliminary dose estimationSources, effects and risks of ionizing radiation, UNSCEAR 2013 Report, Vol. IDevelopments since the 2013 UNSCEAR Report on the levels and effects of radiation exposure due to the nuclear accident following the great east-Japan earthquake and tsunami - UNSCEAR Fukushima 2015 White PaperThere were no acute radiation injuries or deaths among the workers or the public due to exposure to radiation resulting from the FDNPS accident.Considering the level of estimated doses, the lifetime radiation-induced cancer risks other than thyroid are small and much smaller than the lifetime baseline cancer risks. Regarding the risk of thyroid cancer in exposed infants and children,
            the level of risk is uncertain since it is difficult to verify thyroid dose estimates by direct measurements of radiation exposure.For the twelve workers who were estimated to have received the highest absorbed radiation doses to the thyroid, an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer and other thyroid disorders was estimated. About 160 additional workers who received whole body effective doses estimated to be over 100 mSv, an increased risk of cancer could be expected in the future although it will not be detectable by epidemiological studies because of the difficulty of confirming a small incidence against the normal statistical fluctuations in cancer incidence.From a global health perspective, the health risks directly related to radiation exposure are low in Japan and extremely low in neighbouring countries and the rest of the world."
Is there a risk of radiation-induced thyroid cancer among children of Fukushima prefecture?,"Given the exposure to radioactive iodine during the early phase of the emergency, WHO specifically assessed the risk of thyroid cancer. The greatest risk was found among girls exposed as infants (i.e. < 1 year old) in the most affected area in the Fukushima prefecture. Even if those levels of risk might not be clinically detectable, WHO anticipated that the thyroid ultrasound screening programme being conducted in Fukushima prefecture was likely to lead to an increase in the incidence of thyroid diseases due to earlier detection of non-symptomatic cases.There have been recent reports about thyroid cancer cases being diagnosed among children exposed to low doses of radioactive iodine as a result of the Fukushima accident. These reports should be interpreted with caution. A large excess of thyroid cancer due to radiation exposure, such as occurred after the Chernobyl accident, can be discounted because the estimated thyroid doses due to the Fukushima accident were substantially lower than in Chernobyl. Nevertheless, the highly-sensitive thyroid screening of those under 18 years old at the time of the accident is expected to detect a large number of thyroid cysts and solid nodules, including a number of thyroid cancers that would not have been detected without such intensive screening. Similar or even slightly higher rates of cysts and nodules were found in prefectures not affected by the nuclear accident. The substantial number of cases that have already been observed in the Fukushima Health Management Survey have been considered likely due to the sensitivity of the screening rather than to radiation exposure. Further analysis of epidemiological data being currently collected in Japan will be necessary to evaluate a potential attribution of thyroid cancer to radiation exposure."
Is there any risk from radioactive food contamination in Japan today?,"Radioactive iodine and caesium in concentrations above the Japanese regulatory limits were detected in some food commodities as a result of food monitoring in the early period after the accident. Since the early phase of the emergency, the Japanese authorities have monitored food contamination closely and implemented protective measures to prevent sale and distribution of contaminated food in Japan
    and outside of Japan.WHO works closely with FAO through the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) to ensure that
    the global community receives the best advice on the matters related to the radioactive contamination in food. Food is still monitored by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan,
 which informs INFOSAN about any residual radioactivity levels in food."
What are the public health lessons learned from the response to Fukushima?,"The Fukushima nuclear accident as a part of a triple disaster was unprecedented in its scale and nature. A number of lessons were learned that help Japan and all countries better plan, prepare, respond and recovery from potential nuclear accidents. These include:Evacuation aims to minimize or prevent health risks of radiation exposure. However the process of evacuation itself, especially under the conditions of a severe natural disaster, may pose serious health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations (such as those with disabilities, older populations, young children).Relocating thousands of people has caused a wide range of health consequences including increase of disaster-related deaths, psychosocial and access to health care issues. Disrupted infrastructure, disconnection of evacuees from their municipalities, reduced number of health workers and failure of local public health and medical systems due to relocation made it more difficult to address these issues.Strengthening of public health services and improving access to health care are key issues for the well-being of evacuees, in addition to mental health and psychological support, behavioral and societal support.Risk communication proved to be essential and should be carried out by trained specialists. Health care workers also need education and training on health effects of radiation."
What was WHO response?,"WHO continues to support Member States in building national capacities for preparedness and response to radiation emergencies and implementing the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005).WHO develops technical tools, training and exercises, promotes international cooperation and provides an information-sharing platform with its Radiation Emergency Medical Preparedness and Assistance Network (REMPAN) and its global network of biodosimetry laboratories (BioDoseNet). Through these partnerships, it contributes to the development, promotion, and harmonization of international radiation safety standards.WHO supports countries to increase their Disaster Risk Management capacities pursuant to the Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction.WHO collaborates with international organizations using the existing inter-agency framework and arrangements under the Joint Radiation Emergency Management Plan of the International Organizations for preparedness for and response to a radiation incident or emergency.WHO continues its efforts towards implementation of the International Basic Safety Standards by promoting international cooperation, harnessing research, providing advice on risk assessment and evidence-based policies development."
What is being done to mitigate the public health impact of the Fukushima accident?,"The Fukushima Health Management Survey (FHMS) is expected to contribute to future health effect assessments. Population health surveillance will permit the identification of additional needs for the delivery of health care. Moreover, as part of the occupational health programmes, a special protocol for medical follow-up of emergency workers is being implemented.To date, the biggest challenge for the mitigation of the public health consequences of the triple disaster is the restoration of the social fabric and social trust. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction post-2015 underlines that response to major disasters should include social mobilization and empowerment of local communities. Community representatives should be involved in the decision-making on protective and restoration actions that would consider the needs and priorities of local communities.Steps towards improving the psycho-social and socio-economic consequences of the disaster should be considered. Health systems need to provide effective counselling services and social support in a team approach and people-centered care. Efforts are needed, both inside and outside Japan, to share the lessons learned from Fukushima around the world.Also see:Towards long-term responses in Fukushima -  The Lancet, vol. 386, Issue 9992, 1–7 August 2015."
How common are headaches?,"Headaches are extremely common. Nearly everyone has a headache 
occasionally. When they occur repeatedly, they are a symptom of a 
headache disorder. The most common headache disorder is tension-type 
headache. In developed countries, tension-type headache affects over one
 third of men and over one half of women. Recent studies suggest the 
same in developing countries. Less well recognized is the toll of 
headache disorders characterized by very frequent headache: up to 1 
adult in 20 has a headache every – or nearly every – day.


		Migraine is also very common affecting at least 1 adult in 
every 7 in the world. It occurs across all continents, but for reasons 
not yet known appears to be somewhat less common in the Far East. It is 
up to 3 times more common in women than men, a pattern seen everywhere. 
This difference is hormonally-driven. Migraine has been better studied 
than other headache disorders. Often starting at puberty, migraine most 
affects those aged between 35 and 45 years but can trouble much younger 
people, including children. Headache disorders are painful and disabling. They can cause 
substantial personal suffering, impaired quality of life and high 
financial cost. Repeated headache attacks – and often the constant fear 
of the next one – can affect family life, social life and employment. 
Despite this, many people – including many health care professionals – 
tend to perceive headache as a minor or trivial complaint. As a result, 
the physical, emotional, social and economic burdens of headaches are 
poorly acknowledged.For the vast majority of people suffering from headache, 
effective treatment requires no expensive equipment, tests or 
specialists. Headache disorders are mostly, and rightly, managed in 
primary health care. The essential components of effective management 
are awareness of the problem, correct diagnosis, avoidance of 
mismanagement, appropriate lifestyle modifications and informed use of 
cost-effective pharmaceutical remedies."
What is genomics?,"Genomics is the study of the total or part of the genetic or 
epigenetic sequence information of organisms, and attempts to understand
 the structure and function of these sequences and of downstream 
biological products. Genomics in health examines the molecular 
mechanisms and the interplay of this molecular information and health 
interventions and environmental factors in disease.
Human genomics is not the only part of genomics relevant
 to human health. The human genome interacts with those of a myriad other 
organisms, including plants, vectors and pathogens. Genomics is 
considered across all organisms, as relevant to public heath in human 
populations. In addition to genomics knowledge, we also considers 
technologies that make use of genomics knowledge.Genomics is distinct from genetics. While genetics is the study of heredity, genomics is defined as the study of genes and their functions, and related techniques.
  		
  		The main difference between genomics and genetics is 
that genetics scrutinizes the functioning and composition of the single 
gene where as genomics addresses all genes and their inter relationships
 in order to identify their combined influence on the growth and 
development of the organism."
What is the potential of genomics for public health?,"The role of human genomics research and related biotechnologies has the potential to
 achieve a number of public health goals, such as to reduce global 
health inequalities by providing developing countries with efficient, 
cost-effective and robust means of preventing, diagnosing and treating 
major diseases that burden their populations.It is a new and rapidly evolving 
branch of science and the full future role of genomics for the provision of 
health care is far from clear. However, it does offer the long-term 
possibility of providing new approaches to the prevention and management
 of many intractable diseases. Hence it is important to prepare society 
for the complexities of this new field, to ensure that its benefits are 
distributed fairly among the countries of the world, and that the 
well-tried and more conventional approaches to medical research and 
practice are not neglected while the medical potential of genomics is 
being explored."
How does genomics relate to global inequality?,"The global burden of disease and other health issues is disproportionately carried by low- and middle-income countries, while many of the emerging treatment options are available largely in wealthier nations. Genomics is affected by this global health imbalance 
and  is currently experiencing a substantial divide that is impeding the
 progress of genetic sciences in low- to middle-income countries. Global
 inequalities in the availability, quality and use of genetic 
technologies, genomic research as well as provision of genomic services 
are widening due to a multitude of reasons. These include a lack of financial resources, lack of health services and 
infrastructure or simply the presence of more compelling health 
priorities as in the case of infectious diseases like TB and HIV/AIDS.  Genome related technologies can contribute to improving global
 health equity. To do so, the genomic health divide must be kept in check
 and ultimately bridged through equitable economic investment, clinical 
research, and provision and use of genomic services and technologies 
globally. The exchange of existing information, expertise and 
technologies between the high income and low-income countries can speed 
up this process. The Human Genetics programme (HGN) provides WHO Member 
States with a clear understanding of the opportunities and challenges 
within genomics that are relevant to the achievement of their respective
 public health targets."
What are genetically modified (GM) organisms and GM foods?,"Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be defined as organisms (i.e. plants, animals or microorganisms) in which the genetic material (DNA) has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination. The technology is often called “modern biotechnology” or “gene technology”, sometimes also “recombinant DNA technology” or “genetic engineering”. It allows selected individual genes to be transferred from one organism into another, also between nonrelated species. Foods produced from or using GM organisms are often referred to as GM foods."
Why are GM foods produced?,"GM foods are developed – and marketed – because there is some perceived advantage either to the producer or consumer of these foods. This is meant to translate into a product with a lower price, greater benefit (in terms of durability or nutritional value) or both. Initially GM seed developers wanted their products to be accepted by producers and have concentrated on innovations that bring direct benefit to farmers (and the food industry generally).
One of the objectives for developing plants based on GM organisms is to improve crop protection. The GM crops currently on the market are mainly aimed at an increased level of crop protection through the introduction of resistance against plant diseases caused by insects or viruses or through increased tolerance towards herbicides.
Resistance against insects is achieved by incorporating into the food plant the gene for toxin production from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). This toxin is currently used as a conventional insecticide in agriculture and is safe for human consumption. GM crops that inherently produce this toxin have been shown to require lower quantities of insecticides in specific situations, e.g. where pest pressure is high. Virus resistance is achieved through the introduction of a gene from certain viruses which cause disease in plants. Virus resistance makes plants less susceptible to diseases caused by such viruses, resulting in higher crop yields.
Herbicide tolerance is achieved through the introduction of a gene from a bacterium conveying resistance to some herbicides. In situations where weed pressure is high, the use of such crops has resulted in a reduction in the quantity of the herbicides used."
Is the safety of GM foods assessed differently from conventional foods?,"Generally consumers consider that conventional foods (that have an established record of safe consumption over the history) are safe. Whenever novel varieties of organisms for food use are developed using the traditional breeding methods that had existed before the introduction of gene technology, some of the characteristics of organisms may be altered, either in a positive or a negative way. National food authorities may be called upon to examine the safety of such conventional foods obtained from novel varieties of organisms, but this is not always the case.
In contrast, most national authorities consider that specific assessments are necessary for GM foods. Specific systems have been set up for the rigorous evaluation of GM organisms and GM foods relative to both human health and the environment. Similar evaluations are generally not performed for conventional foods. Hence there currently exists a significant difference in the evaluation process prior to marketing for these two groups of food.
The WHO Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses aims at assisting national authorities in the identification of foods that should be subject to risk assessment and to recommend appropriate approaches to safety assessment. Should national authorities decide to conduct safety assessment of GM organisms, WHO recommends the use of Codex Alimentarius guidelines (See the answer to Question 11 below)."
How is a safety assessment of GM food conducted?,"The safety assessment of GM foods generally focuses on: (a) direct health effects (toxicity), (b) potential to provoke allergic reaction (allergenicity); (c) specific components thought to have nutritional or toxic properties; (d) the stability of the inserted gene; (e) nutritional effects associated with genetic modification; and (f) any unintended effects which could result from the gene insertion."
What are the main issues of concern for human health?,"While theoretical discussions have covered a broad range of aspects, the three main issues debated are the potentials to provoke allergic reaction (allergenicity), gene transfer and outcrossing.
Allergenicity
As a matter of principle, the transfer of genes from commonly allergenic organisms to non-allergic organisms is discouraged unless it can be demonstrated that the protein product of the transferred gene is not allergenic. While foods developed using traditional breeding methods are not generally tested for allergenicity, protocols for the testing of GM foods have been evaluated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and WHO. No allergic effects have been found relative to GM foods currently on the market.
Gene transfer
Gene transfer from GM foods to cells of the body or to bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract would cause concern if the transferred genetic material adversely affects human health. This would be particularly relevant if antibiotic resistance genes, used as markers when creating GMOs, were to be transferred. Although the probability of transfer is low, the use of gene transfer technology that does not involve antibiotic resistance genes is encouraged.
Outcrossing
The migration of genes from GM plants into conventional crops or related species in the wild (referred to as “outcrossing”), as well as the mixing of crops derived from conventional seeds with GM crops, may have an indirect effect on food safety and food security. Cases have been reported where GM crops approved for animal feed or industrial use were detected at low levels in the products intended for human consumption. Several countries have adopted strategies to reduce mixing, including a clear separation of the fields within which GM crops and conventional crops are grown."
How is a risk assessment for the environment performed?,"Environmental risk assessments cover both the GMO concerned and the potential receiving environment. The assessment process includes evaluation of the characteristics of the GMO and its effect and stability in the environment, combined with ecological characteristics of the environment in which the introduction will take place. The assessment also includes unintended effects which could result from the insertion of the new gene."
What are the issues of concern for the environment?,Issues of concern include: the capability of the GMO to escape and potentially introduce the engineered genes into wild populations; the persistence of the gene after the GMO has been harvested; the susceptibility of non-target organisms (e.g. insects which are not pests) to the gene product; the stability of the gene; the reduction in the spectrum of other plants including loss of biodiversity; and increased use of chemicals in agriculture. The environmental safety aspects of GM crops vary considerably according to local conditions.
Are GM foods safe?,"Different GM organisms include different genes inserted in different ways. This means that individual GM foods and their safety should be assessed on a case-by-case basis and that it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM foods.
GM foods currently available on the international market have passed safety assessments and are not likely to present risks for human health. In addition, no effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of such foods by the general population in the countries where they have been approved. Continuous application of safety assessments based on the Codex Alimentarius principles and, where appropriate, adequate post market monitoring, should form the basis for ensuring the safety of GM foods."
How are GM foods regulated nationally?,"The way governments have regulated GM foods varies. In some countries GM foods are not yet regulated. Countries which have legislation in place focus primarily on assessment of risks for consumer health. Countries which have regulatory provisions for GM foods usually also regulate GMOs in general, taking into account health and environmental risks, as well as control- and trade-related issues (such as potential testing and labelling regimes). In view of the dynamics of the debate on GM foods, legislation is likely to continue to evolve."
What kind of GM foods are on the market internationally?,GM crops available on the international market today have been designed using one of three basic traits: resistance to insect damage; resistance to viral infections; and tolerance towards certain herbicides. GM crops with higher nutrient content (e.g. soybeans increased oleic acid) have been also studied recently.
What happens when GM foods are traded internationally?,"The Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) is the joint FAO/WHO intergovernmental body responsible for developing the standards, codes of practice, guidelines and recommendations that constitute the Codex Alimentarius, meaning the international food code. Codex developed principles for the human health risk analysis of GM foods in 2003.


Principles for the risk analysis of foods derived from modern biotechnology


The premise of these principles sets out a premarket assessment, performed on a caseby- case basis and including an evaluation of both direct effects (from the inserted gene) and unintended effects (that may arise as a consequence of insertion of the new gene) Codex also developed three Guidelines:


Guideline for the conduct of food safety assessment of foods derived from recombinant-DNA plants


Guideline for the conduct of food safety assessment of foods produced using recombinant-DNA microorganisms


Guideline for the conduct of food safety assessment of foods derived from recombinant-DNA animals


Codex principles do not have a binding effect on national legislation, but are referred to specifically in the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures of the World Trade Organization (SPS Agreement), and WTO Members are encouraged to harmonize national standards with Codex standards. If trading partners have the same or similar mechanisms for the safety assessment of GM foods, the possibility that one product is approved in one country but rejected in another becomes smaller.
The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, an environmental treaty legally binding for its Parties which took effect in 2003, regulates transboundary movements of Living Modified Organisms (LMOs). GM foods are within the scope of the Protocol only if they contain LMOs that are capable of transferring or replicating genetic material. The cornerstone of the Protocol is a requirement that exporters seek consent from importers before the first shipment of LMOs intended for release into the environment."
Have GM products on the international market passed a safety assessment?,"The GM products that are currently on the international market have all passed safety assessments conducted by national authorities. These different assessments in general follow the same basic principles, including an assessment of environmental and human health risk. The food safety assessment is usually based on Codex documents."
"Why has there been concern about GM foods among some politicians, public interest groups and consumers?","Since the first introduction on the market in the mid-1990s of a major GM food (herbicide-resistant soybeans), there has been concern about such food among politicians, activists and consumers, especially in Europe. Several factors are involved. In the late 1980s – early 1990s, the results of decades of molecular research reached the public domain. Until that time, consumers were generally not very aware of the potential of this research. In the case of food, consumers started to wonder about safety because they perceive that modern biotechnology is leading to the creation of new species.
Consumers frequently ask, “what is in it for me?”. Where medicines are concerned, many consumers more readily accept biotechnology as beneficial for their health (e.g. vaccines, medicines with improved treatment potential or increased safety). In the case of the first GM foods introduced onto the European market, the products were of no apparent direct benefit to consumers (not significantly cheaper, no increased shelflife, no better taste). The potential for GM seeds to result in bigger yields per cultivated area should lead to lower prices. However, public attention has focused on the risk side of the risk-benefit equation, often without distinguishing between potential environmental impacts and public health effects of GMOs.
Consumer confidence in the safety of food supplies in Europe has decreased significantly as a result of a number of food scares that took place in the second half of the 1990s that are unrelated to GM foods. This has also had an impact on discussions about the acceptability of GM foods. Consumers have questioned the validity of risk assessments, both with regard to consumer health and environmental risks, focusing in particular on long-term effects. Other topics debated by consumer organizations have included allergenicity and antimicrobial resistance. Consumer concerns have triggered a discussion on the desirability of labelling GM foods, allowing for an informed choice of consumers."
What is the state of public debate on GMOs?,"The release of GMOs into the environment and the marketing of GM foods have resulted in a public debate in many parts of the world. This debate is likely to continue, probably in the broader context of other uses of biotechnology (e.g. in human medicine) and their consequences for human societies. Even though the issues under debate are usually very similar (costs and benefits, safety issues), the outcome of the debate differs from country to country. On issues such as labelling and traceability of GM foods as a way to address consumer preferences, there is no worldwide consensus to date. Despite the lack of consensus on these topics, the Codex Alimentarius Commission has made significant progress and developed Codex texts relevant to labelling of foods derived from modern biotechnology in 2011 to ensure consistency on any approach on labelling implemented by Codex members with already adopted Codex provisions."
Are people’s reactions related to the different attitudes to food in various regions of the world?,"Depending on the region of the world, people often have different attitudes to food. In addition to nutritional value, food often has societal and historical connotations, and in some instances may have religious importance. Technological modification of food and food production may evoke a negative response among consumers, especially in the absence of sound risk communication on risk assessment efforts and cost/benefit evaluations."
Are there implications for the rights of farmers to own their crops?,"Yes, intellectual property rights are likely to be an element in the debate on GM foods, with an impact on the rights of farmers. In the FAO/WHO expert consultation in 2003, WHO and FAO have considered potential problems of the technological divide and the unbalanced distribution of benefits and risks between developed and developing countries and the problem often becomes even more acute through the existence of intellectual property rights and patenting that places an advantage on the strongholds of scientific and technological expertise. Such considerations are likely to also affect the debate on GM foods."
Why are certain groups concerned about the growing influence of the chemical industry on agriculture?,"Certain groups are concerned about what they consider to be an undesirable level of control of seed markets by a few chemical companies. Sustainable agriculture and biodiversity benefit most from the use of a rich variety of crops, both in terms of good crop protection practices as well as from the perspective of society at large and the values attached to food. These groups fear that as a result of the interest of the chemical industry in seed markets, the range of varieties used by farmers may be reduced mainly to GM crops. This would impact on the food basket of a society as well as in the long run on crop protection (for example, with the development of resistance against insect pests and tolerance of certain herbicides). The exclusive use of herbicide-tolerant GM crops would also make the farmer dependent on these chemicals. These groups fear a dominant position of the chemical industry in agricultural development, a trend which they do not consider to be sustainable."
What further developments can be expected in the area of GMOs?,"Future GM organisms are likely to include plants with improved resistance against plant disease or drought, crops with increased nutrient levels, fish species with enhanced growth characteristics. For non-food use, they may include plants or animals producing pharmaceutically important proteins such as new vaccines."
What has WHO been doing to improve the evaluation of GM foods?,"WHO has been taking an active role in relation to GM foods, primarily for two reasons:


on the grounds that public health could benefit from the potential of biotechnology, for example, from an increase in the nutrient content of foods, decreased allergenicity and more efficient and/or sustainable food production; and


based on the need to examine the potential negative effects on human health of the consumption of food produced through genetic modification in order to protect public health. Modern technologies should be thoroughly evaluated if they are to constitute a true improvement in the way food is produced.


WHO, together with FAO, has convened several expert consultations on the evaluation of GM foods and provided technical advice for the Codex Alimentarius Commission which was fed into the Codex Guidelines on safety assessment of GM foods. WHO will keep paying due attention to the safety of GM foods from the view of public health protection, in close collaboration with FAO and other international bodies."
What are foodborne diseases?,"Foodborne diseases encompass a wide spectrum of illnesses and are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. They are illnesses associated with the ingestion of food contaminated by bacteria, viruses, parasites and chemicals as well as bio-toxins."
What are some examples of foodborne diseases?,"Foodborne diseases can be caused: by micro-organisms (e.g. salmonella, campylobacter, enterohaemorrhagic E. Coli, listeria, cholera); by parasites (e.g. fasciola, echinococcus, taenia solium); by chemical agents and bio-toxins such as: - naturally-occurring toxins (e.g. mycotoxins, which are toxins in fungi), - persistant organic pollutants (i.e. pollutants that accumulate in the environment and human bodies) ; - metals (which accumulate in food e.g. lead, mercury, cadmium); and - unconventional agents (e.g. the agent that caused bovine spongiform encephalopathy - also known as ""mad cow disease"")."
How widespread are foodborne diseases?,"Foodborne diseases are a widespread and growing public health problem, both in developed and developing countries. In 2000 the World Health Assembly recognized that the prevention and control of foodborne diseases is an important public health issue (resolution WHA53.15). While most foodborne diseases are sporadic and often not reported, foodborne disease outbreaks may take on massive proportions. For example, the current Salmonella Saintpaul outbreak in the United States affected 43 out of 50 states in the country. The melamine-contaminated dairy products in China affected over 54,000 children. The WHO Global Burden of Disease: Update 2004 has estimated that 2.16 million children die every year from diarrhoeal diseases as a result of exposure to unsafe water, food, and poor sanitation and hygiene. However the proportion of these deaths that is attributable to eating unsafe food is not currently known. Additionally, diarrhoea is a major cause of malnutrition in infants and young children."
What is the situation regarding foodborne diseases in developed and developing countries?,"In some industrialized countries, the percentage of the population suffering from foodborne diseases each year is estimated to be up to 30%.  While less well documented, developing countries bear the brunt of the problem. People living in developing countries are more likely to be exposed to unhealthy environments through:Poor access to clean water to adequately wash food items Unsafe transportation and/or inadequate storage of foods Insufficient knowledge of safe food processing and handling practices   Compromised immune responses to foodborne infections, particularly in populations where malnutrition and HIV/AIDS are prevalentThis is compounded by poor countries' limited capacity to enforce effective food safety measures, including:Efficient foodborne disease surveillance and monitoring systems Food safety regulations and functioning inspection systemsFood safety education programs and Effective emergency planning and relief. The high prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases in many developing countries, including those caused by parasites, points out the urgent need to prioritize foodborne disease prevention and control in national health and development plans.  The full picture of the impact and costs of foodborne diseases - in industrial just as in developing countries - is to date unknown. Many foodborne disease outbreaks go unrecognized, unreported or uninvestigated and may only be visible if connected to situations that have a major public health or economic impact. In order to fill this current data vacuum, the WHO Department of Food Safety, Zoonoses and Foodborne Diseases (FOS) together with its partners launched the Initiative to Estimate the Global Burden of Foodborne Diseases."
How do foodborne diseases challenge public health security?,"Many recent developments have accelerated the spread of foodborne diseases worldwide: 1) In today’s interconnected and interdependent world, local foodborne disease outbreaks have become a potential threat to the entire globe. 2) Both accidentally and deliberately contaminated food products can affect the health of people in many countries at the same time, as well as causing considerable economic losses from lost production and trade embargoes, and damage to a country's tourist industry.  3) Foodborne diseases are not only spreading faster, they also appear to be emerging more rapidly than ever before1 and are able to circumvent conventional control measures. 4) The growing industrialization of food production catalyses the appearance and spread of new pathogens, as was the case for prions associated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) which led to new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans in the United Kingdom during the 1990s. The increasing resistance of pathogens to antibiotics is also a major problem."
What are the health risks associated with pesticide residues in food?,"Pesticides are chemicals used in agriculture to protect crops 
against insects, fungi, weeds and other pests. In addition to their use 
in agriculture, pesticides are also used to protect public health in 
controlling the vectors of tropical diseases, such as mosquitoes.But pesticides are also potentially toxic to humans. They may 
induce adverse health effects including cancer, effects on reproduction,
 immune or nervous systems. Before they can be authorized for use, 
pesticides should be tested for all possible health effects and the 
results should be analysed by experts to assess any risks to humans."
“Hazard” and “risk”: what is the difference?,"Scientific studies of the potential health effects of 
hazardous chemicals, such as pesticides, allow them to be classified as 
carcinogenic (can cause cancer), neurotoxic (can cause damage to the 
brain), or teratogenic (can cause damage to a fetus). This process of 
classification, called “hazard identification,” is the first step of 
“risk assessment”. An example of hazard identification is the 
classification of substances according to their carcinogenicity to 
humans carried out by the International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC), the specialized cancer agency of WHO.The same chemical can have different effects at different 
doses, which depends on how much of the chemical a person is exposed to.
 It can also depend on the route by which the exposure occurs, e.g. 
ingestion, inhalation or injection."
Why does WHO have 2 distinct processes for “hazard identification” and “risk assessment”?,"“Hazard identification”—in particular, the IARC classification
 of substances in terms of their carcinogenicity—is the first step of 
the “risk assessment” process. Classification of an agent as a 
carcinogenic hazard is an important indication that some level of 
exposure, for example from occupation, environment, food, etc., could 
result in an increased risk of cancer.Risk assessment for pesticide residues in food, as conducted 
by the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR), establishes a
 safe intake level after assessing the level of risk. Acceptable daily 
intakes (ADIs) are used by governments and international risk managers, 
such as the Codex Alimentarius Commission, to establish maximum residue 
limits (MRLs) for pesticides in food. MRLs are enforced by national 
authorities to ensure that the amount of pesticide residues consumers 
are exposed to through eating food over a lifetime will not have adverse
 health effects.IARC’s hazard identification can inform the JMPR’s risk 
assessment, and thus the two processes can be complementary. For 
example, IARC may identify new evidence from scientific studies on the 
carcinogenicity of a chemical and, when necessary, JMPR conducts an 
evaluation or a re-evaluation of the safety of that chemical as it is 
used in agriculture and occurs in food."
What are persistent organic pollutants (POPs)?,"Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are chemicals of global concern due to their potential for long-range transport, persistence in the environment, ability to bio-magnify and bio-accumulate in ecosystems, as well as their significant negative effects on human health and the environment. The most commonly encountered POPs are organochlorine pesticides, such as DDT, industrial chemicals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) as well as unintentional by-products of many industrial processes, especially polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and dibenzofurans (PCDF), commonly known as dioxins."
How are people exposed to POPs?,"Humans are exposed to these chemicals in a variety of ways: mainly through the food we eat, but also through the air we breathe, in the outdoors, indoors and at the workplace. Many products used in our daily lives may contain POPs, which have been added to improve product characteristics, such as flame retardants or surfactants. As a result, POPs can be found virtually everywhere on our planet in measurable concentrations.POPs bio-magnify throughout the food chain and bio-accumulate in organisms. The highest concentrations of POPs are thus found in organisms at the top of the food chain. Consequently, background levels of POPs can be found in the human body.Human exposure - for some compounds and scenarios, even to low levels of POPs - can lead to many health effects including increased cancer risk, reproductive disorders, alteration of the immune system, neurobehavioural impairment, endocrine disruption, genotoxicity and increased birth defects."
Are POPs found in breastmilk?,"Through its GEMS/Food Programme, WHO has collected and evaluated information
on levels of persistent organic pollutants in foods, including breastmilk,
since 1976. Over the period 1987-2003, it has coordinated three international
studies of breastmilk to assess the levels and trends of polychlorinated
dibenzodioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans and dioxin-like polychlorinated
biphenyls. Analysis of breastmilk, maternal blood and adipose tissue are all
relevant matrices for assessment of body burdens for persistent organic
pollutants. However, breastmilk is recognized as the preferred matrix because
has several important advantages. Biomonitoring of breastmilk data can provide
information on the exposure of the mother as well as the infants. Furthermore,
such information provides guidance on the need for measures to reduce levels of
this substances in food, which is the main source of exposures for most people.
More recently, it has been recognized that breastmilk is an ideal matrix to
generally monitor levels of persistent organic pollutants in the environment. In 2004, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants was
ratified by governments to decrease environmental and human exposure to twelve
priority substances in this class. The revised WHO guidelines for developing a
national protocol describe the basic study design that can be used to monitor
human exposure over time in order to, among other things, see if the Stockholm
agreement is actually effective in reducing the release of these chemicals into
the environment. These guidelines continue to support the monitoring of
persistent organic contaminants for human health and food-chain contamination
purposes. The protocol was designed based on the advice of experts in the field
(see ad hoc WHO Breastmilk Survey Advisory Group) and on extensive experience
of certain countries in undertaking similar surveys using human samples,
including breastmilk. In order to promote reliability and comparability,
participating countries are encouraged to adhere as closely to this protocol as
possible. Ethical issues, including informed consent of donors and
confidentiality, are major considerations in this protocol. Given that
breastfeeding reduces child mortality and has health benefits that extend into
adulthood, every effort has been made to protect, promote and support
breastfeeding in the context of these studies."
Are PCBs and dioxins found in salmonour food supply?,"A survey reported in the journal Science (09 January 2004) compared
the level of organochlorine contaminants, including PCBs and dioxins, in farmed
versus wild salmon collected from around the world. Most organochlorine
substances analysed in the study show a significantly higher level of
contamination in farmed than in wild salmon.This study is the largest conducted so far, in particular relating to the
direct comparison between farmed and wild salmon. The results reported
specifically for dioxins and PCBs are well within the range of previous
studies. Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds are important substances that can
affect human health. They are persistent environmental pollutants that enrich
via the food chain. Dioxins and PCBs are associated with industrial discharges,
including discharges into the sea, and ocean fish have varying levels of these
substances often directly related to the proximity of their habitat to
discharge areas. The level in farmed fish normally reflects the contamination
level of the feed used, which has been also shown in above mentioned study by
the detection of dioxins and PCBs in commercial fish feed."
Is it safe to consume foods contaminated with POPs?,"WHO, in collaboration with FAO, has considered dioxins and dioxin-like
compounds on several occasions. Most recently in June 2001, the Joint FAO/WHO
Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) examined new evidence on the
toxicity of these chemicals and established a Provisional Tolerable Monthly
Intake (PTMI) of 70 picograms of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. When evaluating
standard diets in different parts of the world the results indicated that the
estimated intakes of these chemicals approach or exceed this PTMI. Based on the
mean contamination levels reported in above study, eating one or two portions
per week of farmed salmon would result in a monthly intake below this level.
However, an overall dietary risk assessment would require inclusion of other
dietary sources of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs."
What is being done to prevent POPs contamination?,"To address the risks associated with these substances, several steps have
been taken to reduce or eliminate emissions of dioxins, dioxin-like PCBs and
other related persistent organic pollutants. Many countries have now
implemented the Stockholm Convention on POPs (2001), which suggests ending
commercial use of 12 POPs and reduce or eliminate their emission into the
environment. To monitor reduction in human exposure WHO and UNEP run a
monitoring program for POPs in breastmilk. A steady decline in levels has been
observed since 1980 for most countries.In regard to food contamination, the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission,
which is a risk management body comprised of 169 member countries, is
developing a draft code of practice for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in food,
which identifies source-directed measures to reduce their presence in food,
including fish, as well as a position paper, which provides an evaluation of
the need for possible regulatory measures, such as limits in food and feed.The results of this new study in salmon and other studies should be used to
maintain the focus on reducing the exposure of humans to dioxins and
dioxin-like PCBs. Specifically, efforts to reduce the level of such substances
in animals used for human consumption should be actively supported, in
particular source-directed measures such as reduction of contamination levels
in animal feed.FAO and WHO consider fish to be an important component of a nutritious diet,
and that the risk of consuming contaminated fish must be weighted in view of
the beneficial nutritive effects of fish. FAO and WHO plan to develop general
guidance for such risk-benefit considerations, with the contamination of fish
as case studies."
What are toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) for dioxins and similar compounds?,"Dioxins occur as a complex mixture in the environment and in food. More than
90% of human exposure is through food, mainly meat and dairy products, fish and
shellfish. In order to assess the potential health risk of the whole mixture, the
concept of toxic equivalence has been applied to this group of structurally and
biologically related contaminants. TCDD, the most toxic member of the family,
is used as reference compound, and all other dioxins are assigned a toxic
potency relative to TCDD, based on experimental studies. These international
TEFs have been developed for application in risk assessment and management, and
have been adopted formally for regulatory purposes by a number of countries and
regional bodies, including Canada, the European Union, Japan and the United
States of America.During the last 15 years, WHO, through the International Programme on
Chemical Safety (IPCS), has established and regularly re-evaluated toxic
equivalency factors (TEFs) for dioxins and related compounds through expert
consultations. WHO-TEF values have been established in 1998 which apply to
humans, mammals, birds and fish. The last consultation was held in 2005 to
update human and mammalian TEFs. Details on the process and outcome can be
found through the links below."
1. What can WHO do as a GCF Readiness Delivery Partner?,"Readiness Delivery Partners provide services such as: support to NDAs in the development of readiness request proposals; implementation and supervision; financial management; progress reporting; and project completion and evaluation.WHO can support countries in developing readiness proposals in cooperation with NDAs and implementing readiness activities for health such as conducting a health vulnerability and adaptation assessment, developing the health component of the national adaptation plan (H-NAP), assessing the health co-benefits of mitigation, the development of a full project proposal or any other health priority issues as agreed with the NDA."
2. Can a Readiness Delivery Partner develop and implement full GCF projects?,"Full project proposals (not readiness proposals) must be developed by a GCF Accredited Entity (AE). WHO is currently not an AE of the GCF.  WHO can assist with the development of full project proposals for submission to GCF (although not as part of a readiness proposal) and implement activities as part of a GCF-funded project, however, an AE is responsible for project proposal submission and then managing the overall project."
3. What is the funding cap for WHO as a Readiness Delivery Partner?,"Funding caps are applied depending on the results of the Financial Management Capacity Assessment (FMCA) where the track record of the delivery partner is analyzed. Currently, there is no funding cap for WHO as a Delivery Partner, so for any project for which WHO is a delivery partner the funding caps for that country will apply.The only funding caps that applies are related to the specific countries: the USD 3 million per country cap on support for adaptation planning (Objective 3) and the annual cap of USD 1 million per country. These two caps work independently of each other. The USD 1 million cap is applied on approvals per calendar year, not implementation period. For example, in 2020, a country may be approved for Grant A of USD 1 million with an 18-month implementation term ending in 2021. That country would not be able to access another readiness grant under the USD 1 million cap system in 20202. However, in 20201, they could submit Grant B for up to USD 1 million for an implementation term concurrent, at least in part, with Grant A."
4. Who needs to submit the GCF readiness proposal?,"The readiness proposal must be submitted by the country’s NDA and as such, it is very important to have the NDA’s support at an early stage, ideally at proposal conceptualization.  It is equally important to ensure that the proposal is developed in partnership with the Ministry of Health (or equivalent Government department) and other relevant Government counterparts.  For proposals in which WHO is the delivery partner, WHO Headquarters (HQ), ), specifically the Assistant Director General for the Division of Healthier Populations, is the appropriate contact point for section 1.4 of the readiness template. Other relevant WHO contacts may also be added in section 1.4 in addition to HQ. Please also include [email protected] in your email correspondence."
5. If WHO is the readiness delivery partner who will receive the funds?,WHO HQ will receive funds directly from the GCF. The funding transfer to country offices will depend on the implementation arrangement of the approved proposal and only allowed when such arrangements have been approved by the GCF.
6. Who has responsibility for the implementation of approved readiness activities?,"The role of a delivery partner of any approved readiness activities is the implementation of the said activities. Hence, if WHO is the selected and approved readiness delivery partner for that specific proposal, WHO will be responsible for ensuring the activities are implemented as outlined in the proposal.  However, to ensure effective delivery of proposal activities it is crucial that the proposal is developed in partnership with the Ministry of Health (or equivalent Government department) and the NDA."
7. What are the first steps in developing a readiness proposal?,"As a starting point for readiness proposal development, please consider the following steps (these steps are provided as a suggestion, however, the actual process will depend on the country context):Identify the needs of the health sector in relation to climate change. If your country’s action plans have been already established, such plans could serve a good reference point;Review the with the GCF Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme Guidebook to match your country needs with eligible activities for the Readiness Programme;In partnership with the Ministry of Health (MoH) formulate the needs and categorize them into one or more of the five relevant funding objectives listed above;With the MoH, inform your NDA that WHO is now a delivery partner of Readiness Programme and communicate the identified needs to the NDA;Undertake a trilateral discussion between NDA, WHO and GCF Secretariat (Regional Officers in DCP) on the potential proposal. This communication should be ongoing throughout the proposal development process;Determine the NDA’s interest in the proposed activities and, with the MoH, discuss the opportunity for WHO to access readiness funds could be accessed as a delivery partner;Check with the NDA the availability of readiness funds under the two funding options, considering other readiness proposals that have been submitted or are under development;Complete the required documentation (listed in the readiness proposal template) in partnership with the MoH and any other partners and provide to the NDA for submission."
8. What are the deadlines for submitting a readiness proposal?,"There are no deadlines for submitting a proposal to access the USD 3 million one-time funding bucket for NAP/adaptation planning.For access to the USD 1 million per year (i.e. all non-NAP (/H-NAP) proposals), there are submission cycles with the following deadlines:Submissions against 2020 annual caps:2nd submission cycle deadline:        31 March 20203rd submission cycle deadline:         30 June 20204th submission cycle      deadline:    31 August 2020       The submission cycles are only indicative timelines for GCF and the approval of the proposal is subject to the quality of submission. The final 4th submission cycle deadline is the final deadline to submit proposals to be eligible to be counted against the 2020 Readiness cap. The Secretariat will make every effort to process, review, and approve Readiness proposals submitted by the 31 August deadline to fall under 2020 Readiness caps. Proposals will be counted against the annual cap for 2020 or 2021 according to the date they are approved, not the date they are submitted."
9. Does the funding for a readiness proposal count towards the funding limit of the year the proposal is submitted or the year that it is approved (if they are different)?,"The year it is approved.  For example, if a country submits a readiness proposal in June 2020 but it is not approved until January 2021 it will be part of the USD 1 million cap for 2021."
10. What is the usual approval timeframe from the date of proposal submission?,"The GCF Secretariat aims to process approval of all readiness grants within 90 business days from submission date.  For National Adaptation Plan (NAP)/adaptation planning proposals, the GCF Secretariat aims to approve proposals in 110 business days.  However, this does not count the time required for revisions to proposals by the Nationally Designated Authority and/or delivery partner.  On average, for regular readiness proposals, the time from submission to first tranche disbursement is 180 – 200 days."
11. Can we engage multiple delivery partners for a readiness project?,"No, there must be a lead delivery partner that is responsible for the project.  However, where further expertise and/or services are required, other partners may be engaged through established, transparent procurement processes."
What is risk communication?,"Risk communication refers to the real-time exchange of information, advice and opinions between experts or officials and people who face a threat (hazard) to their survival, health or economic or social well-being. Its ultimate purpose is that everyone at risk is able to take informed decisions to mitigate the effects of the threat (hazard) such as a disease outbreak and take protective and preventive action.Risk communication uses many communications techniques ranging from media and social media communications to mass communications and stakeholder and community engagement. It requires the understanding of stakeholder perceptions, concerns and beliefs, as well as their knowledge and practices. Effective risk communication must also identify early on and subsequently manage rumours, misinformation and other communications challenges."
Why is risk communication important?,"Risk communication refers to the real-time exchange of information, advice and opinions between experts or officials and people who face a threat (hazard) to their survival, health or economic or social well-being. Its ultimate purpose is that everyone at risk is able to take informed decisions to mitigate the effects of the threat (hazard) such as a disease outbreak and take protective and preventive action.Risk communication uses many communications techniques ranging from media and social media communications to mass communications and stakeholder and community engagement. It requires the understanding of stakeholder perceptions, concerns and beliefs, as well as their knowledge and practices. Effective risk communication must also identify early on and subsequently manage rumours, misinformation and other communications challenges."
How does risk communication work?,"Risk communication only works when there is communication based on trust between those who know (experts), those in charge (authorities) and those affected. Without trust, people are unlikely to follow the advice given. Listening to and understanding peoples’ beliefs, concerns and perceptions is just as important as providing them with facts and advice.Explaining honestly what is known and admitting what is uncertain is essential. The credibility of those giving advice; their expressions of caring and empathy; and identifying with the audience are factors that make risk communication effective."
What help can countries get to improve their capacity to communicate risk during emergencies?,"Countries report that they have made progress in risk communication capacity over recent years. However, as health emergencies become increasingly complex, as witnessed during the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa and in the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus, more help is being requested from WHO and partners.WHO provides global guidance on best practices for risk communication and is supporting countries to build up capacities through establishing the right policy, strategy and plans for risk communication, providing training for key personnel, engaging and training journalists on how to report on health emergencies, and running simulation exercises to test national systems. In emergencies, WHO provides hands on support for response by deploying its Emergency Communications Network to affected countries and regions to work hand-in-hand with national and local authorities."
Do dead bodies pose health risk?,"Contrary to popular belief, dead bodies pose no more risk of disease outbreak in the aftermath of a natural disaster than survivors.In natural disasters, cadavers pose no threat of disease - September 23, 2004Dead bodies do not pose health risk in natural disasters (BNJ) - June 5, 2004Management of dead bodies after disaster situations"
Are epidemics and plagues inevitable after every disaster?,Epidemics do not spontaneously occur after a disaster and dead bodies will not lead to catastrophic outbreaks of exotic diseases. The key to preventing disease is to improve sanitary conditions and educate the public.
Is the fastest way to dispose of bodies and avoid the spread of disease through mass burials or cremations?,This can help create a sense of relief among survivors. Survivors will feel more at peace and manage their sense of loss better if they are allowed to follow their beliefs and religious practices and if they are able to identify and recover the remains of their loved ones.Source: WHO/PAHO Myths and Realities in the Management of Dead Bodies
Is it possible to identify large number of bodies after a tragedy?,Conditions always exist that allow for the identification of bodies or body parts.Source: WHO/PAHO Myths and Realities in the Management of Dead Bodies
Are DNA techniques for identifying bodies not available in most countries due to its high cost and technological requirements?,"This technology is rapidly becoming accessible to all countries. Furthermore, in the case of major disasters, most countries can count on external financial and technological support including DNA technology.Source: WHO/PAHO Myths and Realities in the Management of Dead Bodies"
Is kind of international assistance needed?,A hasty response that is not based on an impartial evaluation only contributes to the chaos. It is better to wait until genuine needs have been assessed.
Do disasters bring out the worst in human behaviour?,"Although isolated cases of antisocial behaviour exist, the majority of people respond spontaneously and generously."
Are the affected populations too shocked and helpless to take responsibility for their own survival?,"On the contrary, many find new strength during an emergency, as evidenced by the thousands of volunteers who spontaneously unite to sift through the rubble in search of victims after an earthquake."
Are disasters random killers?,"Disasters strike hardest at the most vulnerable group, the poor -- especially women, children and the elderly."
Is locating disaster victims in temporary settlements the best alternative?,"It should be the last alternative. Many agencies use funds normally spent for tents to purchase building materials, tools, and other construction-related support in the affected country."
Do things get back to normal in a few days?,The effects of a disaster last a long time. Disaster-affected countries deplete much of their financial and material resources in the immediate post-impact phase. Successful relief programs gear their operations to the fact that international interest wanes as needs and shortages become more pressing.
Do starving people eat anything?,"It is widely held that people who are starving will be very hungry and eat any food that can be supplied. This attitude is inhumane and incorrect. Even if hungry initially, people often do not consume adequate quantities of unvaried and unfamiliar foods for long enough. More importantly, the starving people are often ill and may not have a good appetite. They will therefore languish in an emaciated state or get even sicker.Even someone well-nourished would fail to thrive on the monotonous diets of three or so commodities (e.g. wheat, beans and oil) that is all that is available, month in, month out, to many refugees and displaced people. And this is aside from the micro-nutrient deficiencies that often develop. This misconception starts, in part, from a failure to agree on explict objectives for food assistance -- which should surely be to provide for health, welfare, and a reasonably decent existence and help in attaining and acceptable state of self-reliance and self-respect. Source: Lancet, Vol. 340, Nov 28, 1992"
Should children with diarrhoea should be intensively fed?,"A view from many years ago, and from non-emergency situations, sometimes persists -- namely, that children must be rehydrated (and diarrhoea prevented) before re-feeding. This policy is incorrect and, with severely malnourished children, it can be fatal. Any child with diarrhoea must be fed, if necessary with a liquid diet by nasogastric tube, at the same time as additional fluids are given. Even if the diarrhoea is profuse, some nutrients are absorbed and can start the recovery process. To begin feeding after rehydration will often be too late. Source: Lancet, Vol. 340, Nov 28, 1992"
Do refugees manage with less?,"This misconception dehumanizes the refugee. It implies that, once uprooted, he or she no longer has the basic human rights to food, shelter and care - that these are now offered as charitable acts and that refugees can (or should) make do on much less than non-refugees.In fact they will often need more than their normal food requirement at first if they have become malnourished and sick before arrival at a camp and need rehabilitation; and may suffer exposure from inadequate shelter. If the only food source is provided by camp organizers, these rations have to be adequate in all nutrients. This requires a mixed food basket, including fruits and vegetables. If this cannot be ensured then trading may have to be encouraged if refugees are not to become undernourished and deficient in micro-nutrients. The fact that some foods may be traded, to add variety to the diet, is no grounds for reducing the ration. Source: Lancet, Vol. 340, Nov 28, 1992"
Does trading foods indicate that people do not need all of the rations?,"If the only food source is provided by camp organizers, these rations have to be adequate in all nutrients. This requires a mixed food basket, including fruits and vegetables. If this cannot be ensured then trading may have to be encouraged if refugees are not to become undernourished and deficient in micro-nutrients. The fact that some foods may be traded, to add variety to the diet, is no grounds for reducing the ration. Source: Lancet, Vol. 340, Nov 28, 1992"
Is a standard ration suitable for all populations?,"The recommended per caput calorie output for a refugee population should vary according to demographic composition, nutritional and health status of the population (allowing for an extra ""catch-up"" allowance where people are malnourished), the activity level the intake is intended to support, environmental temperature, and likely wastage in the chain from supply of food in a country to its consumption by individuals.In other words there is a range of requirements for dietary energy, which will depend on the circumstances, and use of a single figure is likely to lead to either deficit or wastage. The figure of 1900 kcal (commonly assumed to be of general application) often underestimates what is needed. Source: Lancet, Vol. 340, Nov 28, 1992"
Does energy adequacy mean nutritional adequacy?,"The diet needs to be adequate in both quantity and quality, meeting requirements for calories, protein, and micro-nutrients. Where refugees are completely dependent on the ration provided -- for example, in the early stages of an emergency or in closed camps, where trading for diversity cannot be ensured -- the ration must be designed to meet the requirements of all nutrients in full.Often, a ration is designed to meet minimum energy requirements and micro-nutrients are left to look after themselves. How micro-nutrient needs are to be met must be made explicit, especially when the ration provided is calculated on the basis of fully meeting energy needs. Foods should be diverse and palatable, and the special needs of weaning children must be met."
Do disasters cause deaths at random?,"Disasters tend to take a higher toll on the most vulnerable geographic areas (high-risk areas), generally those settled by the poorest people.Source: WHO/PAHO Myths and Realities in the Management of Dead Bodies"
Is it best to limit information on the magnitude of the tragedy?,"Restricting access to information creates a lack of confidence in the population, which can lead to misconduct and even violence.Source: WHO/PAHO Myths and Realities in the Management of Dead Bodies"
What are the International Health Regulations?,"The International Health Regulations (2005), or IHR (2005), represents a binding international legal agreement involving 196 countries across the globe, including all the Member States of WHO. Their aim is to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide. The purpose and scope of the IHR (2005) is to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade."
How does the IHR Emergency Committee work?,"The Emergency Committee is made up of international experts who provide technical advice to the WHO Director-General in the context of a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) The Committee provides views on:whether the event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC);the Temporary Recommendations that should be taken by the country experiencing an emergency of international concern, or by other countries, to prevent or reduce the international spread of disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international trade and travel; andthe termination of a PHEIC.The Director-General makes the final determination of a PHEIC and Temporary Recommendations to address the situation, based on advice from the Emergency Committee, information provided by the State Parties, scientific experts and an assessment of risk to human health, risk of international spread of disease and of risk of interference with international travel.Under the IHR (2005), Temporary Recommendations automatically expire three months after their issuance. Emergency Committees are therefore reconvened at least every 3 months to review the current epidemiological situation and to review whether the event continues to be a public health emergency of international concern and whether changes need to be made to the Temporary Recommendations. A statement of the Emergency Committee meeting is published on the WHO website after each meeting of the Committee."
What is a public health emergency of international concern?,"A PHEIC is defined in the IHR (2005) as, “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response”. This definition implies a situation that is:serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected;carries implications for public health beyond the affected State’s national border; andmay require immediate international action."
Who are the members of an IHR Emergency Committee?,"Members of an IHR Emergency Committee are drawn from the IHR Experts Roster, established by the Director-General, and, where appropriate, from other WHO expert advisory panels. The IHR Expert Roster is composed of international experts in fields such as disease control, virology, vaccine development or infectious disease epidemiology.Members can be selected on the basis of expertise required for any particular session. At least 1 member of the Emergency Committee should be an expert nominated by a State Party within whose territory the event arises. These States Parties are invited to present their views to the Emergency Committee. The Director-General may also appoint 1 or more technical experts to advise the Committee, on his or her own initiative or at the request of the Committee.Persons who are neither members of the IHR Experts Roster nor other WHO Expert Advisory Panels could be appointed as technical experts to advise the Committee, but not as members of the Committee.The names of members and advisers to an IHR Emergency Committee, their job titles and any other information that could be determined to be a potential conflict of interest are published on WHO’s website."
How are the members of an IHR Emergency Committee chosen?,"Selection of members is based primarily on their technical ability and experience in the relevant fields of expertise. The Director-General aims to ensure that members of the IHR Emergency Committee have the broadest possible geographical representation and reflect diverse knowledge, practical experience and approaches. Achieving gender balance is also a desirable aim.Members of WHO advisory panels and committees do not receive any remuneration from the Organization."
How are people appointed to the expert advisory panels?,"A member of an expert advisory panel is an expert appointed by the DG.An expert advisory panel may be established by the DG in any field, as and when required by the development of the Organization’s programme.Any person possessing qualifications and/or experience relevant and useful to the activities of the Organization in a field covered by an established expert advisory panel may be considered for appointment as a member of that panel – after consultations with the national authorities concerned."
Are e-cigarettes and other vaping products dangerous?,"There are many different types of e-cigarettes.  E-cigarettes are the most common form of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS) but there are others, such as e-cigars, e-pipes, etc. ENDS contain varying amounts of nicotine and harmful emissions.E-cigarette emissions typically contain nicotine and other toxic substances that are harmful to both users, and non-users who are exposed to the aerosols secondhand. Some products claiming to be nicotine-free have been found to contain nicotine.Evidence reveals that these products are harmful to health and are not safe. However, it is too early to provide a clear answer on the long-term impact of using them or being exposed to them. They are particularly risky when used by children and adolescents. Nicotine is highly addictive and young people’s brains develop up to their mid-twenties. Exposure to nicotine of children and adolescents can have long-lasting, damaging effects on brain development and there is risk of nicotine addiction. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence in some settings that never-smoker minors who use ENDS at least double their chance of starting to smoke conventional tobacco cigarettes later in life. ENDS use increases the risk of heart disease and lung disorders.  They also pose significant risks to pregnant women who use them, as they can damage the growing fetus.ENDS also expose non-smokers and bystanders to nicotine and other harmful chemicals.Exposure of children to ENDS liquid continues to pose serious risks. There is a risk of the devices leaking, or of children swallowing the liquid, and ENDS have been known to cause serious injuries, including burns, through fires and explosions."
Do e-cigarettes (ENDS) cause lung injuries?,"There is growing evidence that ENDS could be associated with lung injuries and in recent times e-cigarette and vaping have been linked to an outbreak of lung injury in the USA.  This is described by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as ‘e-cigarette or vaping associated lung injury’ (EVALI), which led the CDC to activate an emergency investigation into EVALI on 17 September 2019. The CDC says “as of 14 January 2020, there have been a total of 2,668 cases of EVALI reported from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, including 60 deaths confirmed in 27 states and the District of Columbia. Among 2,022 hospitalized cases with information on substances used, 1,650 (82%) reported using any THC-containing product, and 1,162 (57%) reported using any nicotine-containing product; 669 (33%) reported exclusive THC-containing product use, and 274 (14%) reported exclusive nicotine-containing product use.”  Further information on this incident, including a strong link of the EVALI outbreak to Vitamin E Acetate and the latest report, is available at https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html, which is updated every week, as the evidence is not sufficient to exclude the contribution of other chemicals. At least five other countries have initiated investigations to identify cases of lung injuries related to the EVALI cases reported in the US."
Are e-cigarettes more or less dangerous than conventional tobacco cigarettes?,"It is difficult to generalize on the risk to health of ENDS as compared with cigarettes or other tobacco products, as this is contingent on a range of factors.Both tobacco products and ENDS pose risks to health.  The safest approach is not to use either.The levels of risk associated with using ENDS and/or tobacco products are likely to depend on a range of factors, some relating to the products used
    and some to the individual user. Factors include: product type and characteristics, how the products are used, including frequency of use, how the products are manufactured, who is using the product, and whether product characteristics are manipulated
    post-sale.Toxicity is not the only factor in considering risk to an individual or a population from exposure to ENDS emissions. These factors may include the potential for abusing or manipulating the product, use by children and adolescents
    who otherwise would not have used cigarettes, simultaneous use with other tobacco products (dual or poly use) and children and adolescents going on to use smoked products following experimentation with ENDS.  Further, not all ENDS are the same
    and the risks to health may differ from one product to another, and from user to user."
Are ENDS addictive?,"ENDS contain nicotine, which is highly addictive, and ENDS use involves the inhalation of a nicotine-infused aerosol."
Are secondhand ENDS emissions dangerous?,The aerosols generated by ENDS typically contain toxic substances. ENDS pose risks to both users and non-users.
What are the policy options for regulating ENDS?,"How a country approaches ENDS will depend on factors particular to its situation. ENDS are currently banned in over 30 countries worldwide. In others they are regulated as consumer products, as pharmaceutical products, as tobacco products, other categories or totally unregulated. Where they are not banned, WHO recommends that ENDS be regulated. Regulatory objectives include: Preventing initiation of ENDS use by non-smokers and children, such as by preventing or restricting advertising, promotion and sponsorship, and restricting flavours that appeal to children  Minimizing as far as possible potential health and/or risks to ENDS users, such as by regulating product characteristics Protecting non-users from exposure to their emissions, such as by prohibiting ENDS use in indoor spaces where smoking is not permittedPreventing unproven health claimsProtecting public health policies from commercial and other vested interests"
What role do ENDS play in smoking cessation?,"The scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of ENDS as a smoking cessation aid is still being debated. To date, in part due to the diversity of ENDS products and the low certainty surrounding many studies, the potential for ENDS to play a role as a population-level tobacco cessation intervention is unclear. To truly help tobacco users quit and to strengthen global tobacco control, governments need to scale up policies and interventions that we know work. Tried and tested interventions, such as brief advice from health professionals, national toll free quit lines and cessation interventions delivered via mobile text messaging is recommended. Where economically feasible, governments should also consider promoting nicotine replacement therapies and non-nicotine pharmacotherapies for cessation."
What is WHO doing about ENDS?,"WHO regularly monitors and reviews the evidence on ENDS and health and offers guidance to governments. This includes the biennial WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic, which tracks the status of the tobacco epidemic and interventions to combat it and other relevant resources. WHO strives to build a safer, healthier world for everyone, everywhere."

What is echinococcosis ?,"Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease that occurs in two main forms in humans: cystic echinococcosis (also known as hydatidosis) and alveolar echinococcosis, caused by the tapeworms Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis, respectively.
Dogs, foxes and other carnivores harbour the adult worms in their intestine and evacuate the parasite eggs in their faeces. If the eggs are ingested by humans, they develop into larvae in several organs, mainly the liver and lungs.
Both cystic and alveolar echinococcosis are characterized by asymptomatic incubation periods that can last many years until the parasite larvae evolve and trigger clinical signs.
Both diseases can cause serious morbidity and death."
How is echinococcosis transmitted?,"A number of herbivorous and omnivorous animals act as intermediate hosts of Echinococcus by ingesting parasite eggs in contaminated soil and developing parasitic larval stages in their viscera. Carnivores are definitive hosts of the parasite; they are infected through the consumption of viscera of intermediate hosts that harbour the parasite and also through scavenging infected carcases. Humans are accidental intermediate hosts and are unable to transmit the disease.
Transmission of cystic echinococcosis is principally maintained in a dog–sheep–dog cycle, although several other domestic animals may be involved including goats, swine, horses, cattle, camels and yaks. Transmission of alveolar echinococcosis usually occurs in a wildlife cycle among foxes, other carnivores and small mammals (mostly rodents). Domesticated dogs and cats can also be infected.
For both diseases, humans become infected through the ingestion of soil, water or food (e.g. green vegetables, berries) contaminated with the parasites’ eggs shed in the faeces of the carnivores, and also by hand-to-mouth transfer of eggs after contact with the contaminated fur of a carnivore, most commonly a dog."
What are the signs and symptoms?,"Cystic echinococcosis is characterized by an asymptomatic incubation period that can last many years until the parasite cysts evolve and trigger clinical signs, depending on the location and size of the cysts and the pressure exerted on the surrounding tissues. In cystic echinococcosis, the larval stages of the parasite develop as one or more cysts mainly in the liver and lungs, and less frequently in the bones, kidneys, spleen, muscles, central nervous system and eyes. Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting commonly occur when cysts invade the liver. If the lung is affected, clinical signs include chronic cough, chest pain and shortness of breath.
Alveolar echinococcosis is characterized by an asymptomatic incubation period of 5–15 years and the slow development of a primary tumour-like lesion which is usually located in the liver. Lesions may also involve other organs such as the spleen, lungs and brain following dissemination of the parasite via the blood and lymphatic system. Clinical signs include weight loss, abdominal pain, general malaise and signs of hepatic failure. If left untreated, alveolar echinococcosis is progressive and fatal."
How is echinococcosis diagnosed?,"Human cystic echinococcosis is diagnosed with imaging tools such as ultrasound or computed tomography, and its laboratory confirmation relies on serological tests.

Diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis is based on clinical findings and epidemiological data, imaging techniques, histopathology and/or nucleic acid detection, and serology."
How is echinococcosis treated?,"Both cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis can be expensive and complicated to treat, sometimes requiring extensive surgery and/or prolonged drug therapy.

Four options exist for the treatment of abdominal cystic echinococcosis: (i) percutaneous treatment of the hydatid cysts with the PAIR (Puncture, Aspiration, Injection, Re-aspiration) technique; (ii) surgery; (iii) anti-parasitic drug treatment; and (iv) expectant management (“watch and wait”). The choice must primarily be based on the ultrasound images of the cyst, following a stage-specific approach, and also on the medical infrastructure and human resources available to treat patients.

Early diagnosis and radical (tumour-like) surgery followed by anti-infective prophylaxis remain the key elements for alveolar echinococcosis. If the lesion is confined, radical surgery offers cure. Unfortunately, in many patients the disease is diagnosed at an advanced stage, and palliative surgery, if carried out without or with incomplete anti-parasitic treatment, frequently results in relapses."
Do all mosquitoes transmit malaria?,"Only certain species of mosquitoes of the Anopheles genus—and only females of those species—can transmit malaria.
		Malaria is caused by a one-celled parasite called a Plasmodium. Female Anopheles
 mosquitoes pick up the parasite from infected people when they bite to 
obtain blood needed to nurture their eggs. Inside the mosquito the 
parasites reproduce and develop. When the mosquito bites again, the 
parasites contained in the salivary gland are injected and pass into the
 blood of the person being bitten.Malaria parasites multiply rapidly in the liver and then in 
red blood cells of the infected person. One to two weeks after a person 
is infected the first symptoms of malaria appear: usually fever, 
headache, chills and vomiting. If not treated promptly with effective 
medicines, malaria can kill by infecting and destroying red blood cells 
and by clogging the capillaries that carry blood to the brain or other 
vital organs.There are four types of human malaria: Plasmodium vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. falciparum. P. vivax and P. falciparum
 are the most common forms. Falciparum malaria—the most deadly type—is 
most common in sub-Saharan Africa, where it causes more than 400 000  
deaths a year.In recent years, some human cases of malaria have also occurred with Plasmodium knowlesi – a species that causes malaria among monkeys and occurs in certain forested areas of South-East Asia."
What are the risks of diabetes in children?,"The frequency of diabetes is rising around the world, and studies are showing children are at increasing risk of developing the disease. Over time, diabetes can damage the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves, causing chronic problems and early death."
What is type 1 diabetes?,"Type 1 diabetes (sometimes called 
insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset diabetes) occurs when the
 pancreas does not produce enough insulin, a hormone that regulates 
blood sugar. The cause is not known, but it is thought to be the result 
of a combination of genetic and environmental factors.Many 
countries are documenting higher numbers of newly diagnosed cases of 
type 1 diabetes, particularly in younger children. Interestingly, some 
disease patterns among children resemble infectious disease epidemics. 
Currently, there is no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes."
What is type 2 diabetes?,"Type 2 diabetes (sometimes called non-insulin-dependent or adult-onset diabetes) happens when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Often preventable, it can result from excess body weight and physical inactivity, and sometimes, a genetic
    predisposition.Recently, type 2 diabetes has increasingly been reported in children and adolescents, so much so that in some parts of the world type 2 diabetes has become the main type of diabetes in children. The global rise of childhood obesity and physical inactivity
    is widely believed to play a crucial role. Healthy eating and lifestyle habits are a strong defence against the disease."
What are the determinants of health?,"The determinants of health include:the social and economic environment,the physical environment, andthe person’s individual characteristics and behaviours.The context of people’s lives determine their health, and so blaming individuals for having poor health or crediting them for good health is inappropriate. Individuals are unlikely to be able to directly control many of the determinants of health. These determinants—or things that make people healthy or not—include the above factors, and many others:Income and social status - higher income and social status are linked to better health. The greater the gap between the richest and poorest people, the greater the differences in health.Education – low education levels are linked with poor health, more stress and lower self-confidence.Physical environment – safe water and clean air, healthy workplaces, safe houses, communities and roads all contribute to good health. Employment and working conditions – people in employment are healthier, particularly those who have more control over their working conditionsSocial support networks – greater support from families, friends and communities is linked to better health. Culture - customs and traditions, and the beliefs of the family and community all affect health.Genetics - inheritance plays a part in determining lifespan, healthiness and the likelihood of developing certain illnesses. Personal behaviour and coping skills – balanced eating, keeping active, smoking, drinking, and how we deal with life’s stresses and challenges all affect health.Health services - access and use of services that prevent and treat disease influences healthGender - Men and women suffer from different types of diseases at different ages."
How does evidence-based approach work within health impact assessment?,"An evidence base about the impact that projects, programmes and policies have had on health is required to carry out health impact assessment (HIA). The best available evidence is used within the appraisal stage of HIA to determine what impacts may occur (both positive and negative), the size of the impact (if possible) and the distribution of that impact in different population groups. It is generally assumed that the evidence for health impacts exists, and that searching and collating will provide the necessary evidence. Unfortunately this is not often the case, and the evidence of health impacts is often not available. This is because of the long causal pathway between the implementation of a project/programme/policy and any potential impact on population health, and the many confounding factors that make the determination of a link difficult. Within the HIA it is important therefore to be explicit about sources of evidence and to identify missing or incomplete information.Providing a comprehensive review of the evidence base is not simple. It needs to draw on the best available evidence – that from reviews and research papers, and including qualitative and quantitative evidence. This information must be supplemented with local and expert knowledge, policy information, and proposal specific information.However, there are examples where the best available evidence has been documented, and in some cases summarised. These are presented below:TransportFood and AgricultureHousingWasteEnergyIndustryUrbanizationWaterRadiationNutrition and health"

What is the current status of dengue vaccine development?,"There is a growing public health need for effective preventive interventions against dengue, a disease caused by four viruses, termed serotypes 1-4. A safe, effective and affordable dengue vaccine against the four strains would represent a major advance for the control of the disease and could be an important tool for reaching the WHO goal of reducing dengue morbidity by at least 25% and mortality by at least 50% by 2020. One dengue vaccine has been licensed, Dengvaxia® (CYD-TDV), developed by Sanofi Pasteur. Approximately five additional dengue vaccine candidates are in clinical development, with two candidates (developed by NIH/Butantan and Takeda) now in Phase III trials."
What is Dengvaxia® (CYD-TDV)?,"CYD-TDV is the first dengue vaccine to be licensed. It was first licensed in Mexico in December 2015 for use in individuals 9-45 years of age living in endemic areas, and is now licensed in 20 countries. CYD-TDV is a live recombinant tetravalent dengue vaccine developed by Sanofi Pasteur (CYD-TDV), given as a 3-dose series on a 0/6/12 month schedule."
What are the results from the Phase 3 trials?,"CYD-TDV has been evaluated in two Phase 3 clinical trials (CYD14 in five countries in Asia and CYD15 in five countries in Latin America). Together, these trials included over 35,000 participants aged 2 to 16 years: ages at first vaccination were 2 to 14 years in CYD14, 9 to 16 years in CYD15. In each of these trials, participants were randomized to vaccine and placebo in a 2:1 ratio. The study protocols included an active phase of follow-up for one year after the last dose of vaccine in the series (25 months from dose 1) and include a hospital-based follow-up period of four additional years, which is ongoing.
Results have been published for each trial separately, as well as pooled. Trial results include children aged <9 years="""" old,="""" which="""" is="""" an="""" age="""" group="""" that="""" is="""" not="""" included="""" in="""" the="""" current="""" indication.="""" this="""" is="""" due="""" to="""" results="""" that="""" were="""" observed="""" during="""" the="""" phase="""" 3="""" trials="""" in="""" the="""" youngest="""" age="""" group="""" in="""" the="""" cyd14="""" phase="""" 3="""">
Vaccine efficacy against confirmed dengue pooled across both trials was 59.2% in the year following the primary series (per protocol analysis). During this initial time period, pooled vaccine efficacy against severe dengue was 79.1%. Efficacy varied by serotype: vaccine efficacy was higher against serotypes 3 and 4 (71.6% and 76.9%, respectively) than for serotypes 1 and 2 (54.7% and 43.0%). Vaccine efficacy also varied by age at vaccination and serostatus at baseline (i.e., previous exposure to dengue prior to vaccination).
When limited to older age groups (ages included in the current licensure), pooled vaccine efficacy amongst all participants aged 9 years or over was 65.6%, and in participants aged <9 years="""" it="""" was="""">
Within the randomized subset of participants for whom pre-vaccination blood samples were collected, pooled vaccine efficacy against VCD in those seropositive for a prior exposure to dengue virus was 78.2%, while in those seronegative at baseline it was 38.1% (not statistically significant). In a post-hoc analysis in those ≥9 years of age, vaccine efficacy in those seronegative at baseline was 52.5% (95% CI 5.9%, 76.1%).
While efficacy was reported against hospitalized and severe dengue in Years 1 and 2 post-dose 1, an excess of cases of hospitalized and severe dengue cases in those receiving CYD-TDV was seen in Year 3 in some subgroups, although it is based on relatively small numbers of cases. The excess was mostly observed in those vaccinated aged 2-5 years in CYD14 in Asia, for which the relative risk of hospitalized dengue in vaccinees was 7.45 (95% CI 1.15, 313.80) in Year 3, based on 15 cases in the CYD-TDV group and 1 case in the control group. This younger age group has not been included in the age indication of the vaccine. No safety signals were reported in the older age groups at the time of the April 2016 SAGE recommendations. SAGE noted that the evidence of the absence of a safety issue in seronegative individuals aged 9 and above was based on the limited data set of 10%-20% of the trial population, and highlighted the urgent need to better describe the long-term benefit-risk ratio of CYD-TDV in seronegative individuals.
On 29 November 2017, Sanofi Pasteur announced the results of additional studies to better describe the benefit-risk in seronegative individuals. This was made possible through the use of a newly developed NS1-based antibody assay applied to blood samples taken 13 months after vaccination to retrospectively infer dengue serostatus at time of first vaccination."
What are the findings from the additional analyses on long-term safety follow up stratified by serostatus at time of first vaccination?,"The new analyses from the long-term safety follow-up indicated that:

Overall population level benefit of vaccination remains favorable, but the vaccine performs differently in seropositive versus seronegative individuals.
Vaccine efficacy (VE) against virologically confirmed symptomatic dengue was high among inferred baseline seropositive participants ≥9 years of age: 76% (95%CI: 63.9, to 84.0), but much lower among baseline seronegative participants: 38.8% (95%CI: –0.9 to 62.9%) in the first 25 months after the first dose of vaccine.
There is an increased risk of hospitalized and severe dengue in seronegative individuals starting about 30 months after the first dose.
In areas of 70% dengue seroprevalence, over a 5-year follow-up, for every 4 severe cases prevented in seropositive, there would be one excess severe case in seronegative per 1,000 vaccinees; for every 13 hospitalizations prevented in seropositive vaccinees, there would be 1 excess hospitalization in seronegative vaccinees per 1,000 vaccinees."
What are WHO’s recommendations related to CYD-TDV?,"Following the release of the long-term safety data stratified by serostatus on 29 November 2017, a SAGE working group on dengue vaccines was reconvened and a thorough review of the new data with the guidance of external experts such ethicists and modellers was conducted.
In light of the new evidence on the long-term safety issue in seronegative individuals, balanced against the documented efficacy and safety in seropositive individuals, SAGE carefully considered two strategies: population seroprevalence criteria versus pre-vaccination screening. SAGE weighed up the feasibility of population seroprevalence studies and individual pre-vaccination screening, heterogeneity of seroprevalence between and within countries, potential vaccine coverage rates, public confidence in national vaccination programmes, perceptions of ethical considerations with regard to population level benefit versus individual level risk, and communication issues.
SAGE concluded that for countries considering vaccination as part of their dengue control program, a “pre-vaccination screening strategy” would be the preferred option, in which only dengue-seropositive persons are vaccinated.
Serological testing for past dengue infection (e.g. dengue IgG ELISA) could be used to identify persons who have had previous dengue infections. Currently available rapid diagnostic tests, despite their lower sensitivity and specificity to detect past dengue infection compared with conventional dengue IgG ELISA, could be considered in high transmission settings until better tests are available. In settings with high seroprevalence, a test with lower specificity might be acceptable. In settings with low to moderate seroprevalence, a test with high specificity is needed.
Given that no test will be 100% specific, some truly seronegative individuals may be vaccinated due to a false positive test result. Furthermore, although the efficacy against dengue infections in seropositive individuals is high, it is still not complete. Hence, the limitations of CYD-TDV will need to be clearly communicated to those offered vaccination.
Decisions about implementing a pre-vaccination screening strategy will require careful assessment at the country level, including sensitivity and specificity of a screening, dengue hospitalization rates, and affordability of both CYD-TDV and tests. Vaccination should be considered as part of an integrated dengue prevention and control strategy together with well-executed and sustained vector control and the best evidence-based clinical care.
The vaccine should be used within the indicated age range, typically 9 to 45 years of age. The optimal age group to be targeted is the age at which the incidence of severe dengue is highest, and this can be ascertained from national and subnational routine hospital data.
In the absence of data on vaccine efficacy and safety with fewer than three doses, CYD-TDV is recommended as a three-dose series given 6 months apart.
SAGE highlighted that important research and implementation questions remain for CYD-TDV, in particular the development of a highly sensitive and specific rapid diagnostic test to determine serostatus, simplified immunization schedules, and assessment of the need for boosters.
WHO will publish a revised position paper in September 2018 based on the SAGE recommendations from 18 April 2018."
Has the vaccine been prequalified by WHO?,"CYD-TDV is currently not prequalified. Prequalification requires an NRA of record, which is typically the NRA in the manufacturing country (in this case, EMA). WHO is awaiting a submission of an application from the manufacturer for prequalification of this vaccine."
What other interventions exist for dengue control?,"Vector control has been the key strategy to control or prevent the transmission of dengue virus. Strategies include:

preventing mosquitoes from accessing egg-laying habitats by environmental management and modification;
disposing of solid waste properly and removing artificial man-made habitats;
covering, emptying and cleaning of domestic water storage containers on a weekly basis;
applying appropriate insecticides to water storage outdoor containers;
using of personal household protection such as window screens, long-sleeved clothes, insecticide treated materials, coils and vaporizers;
improving community participation and mobilization for sustained vector control;
applying insecticides as space spraying during outbreaks as one of the emergency vector-control measures
active monitoring and surveillance of vectors should be carried out to determine effectiveness of control interventions."
What is dengue fever and severe dengue?,"Dengue is a vector-borne disease transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. There are 4 serotypes of the virus that causes dengue. These are known as DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, DEN-4.
Severe dengue is a potentially lethal complication which can develop from dengue infections.
It is estimated that there are over 50-100 million cases of dengue worldwide each year and 3 billion people living in dengue endemic countries."
Where does the disease occur?,"Dengue is mainly transmitted by a mosquito (Aedes aegypti) and is distributed across all tropical countries (map available). Ae. aegypti and other species such as Ae. albopictus are highly adaptive and their combined distribution can spread dengue higher up north across Europe or North America during summer. (Note: Travellers already infected with the virus also spread the disease when they get bitten by the local Aedes mosquito population).
Dengue outbreaks can occur anytime, as long as the mosquitoes are still active. However, in general, high humidity and temperature are conditions that favour mosquito survival, increasing the likelihood of transmission."
What are the symptoms of dengue fever and severe dengue?,"Dengue fever
Dengue causes flu-like symptoms and lasts for 2-7 days. Dengue fever usually occurs after an incubation period of 4-10 days after the bite of the infected mosquito.
High Fever (40°C/ 104°F) is usually accompanied by at least two of the following symptoms:

Headaches
Pain behind eyes
Nausea, vomiting
Swollen glands
Joint, bone or muscle pains
Rash

Severe dengue
When developing into severe dengue, the critical phase takes place around 3-7 days after the first sign of illness. Temperature will decrease; this does NOT mean the person is necessarily recovering. On the other hand, special attention needs to be given to these warning signs as it could lead to severe dengue:

Severe abdominal pain
Persistent vomiting
Bleeding gums
Vomiting blood
Rapid breathing
Fatigue/ restlessness

When severe dengue is suspected, the person should be rushed to the emergency room or to the closest health care provider as it causes:

Plasma leaking that may lead to shock and/or fluid accumulation with/without respiratory distress;
Severe bleeding;
Severe organ impairment."
What is the treatment for dengue?,"There is no vaccine or specific medication for dengue fever.
Patients should seek medical advice, rest and drink plenty of fluids. Paracetamol can be taken to bring down fever and reduce joint pains. However, aspirin or ibuprofen should not be taken since they can increase the risk of bleeding.
Patients who are already infected with the dengue virus can transmit the infection via Aedes mosquitoes after the first symptoms appear (during 4-5 days; maximum 12). As a precautionary approach, patients can adopt measures to reduce transmission by sleeping under a treated net especially during the period of illness with fever.
Infection with one strain will provide life-time protection only against that particular strain. However, it is still possible to become infected by other strains and develop into severe dengue.
When warning signs of severe dengue are present (listed above), it is imperative to consult a doctor and seek hospitalization to manage the disease.
With proper medical care and early recognition, case-fatality rates are below 1%. However, the overall experience remains very discomforting and unpleasant."
What should I do if I suspect I have dengue?,"If you suspect you have dengue you need to see a doctor immediately. To diagnose dengue fever, your doctor will:

Evaluate your signs and symptoms;
Test your blood for evidence of a dengue virus;
Review your medical and travel history.

Persons who had travelled to dengue endemic countries during the past two weeks should inform the doctor about it."
Who spreads dengue and severe dengue?,"Dengue is spread through the bite of the female mosquito (Aedes aegypti). The mosquito becomes infected when it takes the blood of a person infected with the virus. After about one week, the mosquito can then transmit the virus while biting a healthy person. The mosquito can fly up to 400 meters looking for water-filled containers to lay their eggs but usually remains close to the human habitation.
Aedes aegypti is a daytime feeder: The peak biting periods are early in the morning and in the evening before dusk.
Dengue cannot be spread directly from person to person. However, a person infected and suffering from dengue fever can infect other mosquitoes. Humans are known to carry the infection from one country to another or from one area to another during the stage when the virus circulates and reproduces in the blood system.
Aedes aegypti has evolved into an intermittent biter and prefers to bite more than one person during the feeding period. This mechanism has made Aedes aegypti a very highly efficient epidemic vector mosquito."
Where do the mosquitoes breed?,"The mosquitoes thrive in areas close to human population (urban areas).
The dengue mosquito lays its eggs in water-filled containers inside the house and surrounding areas of dwellings (this includes non-used bottles, containers, discarded waste, tyres etc… which hold water).
The eggs hatch when in contact with water. Eggs can withstand very dry conditions and survive for months. Female mosquitoes lay dozens of eggs up to 5 times during their lifetime.
Adult mosquitoes “usually” rest indoors in dark areas (closets, under beds, behind curtains). Here it is protected from wind, rain and most predators, which increases its life expectancy and the probability that it will live long enough to pick up a virus from one person and pass it on to the next."
What can be done to reduce the risk of acquiring dengue?,"The best preventive measure for areas infested with Aedes mosquito is to eliminate the mosquitoes’ egg laying sites – called source reduction. Lowering the number of eggs, larvae and pupae will reduce the number of emerging adult mosquitoes and the transmission of the disease. Examples of the following habitats are listed:

Indoor
    
Ant traps
Flower vases and saucers
Water storage tank (domestic drinking water, bathroom, etc…)
Plastic containers
Bottles


Outdoor
    
Discarded bottles and tins
Discarded tyres
Artificial containers
Tree holes, potholes, construction sites
Drums for collecting rainwater
Shells, husks, pods from trees
Leaf axils of various plants
Boats, equipment



Items that collect rainwater or are used to store water should be covered or properly discarded. The remaining essential containers should be emptied and cleaned and scrubbed (to remove eggs) at least once a week. This will avoid the adult mosquitoes to emerge from the egg/ larva/ pupa stage.
In fact, the community participation is the key to dengue prevention. As every household aims to reduce vector density, the transmission rate will decrease or maybe even stop."
Personal and household protection,"Protecting yourself from mosquito bites is most effective by reducing exposed skin to mosquitoes to bite on. Long-sleeved clothing and mosquito repellents (containing DEET, IR3535 or Icaridin) are the most viable options.
Window and door screens, air conditioning reduces the risk of mosquitoes coming into contact with the household members. Mosquito nets (and/or insecticide-treated nets) will also provide additional protection to people sleeping during the day, or protect against other mosquitoes which can bite at night (such as malaria). Household insecticides aerosols, mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers maybe also reduce biting activity."
How do I reach out to others for help when caring for someone with dementia?,"Caring for someone with dementia can be overwhelming and does not need to be a lonely experience. Remember that you are not alone – ask for help. Describe your problem and what kind of help you need. It might be help with cleaning or preparing meals, support for activities with the person with dementia, or emotional support or information. Be flexible - you may not get exactly what you asked for, but it is a start and will be helpful.  Organizations that provide these types of support may be available in your local community, or online. Your local Alzheimer’s association or your local doctor can be a good place to start.  For more information see iSupport Module 2 Being a caregiver, Lesson 3 Involving others."
How can I care for myself?,"Social support is important – stay connected as much as possible. Talk regularly to someone you trust and who understands your situation and feelings. This might be family, friends, a community, religious or spiritual leader, a neighbour, or a volunteer. Focus on relaxation – it can make you feel less tense. It can also help you be more effective in getting tasks done and free up more of your time for doing things you enjoy. Relaxation is different for everyone. Some people find meditating or doing a breathing exercise relaxing. Others enjoy stretching, reading a book, listening to music, or doing activities with the person they care for. Find what works best for you and try to do something relaxing every day. You may think that events make you feel angry, sad or guilty. However, it is how you think about them that makes you feel that way. It can be helpful to identify the specific situations that make you feel bad and what your thoughts are in that situation. You might also want to identify what would be a more helpful way of thinking and how more helpful thoughts can make you feel better.For more information see iSupport Module 2 Being a caregiver, Lesson 4 Involving othersModule 3 Caring for me, Lessons 1 Reducing stress in everyday life, 2 Making time for pleasant activities, and 3 Thinking differently."
How do I ensure that the person with dementia continues to receive care if I am no longer able to provide it?,"Plan in advance – ask the person with dementia about their care preferences, including by whom and where they would like care to be provided. Identify people who would be willing to provide support if you can no longer provide care. Plan for costs of future care and discuss preferences in case of more advanced care needs and end-of-life decisions. Gather information to make informed choices. Make decisions together and talk with your family, friends, doctor, any others close to you and the person with dementia. Prepare instructions that reflect the wishes of the person with dementia in accordance with the legal framework in your country.  For more information see iSupportModule 2 Being a caregiver, Lessons 1 The journey together and 3 Supported decision-making. Consult the website of Alzheimer Disease International  for information related to caring for someone with dementia."
How can I respond to changes in the person with dementia?,"As dementia progresses, the person with dementia may change. Changes may include agitation, depression, anxiety or apathy, becoming withdrawn or overly suspicious, having difficulty sleeping or changes in judgement. The person may also show signs of confusion, deterioration of existing cognitive problems (e.g. memory), delusions and hallucinations, and repetitive behaviours or wandering. Identify the changes and what appears to be triggering them. Think about the best ways to respond that will be the least distressing to you and the person with dementia. Try different responses and approaches – your first response may not always work.If the person has serious and constant mood changes or if you think that they are in danger of harming themselves, seek immediate medical advice.For more information see iSupportModule 5 Dealing with behavior changes, Lesson 1 Introduction to behavior changes and Lesson 4 Depression, anxiety and apathy. Lessons 2 through 9 provide additional information about other behavior changes. Consult Alzheimer’s Disease International’s webpage for information related to caring for someone with dementia."
How can I provide everyday care to the person with dementia?,"As dementia progresses, you may need to provide more care that you are currently doing. Make sure that the person is eating and drinking. You may need to regularly remind them to do so. Adjust their diet according to their preferences and health. Remember to keep inedible items, sharp objects, household chemicals and flammable materials in a safe place. Modifying the environment can help reduce incontinence accidents. For example, put a picture of a toilet on the bathroom door. Remind the person to go to the bathroom regularly. Consider using incontinence aids and equipment if necessary. Do not blame the person for accidents. Engage the person in personal care by helping them do as much as they can themselves. Try modifying the environment, for example by switching from a shower to a sponge bath, and provide guidance. Be mindful of falls – use a non-slip shower or bath mat. The person with dementia may resist when you try to assist with personal care. Be compassionate and try to understand why.It is important to maintain routines similar to the ones that the person had before developing dementia. Be prepared to adapt routines as necessary as the abilities of the person change over time.For more information see iSupportModule 4 Providing everyday care, Lessons 1 Eating and drinking – more pleasant mealtimes, 2 Eating, drinking and preventing health problems, 3 Toileting and continence care, and 4 Personal care. Consult Alzheimer’s Disease International’s webpage for information related to caring for someone with dementia."
How can I communicate effectively with the person with dementia?,"Dementia can often make communication difficult. This can have an impact on your relationship with the person you care for and can be frustrating, upsetting or irritating for both of you. Get attention in a respectful way. Speak clearly, slowly and at a volume that is comfortable for them. Speak face-to-face and at eye level. You might also try lightly tapping a hand, arm or front of the shoulder, or calling the person by their name or a nickname that they recognize.Ask or tell the person with dementia one thing at a time. Use short sentences and simple words that the person with dementia can understand. Repeat information calmly, as often as necessary. When needed, change from open-ended to close-ended questions that can be answered by yes or no. Make sure that there are no distracting background noises such as a television or radio.Try to stay in control of your feelings. Sometimes, you might not understand what the person you care for is trying to say. It is important that you take the person seriously – they are trying to tell you something. Be patient and give the person time to find their words. Pay attention to their reactions, including facial expressions and body language. Show compassion about the feelings that the person expresses. Remember that saying something positive or complimenting the person can make them feel good.For more information see iSupportModule 2 Being a caregiver, Lessons 1 The journey together and 2 Improving communication. Consult Alzheimer’s Disease International’s webpage for information related to caring for someone with dementia."
What chemicals can be used as chemical weapons?,"In principle, any toxic chemical in combination with a suitable delivery method can be used to inflict harm. During the 20th century, a number of groups of chemicals were developed on a large-scale as weapons. This category of weapon employs the toxicity of their active components to cause temporary incapacitation, permanent harm or death. Chemical weapons can be irritants, choking agents, disabling chemicals, blistering agents, nerve agents, or asphyxiants. Depending on the agent involved, and on the means for dispersal, chemical weapons can be in liquid, solid or gaseous forms. The development, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons are banned under the prohibitions of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which came into force in April 1997."
What treatment exists?,"In most cases treatment involves removal from exposure, decontamination and symptomatic and supportive care, but the type of treatment required will differ depending on the chemicals involved. Antidotes are available for a small number of chemicals, for example for some nerve agents. These antidotes should be administered under medical supervision as soon as possible after exposure."
How would I know if a chemical had been released?,"There are a number of features that suggest a toxic chemical has been released: the more features noted, the stronger the likelihood. These include the following: an unexplained smell, such as a smell of garlic, horseradish, onions, bleach or a fruity smell; a visible mist or cloud not consistent with the weather; the presence of droplets or an oily film on surfaces; the presence of a suspicious device, such as an exploded shell or an abandoned tanker (especially in close proximity to the smell or mist); multiple sick or dead animals, and multiple sick or dead people. Some typical symptoms include: eye irritation, itchy nose, sneezing, coughing, difficulty in breathing, runny eyes and nose, drooling, itchy or stinging skin, a sudden urge to urinate, defecate or vomit, blurred vision, muscle twitching, dizziness, disorientation, feeling faint."
What can I do to protect myself if I think that a chemical has been released?,"You should try to move away from the source as quickly as possible, staying upwind if you can (i.e. so that any wind is blowing the chemical away from you) or moving crosswind. Many chemical weapons are heavier than air so it is usually a good idea to move to higher ground. If the release was outdoors, then moving into a building onto an upper floor and closing windows, doors, vents and switching off any equipment that draws air in from outside (e.g. air-conditioners) will provide some protection."
What should I do if I think that I have been exposed to a chemical weapon?,"Most chemical weapons are harmful by inhalation and some are also harmful by skin contact and absorption. Some chemicals have a rapid effect, such as most nerve agents, while others may not cause effects for a number of hours, such as mustard agents. It is important to remove chemicals from your skin as quickly as possible to prevent them from being absorbed and from injuring your skin. Clothing provides some limited and temporary protection from skin exposure and taking off your clothes will often remove a large proportion of the chemical. Since contaminated clothing will provide a source of exposure to others e.g. anyone coming to your assistance, removing your clothes and placing them in a closable container (e.g. a strong plastic bag) will also protect other people. You should also try to wash yourself with soap and water, or with water alone, not forgetting your hair and ears. If your eyes are irritated then rinse them with clean, cool water for several minutes. You should then seek medical help. For more information on decontamination see below."
How can I decontaminate myself?,"Once you have moved away from the source and found a safe place, you should remove your clothes as quickly as possible (see below), then wash your entire body and hair with soap and water (ideally), or with water alone. Do not scrub as this may damage the skin and increase absorption of the chemical. If your eyes are irritated then rinse them with clean, cool water for several minutes.When removing your clothes you should try to avoid spreading chemicals from the clothes onto your skin, for example do not pull clothes over your head if possible – it is better to cut them off. Try not to touch any wet or powdery areas. Put the clothes into a container that you can close e.g. a strong plastic bag. Try to avoid touching contaminated clothes with your bare hands – use an implement or wear thick rubber gloves. Put any contaminated personal effects or other objects into the same bag. Close the bag securely and, if possible, put this bag into another bag and close that tightly. Remember that the contents are contaminated so put a warning on the bag and put the bag in a secure place outside until it can be disposed of.If possible, decontaminate yourself before going to get medical attention. Firstly this will reduce your own exposure to the chemical. Secondly, it will prevent you from contaminating other people, including health care workers, and also the treatment centre. Do not be surprised if you are put through another decontamination process before being allowed into a treatment facility."
How should I help someone who has been exposed to a chemical weapon?,"You should take care not to become contaminated yourself. You should not enter a chemically-contaminated area unless you have been trained to work in such an area and are wearing a full chemical protection suit with self-contained breathing apparatus (sometimes called Level A protection). If you are assisting a victim who has left the contaminated area you should still wear specialised personal protective equipment, including chemically-resistant suit and gloves, eye protection and respirator with an air purifying filter. If this equipment is not available and the victim is conscious and able to move then encourage the victim undress and wash him or herself. Find medical help for the victim as quickly as possible. Note that you should not take chemically-contaminated victims into a health care facility otherwise you will risk contaminating the facility and poisoning staff and other patients. Victims should be decontaminated before entering a health care facility."
What are the effects of exposure to nerve agents?,"Nerve agents include substances such as sarin, tabun and VX. Some pesticides show a similar mode of action but are less toxic than nerve agents. These chemicals are absorbed by inhalation, and through the skin and mucous membranes. They are also toxic if swallowed, for example by ingesting contaminated food or water. Once absorbed they affect the nervous system and cause, amongst other things, runny nose, watery eyes, drooling, sweating, vomiting and diarrhoea, incontinence, tightness of the chest and difficulty breathing, coughing, confusion, muscle twitching, collapse and convulsions."
What should I do if I think I have been exposed to nerve agent?,"You should try to move away from the source as quickly as possible, staying upwind if you can (i.e. so that any wind is blowing the chemical away from you) or moving crosswind. Nerve agents are heavier than air and will tend to sink to low-lying areas, therefore move to higher ground if you can.Once you have reached a safe area, you should remove your clothing as quickly as possible (see below), and wash your entire body, including your hair, with soap and water (ideally), or water alone. Do not scrub as this may damage the skin and increase absorption of the chemical. If your eyes are irritated then rinse them with clean, cool water for several minutes. You should then seek medical help.When removing your clothes you should try to avoid spreading chemicals from the clothes onto your skin, for example do not pull clothes over your head if possible – it is better to cut them off. Try not to touch any wet or powdery areas. Put the clothes into a container that you can close e.g. a strong plastic bag. Try to avoid touching contaminated clothes with your bare hands – use an implement or wear thick rubber gloves. Put any contaminated personal effects or other objects into the same bag. Close the bag securely and, if possible, put this bag into another bag and close that tightly. Remember that the contents are contaminated so put a warning on the bag and put the bag in a secure place outside until it can be disposed of."
What are the effects of exposure to chlorine?,"Chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas with a distinctive bleach-like smell. It is intensely irritant and exposure will immediately result in stinging and watering of the eyes, you may start coughing, have a feeling of tightness of the chest, difficulty in breathing, headache and nausea and vomiting. After severe exposure, pulmonary oedema may develop after 12-36 hours. Chlorine may also cause skin irritation, and exposure to compressed gas as it is released from pressure can cause frostbite."
What should I do if I think I have been exposed to chlorine?,"You should try to move away from the source as quickly as possible, staying upwind if you can (i.e. so that any wind is blowing the chemical away from you) or moving crosswind. Since chlorine is heavier than air you should avoid low-lying areas and move to higher ground.Once you have reached a safe area, you should remove your clothing as quickly as possible (see below) and wash your entire body with soap and water (ideally), or water alone. If your eyes are irritated then rinse them with clean, cool water for several minutes. You should then seek medical help.If you think you have been exposed to liquid chlorine (for example if you were close to a discharging cylinder of chlorine) then you should take care when removing your clothes to try to avoid spreading chemicals from the clothes onto your skin, for example do not pull clothes over your head if possible – it is better to cut them off. Try not to touch any wet areas. If clothing is stuck to your skin do not pull it off – soak the area in tepid water and try to ease the clothing off. Put the clothes into a container that you can close e.g. a strong plastic bag. Try to avoid touching contaminated clothes with your bare hands – use an implement or wear thick rubber gloves. Put any contaminated personal effects or other objects into the same bag. Close the bag securely and, if possible, put this bag into another bag and close that tightly. Remember that the contents are contaminated so put a warning on the bag and put the bag in a secure place outside until it can be disposed of."
What are the effects of exposure to mustard gas?,"There are a number of different types of mustard agent e.g. sulphur mustard and nitrogen mustard but they are all blistering agents. You can be exposed by skin or eye contact and by inhaling the vapour. These agents are also toxic if swallowed, for example by ingesting contaminated food or water. Mustard agents can linger in the environment for several days.Mustard agents are irritant chemicals that can cause blistering and damage to the skin, eyes and lungs. Exposure may relatively quickly result in eye irritation, coughing, hoarseness and mild irritation to the skin, but often the severe effects of exposure, including characteristic blistering, are delayed for several hours. Effects can include painful eyes and difficulty in seeing, retching and vomiting, itching and reddening of the skin and the formation of blisters, coughing, sneezing, difficulty breathing and chest infection. Exposure to mustard agents does not usually result in death."
What should I do if I think I have been exposed to mustard gas?,"You should try to move away from the source as quickly as possible, staying upwind if you can (i.e. so that any wind is blowing the chemical away from you) or moving crosswind. Avoid touching contaminated surfaces and any pools of liquid or water that may be contaminated.

Has WHO published any guidance on the management of exposure to chemical weapons?,"WHO has published guidance on the public health response to biological and chemical weapons. It is available on the WHO website:Public health response to biological and chemical weaponsA range of information sheets on exposure to chemicals can be found in English and Arabic on the following webpages:Deliberate eventsRegional Centre for Environmental Health ActionIn addition, information on a wide range of chemicals is available on the International Programme on Chemical Safety INCHEM websiteProgramme on chemical safety INCHEMConcise information on chemicals, in the form of International Chemical Safety Cards, which are developed by WHO and the International Labour Organization (ILO), can be viewed on the ILO website.International chemical safety cards"
Is there any guidance on the impact on the mental health of populations of exposure to chemical weapons?,WHO has published guidance on this subject in Mental Health of Populations Exposed to Biological and Chemical Weapons.Mental health of populations exposed to biological and chemical weapons
Can chemical weapons pose a threat to the food chain?,"Following the release of a chemical weapon, food and/or water may become contaminated. In addition, chemicals may deliberately be introduced into the food chain or water supply. The nerve agents sarin and tabun mix easily with water and, depending on their concentration in the water, they could cause poisoning if the water was consumed or was used on the skin. These chemicals are not persistent in water, however, and usually degrade over 1-2 days. The nerve agent VX is less soluble but more persistent, breaking down into a chemical that is toxic by ingestion. In water, mustard agents may form globules surrounded by a protective outer layer. These globules may settle out and may persist for several years, continuing to pose a hazard by contact and by ingestion. You should avoid contact with, and consumption of, food or water that you think might be contaminated.WHO has published guidance on protecting the food and water supply systems from deliberate chemical contamination, as follows:Precautions against the sabotage of drinking-water, food, and other productsTerrorists threats to food"
How can chemical weapons be detected?,"Detection and monitoring for the presence of chemical weapons is the task of specialized units in most countries. There are commercially available detection kits for the commonly known chemical weapons, and civil authorities, such as fire brigades, police, emergency medical personnel and the military can use these. The effects of chemical weapons will usually be rapidly apparent."
How can chemical weapons be disposed of or destroyed?,"The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has the responsibility for overseeing and verifying the safe and secure destruction of these weapons in countries that are Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention. A number of techniques, including incineration, exist for destroying chemical weapons but older methods such as dumping, burial, or open-pit burning are prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention."
What is WHO’s role if chemical weapons are used?,"In accordance with World Health Assembly resolution WHA55.16 adopted in May 2002, technical support is available to Member States from WHO in developing or strengthening preparedness for, and response to, the deliberate use of biological and chemical agents to cause harm.Under the International Health Regulations, WHO provides assistance to Member States in dealing with the public health consequences of chemical and other emergencies and will therefore respond if assistance is requested.If requested, WHO will also provide technical support for the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism to investigate the alleged use of chemical and biological weapons, but WHO has no formal role in investigating the use of chemical weapons.The statement by the World Health Assembly in resolution WHA20.54 of 25 May 1967 that “scientific achievements, and particularly in the field of biology and medicine – that most humane science – should be used only for mankind’s benefit, but never to do it any harm” remains as valid today as it was then."
What other organizations could assist in responding to deliberate chemical release?,"The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which is the implementing organization for the Chemical Weapons Convention, can provide assistance if chemical weapons are used or threatened.Member States of the OPCW can request international assistanceOPCW has published a “Practical Guide for Medical Management of Chemical Warfare Casualties”"
What is safe listening?,"The term safe listening simply refers to a specific listening behaviour that does not put your hearing at risk. Your risk of losing your hearing depends on how loud, for how long and how often you are exposed to loud sounds. These may be through personal audio devices or in entertainment venues as well as in the environment around you such as in traffic, in the workplace or at home.
Sensory cells can tolerate only a certain amount of daily noise before being damaged: this amount is called the daily sound allowance. If your cells are exposed to too much sound, you exceed your daily sound allowance which harms your ears and hearing. Over time this results in hearing loss.
Your daily sound allowance works like a monetary allowance or pocket money: you have a limited amount to spend each day. For example, the louder or longer you are exposed to high levels of sound, the more you “spend”, the faster you run out of your allowance.
To practice safe listening, you must stay within the limits of your allowance. On your personal audio device this can be easily done with the help of software that monitors your daily sound allowance. It is more difficult to monitor exposure to loud sounds in entertainment venues or the environment generally.
Hence, to practice safe listening, you should:

Always stay within your permissible daily sound allowance.
On some days you may visit noisy places such as a arenas hosting sporting events or concerts, discotheques, bars or even a fitness class with loud music. The high level of sound in these places also affects your daily sound allowance. For this reason, you should avoid the additional use of your ear/headphones on these days. If you choose to listen, you should reduce your listening volume and your listening time to make sure you do not exceed your daily sound allowance. Listening at a level of 80 dB for 40 hours per week can help you to listen safely.
If you are exposed to sound in your workplace, you must take extra care and ensure that you stay well within your recommended sound allowance.


Check out this video to learn more about safe listening levels and times:"
How is loudness measured? What is dB?,"The unit of measurement used to express the intensity of a sound is the decibel (dB). A whisper is around 30 dB and normal conversation approximately 60 dB. Some common sounds and their intensities (dB) are indicated below.Device/situationdB (approximate)Ticking watch20Soft whisper30Normal conversation60Vacuum cleaner75Heavy city traffic (inside the car)85Motorcycle95Hairdryer, subway train, car horn at 5 m100MP3 player at maximum volume, chainsaw105Shouting into the ear110Discotheques, bars and club112Loud rock concerts115Spectator trumpet (vuvuzela) 1 m from trumpet opening, sirens120Jackhammer, jet plane 30 m away130Firecrackers, firearms150      The intensity of sound and the duration of exposure contribute to the overall sound energy level to which the individual is exposed; in other words, your risk of losing your hearing depends on how loud, for how long and how often you are exposed to loud
    sounds"
What is the Make Listening Safe initiative?,"WHO estimates that 1.1 billion young people worldwide are at risk of hearing loss due to unsafe listening practices. This includes exposure to loud sounds on personal audio devices and in noisy entertainment venues. In order to address this concern, WHO has launched the Make Listening Safe initiative. This initiative aims to reduce hearing loss caused by listening to loud sounds by promoting safe listening."
How do loud sounds affect my ears?,"Ears are the organs that process sounds, enabling the brain to interpret what you are hearing. Sensory cells within your ears help you listen. Listening to loud sounds over long periods of time can cause damage which can result in temporary or permanent hearing loss or a ringing sensation in the ear (tinnitus).
The hearing loss may not be noticeable initially. You may only have trouble hearing some high-pitched sounds like bells. Continued listening at unsafe levels leads to irreversible hearing loss. This can make it difficult to communicate with others, especially in noisy places like restaurants and markets."
How can I tell if my hearing has been affected?,"Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent. For example, a person who attends a loud concert may come out feeling slightly deaf or experiencing tinnitus. This is a temporary hearing loss and hearing in this case usually recovers within a few hours or a day. Regular or prolonged noise exposure can cause gradual, irreversible damage to the sensory cells, leading to permanent hearing loss. While temporary hearing loss gives no indication of the degree of permanent hearing loss that might eventually be experienced, it is a good predictor of the early development of permanent hearing loss.
Therefore, it is important to be alert to early warning signs of hearing loss:

ringing in the ears (tinnitus);
difficulty in hearing high-pitched sounds (birds singing, doorbells, telephones, alarm clocks);
difficulty understanding speech, especially over the telephone;
difficulty following conversations in noisy environments, such as in restaurants, markets or at social gatherings.

If you think that you have any of these problems, you should get your hearing checked. WHO has developed the hearWHO app so you can check your hearing anytime you want."
Once I have lost my hearing can I get it back?,"Lengthy exposure to noise in discotheques, bars, arenas hosting sporting events or concerts has been known to result in a sensation of sound in the ears known as tinnitus. Normally tinnitus recovers within a short time. If the exposure of loud sounds continues for a long time, this can lead to permanent hearing loss which involves the damage of sensory cells. Once damaged, sensory cells which are responsible for hearing, cannot regenerate. There is no medical or surgical cure for noise-induced hearing loss.
However, hearing loss is usually slow in onset, but progresses for as long as the exposure continues. The progression of hearing loss can be prevented by avoiding loud sounds and practicing safe listening (see Question 2)."
Is there a way to monitor my listening levels on the mobile phone?,"Smartphone apps are available that allow you to track your in-ear sound exposure while listening to music. Normally, if you increase the volume above a certain threshold, apps prompt a message to help you adhere to safe listening levels. These apps can be downloaded on your phone and used every time you listen to music with your headphones."
What is WHO doing to promote safe listening through personal audio devices?,"In 2015 WHO launched the Make Listening Safe initiative with the overall vision to ensure that people of all ages can enjoy listening with the full protection of their hearing. The objective of the initiative is to reduce the risk of hearing loss posed by exposure to unsafe levels of sound in entertainment venues and to ensure that listeners of all ages can listen to music safely on their personal audio devices. As part of this initiative WHO, in collaboration with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), has developed the global standard for safe listening personal audio devices. Once adopted by governments and manufacturers, this standard will ensure that personal audio devices on the market facilitate users’ safe listening behaviours.
When choosing your personal audio devices, you will then be able to ask for devices that comply with this global standard."
What can I do to make my listening safe?,"Keep the volume down, by staying within the 80 dB limit as far as possible for no longer than 40 hours per week.
Wear earplugs when visiting discotheques, bars, arenas hosting sporting events and concerts other noisy places.
Use noise-cancelling earphones/headphones, as these can reduce the need to raise the volume when you are in a noisy environment, such as when travelling on a train or bus.
Monitor and respect safe listening levels, and stay within your daily sound allowance.
Limit the daily use of your personal audio devices.
Limit time spent engaged in activities in noisy places:
    
take short listening breaks (go to a quiet place or corner and allow your ears to rest)
move away from loud sounds by keeping a distance between yourself and the sound source such as speakers
reduce your frequency of visiting noisy places, if possible.


Get regular hearing check-ups.

What can I do as a parent to ensure safe listening?,As parents you need to play an active role in educating your children about safe listening and monitoring their exposure to loud noise; you also need to be role models of safe listening for your children. You should make sure that your children avoid the use of headphones when possible and use only headphones that provide information about the risks for hearing loss. Parents should also ensure that their children do not increase the volume when they are not supervised. Some devices may be equipped with parental control that allows parents to control the loudness level of the device.
What can I do as a teacher to ensure safe listening?,As a teacher you can educate children and adolescents about the possible dangers of exposure to loud sounds from the misuse of personal audio devices and be encouraged to develop safe listening habits. Such information should be part of the health education curriculum and also be taught as part of music and dance classes.
Why should I check my hearing?,Many people with hearing loss are unaware of it. Regular hearing checks can ensure that hearing loss is identified as early as possible so that you can take action and continue enjoying the sounds around you.
Who is at risk of hearing loss?,"Any one is at risk of hearing loss, however, hearing loss is most likely to occur in people who:

are above 60 years of age
listen often to loud music
work in noisy environments
take medicines that can damage the ear"
"The test told me to get professional advice, but I can hear well. What does it mean?","Hearing loss means a reduction in the ability to hear. There are different grades of hearing loss:

Mild: some difficulty in understanding soft speech or speech in noisy places
Moderate: difficulty in hearing regular conversations
Severe: difficulty in hearing all except loud sounds
Profound: inability to hear even loud sounds"
How can hearing loss affect my life?,"If hearing loss is not addressed, it can affect people in different ways: children might have difficulties learning; adults might have challenges performing at work and older people might experience isolation and uneasiness. In general, if it is not addressed, hearing loss can make it difficult to understand conversations and fully engage socially. Read the factsheet for more information.

Factsheet"
Can listening to music affect my ears?,"Listening to loud music for long periods tires and damages sensory cells within your ears. At first you might experience just temporary hearing loss, which manifests as muffled sounds or a ringing sensation in the ear (tinnitus). Over time, it causes permanent damage with irreversible hearing loss and tinnitus."
How should I care for my ears?,"You can care for your ears by:

Making sure that you never insert any object into your ear (not even a cotton swab)
Keeping the volume low and limiting the time spent listening (find additional information in the link below)
Using earplugs in noisy places or when doing noisy activities
Visiting a doctor in case of any pain or discharge from the ear
Seeking help from a health care professional, if you feel that you may not be hearing well or have tinnitus

Information on safe listening"
How is hearing loss diagnosed?,"A professional hearing assessment is required to diagnose hearing loss. A very common test is the audiometry - it identifies the minimum sound level (in decibels) at which you can hear different sound frequencies (pitch). It is used to identify the presence, type and grade of hearing loss. The hearWHO app uses a different test to diagnose hearing loss."
What can I do as a physician to ensure safe listening?,"You may have a significant opportunity to educate and counsel adolescents and young adults regarding hearing protection. You can convey appropriate messages about the risks and promote healthy listening habits among users. You can also advise people about the importance of regular hearing checks and guide them about where and how they can get these. If you suspect that any person has hearing loss, they should be referred to the proper health facility where they can receive diagnostic and rehabilitative services."
What can I do as a manager of an entertainment venue to ensure safe listening?,"Managers of venues in which noise levels are high – nightclubs, discotheques, bars, pubs, cinemas, concerts, sporting events and even fitness classes – have an important role to play in ensuring the personal safety of people who frequent such venues. To make listening safe, you can: monitor and apply the safe noise limit set by the establishment itself; make use of sound limiters to control noise levels in such settings; provide free earplugs to all patrons along with information about their proper use as well as “chill out” rooms, where volume levels are monitored and safe; and prominently display messages about the risk of hearing loss during moments when the volume goes beyond safe levels."
What can I do as a manufacturer of personal audio devices to ensure safe listening?,"As a manufacturer of personal audio devices, you will have the technical know-how to design these devices with appropriate safety features. For example, devices can display an on-screen message displaying the average dB level at different volume settings, along with a warning to keep the output below 80 dB. Such measures offer protection and help raise awareness about the harmful effects of loud music and other noise. You can also provide prominent warning labels on the products themselves, as well as on the external packaging and accompanying information materials."
What can governments do to ensure safe listening?,"Governments are encouraged to develop stricter laws and rigorously enforce already existing legislation regarding non-occupational noise. They should ensure that the personal audio devices available in the country should comply with existing safe listening standard. Governments must also raise awareness about the issue through targeted public information campaigns highlighting the potential consequences of hearing loss.
Efforts should be made to made to integrate ear and hearing care into the health care strategy of the country. Such efforts must focus on prevention of hearing loss as well as its early identification and appropriate management. Governments can ensure that hearing devices and services required by people with hearing loss should be accessible to them, as part of universal health coverage."
What happens if I get hearing loss?,"The management of hearing loss depends upon its cause, type and grade. You should consult a health care professional who can advise you about the most suitable interventions."
I don’t know where to get my hearing tested? What shall I do?,"A hearing test is likely to be available at a medical facility such as a secondary or tertiary level hospital. If you are not sure, it would be best to ask a health care professional about where such a test can be done."
How does hearWHO help?,"The hearWHO app is based on digits-in-noise hearing screening technology. The screening presents three digits over background noise, to which you are prompted to respond. The screening determines your signal to noise ratio which is indicative of your hearing ability. Should you not receive a favourable outcome from this screening, you should seek medical attention from a health care professional."
How accurate is hearWHO?,"This ‘digits-in-noise’ test has a sensitivity and specificity of over 85%.* However, WHO and the developers of this app cannot be held responsible or liable for any incorrect results. hearWHO is intended for use by people 18 years of age and above. This version of the hearWHO app is not for use for hearing checks for children, as it will not provide reliable results.
*: Potgieter et al 2016; Potgieter et al 2017; Potgieter et al 2018"
"If I adjust my device to a higher comfortable volume, will my hearing score improve?","No, the test evaluates your ability to hear speech in background noise. As long as the speech is at a comfortable listening level, the volume should not affect the outcome."
What happens if I make lucky guesses? Won’t that give me a wrong score?,The test has been developed and normed according to the instruction to guess if you are uncertain. The chances of correctly guessing several digits in a closed set of 10 options are highly unlikely.
Why does the test include 23 sets of digits? Why not more or less?,This has been one of the standard test development approaches for digits-in-noise testing across several countries. It ensures a sufficient number of trials for a reliable speech reception threshold.
How can I keep my child's ears clean?,"The ear is a self-cleaning organ and does not require any active cleaning. The ear only needs to be cleaned from outside. No object or fluid should be inserted or instilled into the ears, unless prescribed by a health professional."
Why does my child get pain in the ear?,"Pain in the ear can be caused by problems such as:

impacted cerumen (wax) in the ear;
acute infection in the ear canal;
acute infection of the ear drum; or
because of fluid in the middle ear.

In order to identify the problem, your child should be taken for an ear check-up. Ear pain should not be ignored as it can lead to serious problems."
How can I prevent ear infections in my child?,"Most ear infections can be prevented by taking good care of our ears. Some important things to remember are:

do not let dirty water enter the ear;
do not slap a child, especially over the ears, as it can damage the ear drum, thereby encouraging infections;
ensure early diagnosis of ear infections by staying vigilant for problems like pain in the ear, decreased hearing and wetness in the ear; and
educate children about not inserting anything into the ear such as pencils, erasers, hair-pins etc."
Can I use traditional/herbal remedies in the ear?,No! These may irritate the ear canal and the ear drum and cause infection.
When should I take my child to see the doctor regarding ear problems?,"If your child complains of:

pain in the ear;
discharge from the ear;
hearing loss;
improper speech development;
if your child does not understand what you say properly.

Consult a doctor, as soon as possible."
How long can someone be around a loud noise before it becomes hazardous?,"The degree of hearing hazard is related to both: the level of the noise as well as the duration of the exposure. It is better to protect against loud noise as soon as one is exposed to it. Ear protectors, such as well-fitted ear plugs, should be worn before entering a noisy area."
I enjoy listening to loud music through ear/headphones. Will it harm my hearing ability?,"The risk of hearing loss increases as sound is played at high intensity (volume) and for long durations. It has been shown that listening through earphones at 95% of maximum sound volume for 5 minutes (with most devices) continuously will damage hearing. To protect hearing, volume should be minimized and breaks should be taken while listening through ear/headphones."
What are the early indications of age related hearing loss (presbycusis)?,"In the initial stages, a person with hearing loss may have difficulty in understanding words. He/she is often able to hear the sounds but unable to make out the words. This may be more evident when the background noise is high (eg in a restaurant).
Such a person may also start speaking in a louder voice than normal, without being aware of it.
A ringing sensation in the ear (tinnitus) and inability to hear high pitched sounds can also indicate presbycusis."
When should I get my ears tested?,"You should get your ears tested if:

you often have to ask people to repeat themselves
find yourself raising the volume of the television to higher than normal levels
regularly miss parts of conversations
experience a ringing sensation in the ear (tinnitus)
people tell you that you are speaking loudly."
Can age-related hearing loss be reversed? Can it be treated?,"Age related hearing loss cannot be reversed, as it is caused by degeneration of sensory cells, which occurs with age. However, it can be treated effectively by use of hearing aids and other communication devices."
What measures can help me to prevent or delay the onset of hearing loss in my old age?,"Taking good care of your ears and following good ear and hearing practices such as:

protecting your ears from loud sounds;
never inserting anything into your ear or instill any liquids, other than medicines prescribed by a trained health care personnel;
in case of pain in the ear or ear-discharge, seeking medical treatment urgently;
eating healthy food and exercising well to avoid diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, that predispose to development of hearing loss; and
avoiding cigarette smoking."
My parents have hearing loss. What care should I take when speaking with them?,"When you speak to a person with hearing loss, make sure that:

you face them while speaking
your face is neither covered nor in the dark when you speak
don't speak with your mouth full
speak in a loud, clear voice, but don't shout
try to minimize the background noise by turning off the television or radio."
What is diphtheria?,"Diphtheria is an infection caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae.
 Signs and symptoms usually start 2 – 5 days after exposure and range 
from mild to severe. Symptoms often come on gradually, beginning with a 
sore throat and fever. In severe cases, the bacteria produces a poison 
(toxin) that causes a thick grey or white patch at the back of 
throat. This can block the airway making it hard to breathe or swallow 
and also create a barking cough. The neck may swell in part due to 
enlarged lymph nodes.
The poison may also get into the blood stream 
causing complications that may include inflammation and damage of the 
heart muscle, inflammation of nerves, kidney problems, and bleeding 
problems due to low blood platelets. The damaged heart muscles may 
result in an abnormal heart rate and inflammation of the nerves may 
result in paralysis."
How is diphtheria spread?,"Diphtheria spreads easily between people by direct contact 
or through the air though respiratory droplets, like from coughing or 
sneezing.  It may also be spread by contaminated clothing and objects."
How is diphtheria diagnosed?,"Clinical diagnosis of diphtheria usually relies on the presence of
 a greyish membrane covering the throat. Although laboratory 
investigation of suspected cases is recommended for case confirmation, 
treatment should be started immediately."
How is diphtheria treated?,"Diphtheria infection is treated with the administration of a 
diphtheria antitoxin, administered intravenously or through an 
intramuscular injection. Antibiotics are also given to eliminate the 
bacteria and toxin production, and to prevent transmission to others."
Are diphtheria vaccines recommended?,"All children worldwide should be immunized against diphtheria.
 A 3-dose primary series during infancy is the foundation for building 
lifelong immunity to diphtheria. Further, immunization programmes should
 ensure that 3 booster doses of diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine are
 provided during childhood and adolescence. At any age those who are 
unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated against diphtheria should 
receive the doses necessary to complete their vaccination.  
Recent diphtheria outbreaks in several countries reflect 
inadequate vaccination coverage and have demonstrated the importance of 
sustaining high levels of coverage in childhood immunization programmes.
 Those who are unimmunized are at risk regardless of the setting. An 
estimated 86% of children worldwide receive the recommended 3 doses of 
diphtheria-containing vaccine when they are infants, leaving 14% with no
 or incomplete coverage."
Do health-care workers need to take extra precautions?,"In endemic settings and outbreaks, health-care workers may be
at greater risk of diphtheria than the general population. Consequently,
special attention should be paid to immunizing health-care workers who
may have occupational exposure to Corynebacterium diphtheriae."
Home is not a safe place for me. What can I do?,"If you are experiencing violence, it may be helpful to reach out to family, friends and neighbors, to seek support from a hotline or, if safe, from online service for survivors of violence. Find out if local services (e.g. shelters, counselling) are open and reach out to them if available. Make a safety plan in case the violence against you or your children escalates. This includes: Identifying a neighbour, friend, relative, colleague, or shelter to go to in case you need to leave the house immediately for safety. Have a plan for how you will exit the house safely and how you will reach there (e.g. transport).  Keep a few essential items (e.g. identification documents, phone, money, medicines, and clothes) available, and a list of telephone numbers in case of an emergency.  If possible, develop a code with a trusted neighbour so they can come to your aid in case of an emergency."
I need medical attention because of violence. Who can help me and where should I go?,"If you need urgent medical attention, call for an ambulance or contact your country’s emergency health services. If you need any other support, contact a specialized service if available or a health provider."
"I am safe, but I am suffering from mental / sexual / social / long-term physical health problems because of violence. Is there anyone who can help me during COVID-19?","As much as possible, reduce sources of stress: Maintain contact with and seek support from family and friends via phone, email, text, etc. Try to maintain daily routines and make time for physical activity and sleep. Use relaxation exercises (e.g. slow breathing, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, grounding exercises – see WHO Clinical handbook p.70) to relieve stressful thoughts and feelings. Engage in activities that in the past have helped with managing adversity. Seek information about COVID- 19 from reliable sources and reduce the time spent consuming news (for example, 1-2 times per day, rather than every hour). Seek care from a trained health provider for symptoms and conditions including injuries that need medical attention. Due to restrictions on movement, and pressure on health systems, it may be difficult to access healthcare in person at this time. In this case, find out what is available in your locality and seek alternatives, including information and support offered by phone or online.  If you are currently receiving healthcare and support for violence-related issues this could continue during COVID-19 – this could even be by phone or online if feasible and appropriate for your health needs."
I am worried about someone I know. How can I help?,"If you know of, or are concerned about, someone in an abusive relationship there are some things you can do: Keep regularly in touch with the person to check that they are safe, ensuring that it is safe for them to be in touch with you. Assume that a perpetrator of violence can see, hear and or monitor communications, so find out how best to communicate with the person that you are concerned about.  Send them an SMS or message via email or social media, in a way that is safe for them. Be discrete in connecting with them when the abuser is present in the home so that they are not placed at risk of additional harm. Check each time, as this may change. Find out what services for survivors of violence against women (e.g. shelters, hotlines, counselling services, women’s organizations) are functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic and make this information available through your networks and social media. Only provide this information directly if you can do so discretely without the abuser finding out.  If someone you know needs urgent help for whatever reason, be prepared to call emergency health services, the police, health centre, or hotline."
I want to report an incidence of violence during COVID-19. What should I do?,"If you want to report an incidence of violence, you should follow your country’s guidance on how to report violence and contact the service where you are most likely to get a survivor-centred response.  Some countries are making exceptions to movement restrictions for reporting of violence specifically. Remember that reporting may put you at risk, so ensure you have a safety plan in place. You may find making a report mentally or emotionally difficult. Seek the support of friends, relations, neighbours or colleagues, or local support services for survivors of violence."
I have harmed or am worried about harming or hurting my partner (and children) with my words or actions. How can I stop?,"If you feel yourself getting angry or very annoyed, step away into another room if you can, or outside for a deep breath.  Count to ten and breathe in and out until you feel calmer. Count down from 10, or do anything else that may help you stay calm. Talk to a trusted friend, relative, or religious leader and if necessary seek help from local health services or specialized services if available.  Recognize that everyone in your family is experiencing stress during this time. Demonstrate kindness and patience in your words and actions.  Eliminate or reduce your alcohol consumption as much as possible. The current measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic, such as restrictions on movement, as well as financial instability caused by the crisis, are likely to add to your stress.  This is normal, and you can control how you react.  Take measures to ensure you manage your stress in a way that is respectful and safe to you and your family. Try to be kind to yourself, your partner, children and anyone else in the family."
I am a health worker. How can I help women survivors of violence during COVID-19?,"As a health worker, there are things you can do to help mitigate the impacts of violence on women and children at any time, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.   Whilst your time and resources may be stretched during this health emergency, you have a duty of care to women who may seek help from you – often to address physical and mental hurt caused by violence.   You may need to adjust how you deliver services, if face-to-face care is not possible. Depending on your resources consider mobile phone, WhatsApp or other communication channels to deliver support, always ensuring you can do this in a way that is safe for the survivor. Communicate openly with women about any changes in service delivery.   If a woman with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 seeks your care because of violence, your response should be the same as for any other survivor. You should however ensure that you are protected from infection, by maintaining distance where possible, wearing protective clothing, practicing respiratory hygiene, and washing hands and surfaces with soap and water regularly and after touching, to avoid infection. In any circumstances, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, health workers should provide first-line support, using the LIVES approach to help women survivors of violence:  Listen closely, with empathy and no judgement Inquire about women’s needs and concerns Validate women’s experiences. Show you believe and understand. Enhance their safety. Support women to connect with additional services."
I run a health facility. What can I do to support women survivors of violence during COVID-19?,"Identify information on local services for survivors, including on hotlines, shelters, rape crisis centers, and counselling.  Find out opening hours, contact details and whether these services can be offered remotely, and establish referral linkages.  Make these available to health care providers and easily accessible to patients/clients coming to your facility.  Support the health care providers in your facility to continue to support women survivors of violence during this time. Be prepared to shift rapidly to providing care through alternative ways, by creating effective response plans; for example, by ensuring frontline healthcare workers have phones and can charge them.  Ensure there is a protocol in place to ensure continued safe document storage in case of sudden lockdown. Inform survivors of ways they can protect themselves, and provide small credit card-size cards listing relevant phone numbers for support"
I am a policy maker. What can I do to prevent and address violence against women during COVID-19?,"When making preparedness and response plans for the COVID-19 pandemic, include essential services for violence against women. Allocate adequate resources for services for survivors and identify ways to make them accessible – particularly in the context of measures to restrict people’s movement. Explore the use of telemedicine, digital health, or mhealth to enhance access to support and services for survivors, while ensuring this is safe for them.  Explore alternative shelters for women who may require this. Ensure that lockdown measures do not penalize women for seeking support when experiencing violence, such as by going to the police or hospital to report violence."
Has violence against women increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Violence against women is highly prevalent, and intimate partner violence is the most common form of violence. During health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, violence against women tends to increase.  Whilst data are scarce, reports from across the world, including China, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and other countries suggest a significant increase in domestic violence cases related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reports from other countries suggest a reduction in survivors seeking services due to a combination of lockdown measures and not wanting to attend health services for fear of infection."
How does COVID-19 increase risks of violence for women?,"Stress, the disruption of social and protective networks, loss of income and decreased access to services all can exacerbate the risk of violence for women. In many countries, where people are encouraged or required to stay at home, the risk of intimate partner violence is likely to increase. Please see the following resource for more detail: https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/emergencies/COVID-19-VAW-full-text.pdf In addition, access to sexual and reproductive health services will likely become more limited. Other services, such as hotlines, crisis centers, shelters, legal aid, and protection services, may also be reduced, making it difficult for women to access the few sources of help that would usually be available."
Who is most vulnerable?,"Women who are displaced, who are migrants or refugees, and those living in conflict-affected areas, older women and women with disabilities are particularly at risk of violence and are likely to be disproportionately affected by violence during COVID-19."
Why should I care about violence against women during COVID-19?,"Violence against women is a grave violation of women’s human rights, no matter when, where, or how it takes place. There are many forms of violence against women, which have many potential negative health consequences for women and their children.  Violence against women can result in injuries and serious physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems, including sexually transmitted infections, HIV, and unplanned pregnancies. In extreme cases, violence against women can result in death. The effects of violence are very often long-lived. Violence – in all its forms – can have an impact on a woman’s well-being throughout the rest of her life. This is unacceptable, and the risks of violence that women and their children face during the current COVID-19 crisis cannot be ignored. When we are able to prevent violence, or to support women survivors of violence, we help to safeguard women’s human rights, and promote physical and mental health and well-being for women throughout their lives. This also helps to alleviate pressure on already stretched essential public services, including the health system."
What is ventilation?,Ventilation is the intentional introduction of fresh air into a space while the stale air is removed. It is done to maintain the quality of air in that space.
What is WHO doing to address ventilation in the context of COVID-19?,"WHO has contributed to guidance on ventilation and air-conditioning systems in the context of COVID-19, available here.WHO works closely with the World Meteorological Organization Joint Office for Climate and Health and the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Global Heat Health Information Network to develop and update this guidance."
What steps can be undertaken to improve the ventilation in indoor public spaces and buildings?,"Ventilation is an important factor in preventing the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading indoors.  Below are steps to consider which can improve indoor ventilation. These steps should be considered in consultation with a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) professional.Consider using natural ventilation, opening windows if possible and safe to do so.For mechanical systems, increase the percentage of outdoor air, using economizer modes of HVAC operations and potentially as high as 100%. Before increasing outdoor air percentage, verify compatibility with HVAC system capabilities for both temperature and humidity control as well as compatibility with outdoor/indoor air quality considerations.Increase total airflow supply to occupied spaces, if possible.Disable demand-control ventilation controls that reduce air supply based on temperature or occupancy.Improve central air filtration:Increase air filtration to as high as possible without significantly diminishing design airflow.Inspect filter housing and racks to ensure appropriate filter fit and check for ways to minimize filter bypass.Consider running the HVAC system at maximum outside airflow for 2 hours before and after spaces are occupied, in accordance with manufactory recommendations.Generate clean-to-less-clean air movements by re-evaluating the positioning of supply and exhaust air diffusers and/or dampers and adjusting zone supply and exhaust flow rates to establish measurable pressure differentials. Have staff work in “clean” ventilation zones that do not include higher-risk areas such as visitor reception or exercise facilities (if open).Ensure exhaust fans in restroom facilities are functional and operating at full capacity when the building is occupied."
"Are there any recommendations for offices, schools and the accommodation sector regarding ventilation and air conditioning use?","In all workplaces, schools and tourist accommodations, there should be fresh, clean air. WHO recommends an increased ventilation rate through natural or mechanical means, preferably without recirculation of the air. In case of air recirculation, filters should be cleaned regularly, especially for jobs that place an individual at a medium or high risk of exposure to COVID-19. Examples of such jobs may include frontline workers in retail, tourist accommodation and domestic workers."
What is WHO doing to address ventilation in the context of COVID-19?,"WHO has contributed to guidance on ventilation and air-conditioning systems in the context of COVID-19, available here. WHO works closely with the World Meteorological Organization Joint Office for Climate and Health and the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Global Heat Health Information Network to develop and update this guidance.Additional information is available in the WHO interim guidance on infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies during health care when coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is suspected or confirmed. This guidance is intended for health workers, including health-care managers and infection prevention and control teams at the facility level, but is also relevant for the national and district/provincial levels."
What are the recommended air ventilation requirements for health facilities?,"In health facilities, large quantities of fresh and clean outdoor air are required to control contaminants and odours. There are three basic criteria for ventilation:ventilation rate: the amount and quality of outdoor air provided into the space;airflow direction: the direction of airflow should be from clean to less-clean zones; andair distribution or airflow pattern: the supply of air to each part of the space to improve dilution and removal of pollutants from the space.For health facilities in general, where aerosol generating procedures are not performed, ventilation of 60 litres/second per patient (L/s/patient) is adequate for naturally-ventilated areas, or 6 air changes per hour for mechanically-ventilated areas.For areas where aerosol generating procedures are performed, recommended ventilation rates are as follows:Naturally ventilated facilities/areas: the recommended average natural ventilation rate is 160 L/s/patient. Use of natural ventilation depends on favourable climate conditions (e.g. no risk of heat stress, no air pollution). Contaminated air should exhaust directly to the outside, away from air-intake vents, clinical areas, and people. Mechanically ventilated facilities/areas: where mechanical ventilation is available, negative pressure should be created to control the direction of airflow. The ventilation rate should be 6-12 air changes per hour, ideally 12 air changes per hour for new constructions, with a recommended negative pressure differential of ≥2.5Pa (0.01-inch water gauge) to ensure that air flows from the corridor into the patient room. Air from the facility/area or patient room can be exhausted directly to the outdoors, where droplet nuclei will be diluted in the outdoor air, or passed internally through a special HEPA filter that removes most (99.97%) of droplet nuclei (aerosols) before it is returned to general circulation. If a HEPA filter is not used, the air should be exhausted directly to the outside away from air-intake vents, people and animals."
Can the use of air conditioning increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in health facilities?,"Some health facilities may use heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems to maintain indoor air temperature and humidity at healthy and comfortable levels for staff, patients and visitors. A well-maintained and operated system may reduce the risk of transmission in indoor spaces by increasing the rate of air change, reducing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air. HVAC systems should be regularly inspected, maintained, and cleaned. Rigorous standards for installation and maintenance of ventilation systems are essential to ensure that they are effective and contribute to a safe environment within the health facility as a whole."
Can fans be used in health facilities?,"In health facilities, use of desk or pedestal fans for air circulation should be avoided if possible unless it is in a single occupancy room when there are no visitors or staff present. If the use of desk or pedestal fans is unavoidable, ensure that the fan is directed away from the corridor or any area where people may pass by since the unfiltered air could potentially expose a passerby to the COVID-19 virus. In addition, outdoor air exchange should be increased by opening windows when fans are used.The use of ceiling fans can improve circulation of outside air and avoid pockets of stagnant air in occupied space. However, it is critical to maintain good outdoor ventilation when using ceiling fans.  An efficient way to increase outdoor air exchange is by opening windows. However, doors should be closed to avoid air from COVID-19 patient rooms to other areas in the health facility."
What medical procedures are considered aerosol generating in health facilities?,"Some medical procedures can generate infectious aerosols and have been associated with a higher risk of transmission of coronaviruses (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2).  Although there is no comprehensive list of aerosol-generating procedures, current data suggest that the following procedures can generate infectious aerosols:tracheal intubationnon-invasive ventilationtracheotomycardiopulmonary resuscitationmanual ventilation before intubationsputum inductionbronchoscopyautopsy proceduresdental procedures that use spray-generating equipmentIt is not yet known whether aerosols generated by nebulizer therapy or high-flow oxygen delivery are infectious, as data on this is still limited."
What is ventilation?,Ventilation is the intentional introduction of fresh air into a space while the stale air is removed. It is done to maintain the quality of air in that space.
What is WHO doing to address ventilation in the context of COVID-19?,"WHO has contributed to guidance on ventilation and air-conditioning systems in the context of COVID-19, available here.WHO works closely with the World Meteorological Organization Joint Office for Climate and Health and the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Global Heat Health Information Network to develop and update this guidance.More Q&As on COVID-19 and ventilation in public spaces and buildings are available here."
Can I use air conditioning in the context of COVID-19?,"Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are used to maintain indoor air temperature and humidity at healthy and comfortable levels. A well-maintained and operated system can reduce the spread of COVID-19 in indoor spaces by increasing the rate of  air change, reducing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air. Recirculation modes (which recirculate the air) should not be used. HVAC systems should be regularly inspected, maintained, and cleaned."
Can fans be used safely in indoor spaces?,"At home, table or pedestal fans are safe for air circulation among family members living together who are not infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, fans should be avoided when people who are not part of the immediate family are visiting, since some people could have the virus despite not having symptoms. Air blowing from an infected person directly at another in closed spaces may increase the transmission of the virus from one person to another. At home, offices or school, if the use of table or pedestal fan is unavoidable, it is important to increase outdoor air changes by opening windows and minimize the air blowing from one person (or group of people) to another person (or group of people).The use of ceiling fans can improve circulation of outside air and avoid pockets of stagnant air in occupied space. However, it is critical to maintain good outdoor ventilation when using ceiling fans.  An efficient way to increase outdoor air exchange is by opening windows."
How can ventilation reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 in airplanes?,"Some airplanes have cabin air filtration systems equipped with HEPA filters which can remove viruses and germs quickly, minimizing the duration of the exposure to any potential infectious materials produced by a cough or sneeze. The cabin air system is designed to operate most efficiently by delivering approximately 50 percent outside air and 50 percent filtered, recirculated air. The air supply is essentially sterile and particle-free.  However, adequate ventilation is just one of the preventive measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.  Other important measures include maintaining physical distance of at least 1 meter whenever possible, frequent hand hygiene and wearing a mask. Passengers should check with the airline company and the national or local guidelines about when and where to wear a mask while flying."
Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?,"Not yet. Many potential vaccines for COVID-19 are being studied, and several large clinical trials may report results later this year. If a vaccine is proven safe and effective, it must be approved by national regulators, manufactured to exacting standards, and distributed. WHO is working with partners around the world to help coordinate key steps in this process. Once a safe and effective vaccine is available, WHO will work to facilitate equitable access for the billions of people who will need it. More information about COVID-19 vaccine development is available here."
When will COVID-19 vaccines be ready for distribution?,"We don’t yet know exactly when a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine will be ready for distribution, but we estimate that it could be in early to mid-2021. Before COVID-19 vaccines can be delivered, several important challenges must be overcome:The vaccines must be proven safe and effective in large (phase III) clinical trials. Many potential vaccines for COVID-19 are being studied, and some of the large clinical trials may report results in late 2020 or early 2021.A series of independent reviews of the efficacy and safety evidence is required, including regulatory review and approval in the country where the vaccine is manufactured, before WHO considers a vaccine product for prequalification. Part of this process also involves the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety.An external panel of experts convened by WHO, called SAGE, will analyze the results from clinical trials and along with evidence on the disease, age groups affected, risk factors for disease, and other information, they will recommend whether and how the vaccines should be used. Officials in individual countries will decide whether to approve the vaccines for national use and develop policies for how to use the vaccines in their country based on the WHO recommendations.The vaccines must be manufactured in large quantities, which will be a major and unprecedented challenge – all the while continuing to produce all the other important life-saving vaccines already in use.As a final step, vaccines will be distributed through a complex logistical process, with rigorous stock management and temperature control.WHO is working with partners around the world to accelerate every step of this process, while also ensuring the highest safety standards are met. More information is available here."
"How likely is it that safe, effective vaccines for COVID-19 will be developed?","WHO is cautiously optimistic that safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 will be successfully developed. There is a robust pipeline of potential vaccines in development, and some have already advanced to large (phase III) clinical trials based on promising early data. But for now, we can’t be certain if or when a COVID-19 vaccine will be available. That is why we must not rely on a future vaccine to fight this pandemic – we must use all the tools we already have at our disposal, such as testing, contact tracing, physical distancing, and the use of masks.More information about COVID-19 vaccine development is available here."
How quickly could COVID-19 vaccines stop the pandemic?,"The impact of COVID-19 vaccines on the pandemic will depend on several factors.  These include factors such as the effectiveness of the vaccines; how quickly they are approved, manufactured, and delivered; and how many people get vaccinated.  Most scientists anticipate that, like most other vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines will not be 100% effective. WHO is working to help ensure that any approved vaccines are as effective as possible, so they can have the greatest impact on the pandemic."
What types of COVID-19 vaccines are being developed? How would they work?,"Scientists around the world are developing many potential vaccines for COVID-19. These vaccines are all designed to teach the body’s immune system to safely recognize and block the virus that causes COVID-19.Several different types of potential vaccines for COVID-19 are in development, including:Inactivated or weakened virus vaccines, which use a form of the virus that has been inactivated or weakened so it doesn’t cause disease, but still generates an immune response.Protein-based vaccines, which use harmless fragments of proteins or protein shells that mimic the COVID-19 virus to safely generate an immune response.Viral vector vaccines, which use a virus that has been genetically engineered so that it can’t cause disease, but produces coronavirus proteins to safely generate an immune response.RNA and DNA vaccines, a cutting-edge approach that uses genetically engineered RNA or DNA to generate a protein that itself safely prompts an immune response.For more information about all COVID-19 vaccines in development, see this WHO publication, which is being updated regularly."
How will we know if COVID-19 vaccines are safe?,"There are many strict protections in place to help ensure that COVID-19 vaccines will be safe. Like all vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines should go through a rigorous, multi-stage testing process, including large (phase III) trials that involve tens of thousands of people. These trials, which include people at high risk for COVID-19, are specifically designed to identify any common side effects or other safety concerns.If a clinical trial shows that a COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective, a series of independent reviews of the efficacy and safety evidence is required, including regulatory review and approval in the country where the vaccine is manufactured, before WHO considers a vaccine product for prequalification. Part of this process also involves a review of all the safety evidence by the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety.An external panel of experts convened by WHO will analyze the results from clinical trials and along with evidence on the disease, age groups affected, risk factors for disease, and other information, will recommend whether and how the vaccines should be used. Officials in individual countries will decide whether to approve the vaccines for national use and develop policies for how to use the vaccines in their country based on the WHO recommendations.After a COVID-19 vaccine is introduced, WHO will support work with vaccine manufacturers, health officials in each country, and other partners to monitor for any safety concerns on an ongoing basis."
Will other vaccines help protect me from COVID-19?,"Currently, there is no evidence that any existing vaccines will protect against COVID-19. However, scientists are studying whether some existing vaccines – such as the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, which is used to prevent tuberculosis – are also effective for COVID-19.  WHO will evaluate evidence from these studies when available."
Will COVID-19 vaccines provide long-term protection?,"It’s too early to know if COVID-19 vaccines will provide long-term protection. Additional research is needed to answer this question. However, it’s encouraging that available data suggest that most people who recover from COVID-19 develop an immune response that provides at least some protection against reinfection – although we’re still learning how strong this protection is, and how long it lasts. It’s also not yet clear how many doses of a COVID-19 vaccine will be needed. Most COVID-19 vaccine being tested now are using two dose regimens."
How is the research and development process being accelerated without compromising safety?,"WHO and its partners are committed to accelerating the development of a COVID-19 vaccine while maintaining the highest standards on safety.In the past, vaccines have been developed through a series of steps that can take many years. Now, given the urgent need for a COVID-19 vaccine, unprecedented financial investments and scientific collaborations are changing how vaccines are developed. This means that some of the steps in the research and development process are happening in parallel, while still maintaining strict clinical and safety standards. For example, some clinical trials are evaluating multiple vaccines at the same time. However, this does not make the studies any less rigorous.More information about COVID-19 vaccine development is available here."
What is WHO doing to help accelerate COVID-19 vaccine research?,"WHO is one of the leaders (with Gavi and CEPI) of a global effort known as COVAX, which is speeding up the search for safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines by pooling resources from many different countries. This includes the COVAX Facility, a global risk-sharing mechanism for pooled procurement and equitable distribution of eventual COVID-19 vaccines. In addition to investing in vaccine research and development, COVAX is helping scale up vaccine manufacturing capabilities and commiting to buy vaccine doses if vaccines are shown to be safe and effective, with the goal of distributing 2 billion doses where they’re needed most, worldwide, by the end of 2021. COVAX is the vaccine pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.In addition, WHO is setting up “Solidarity” clinical trials that will efficiently evaluate potential COVID-19 vaccines at sites across the globe.More information about WHO’s work on COVID-19 vaccine research and development is available here."
What are human challenge studies? What is WHO’s view on these studies?,"In a regular vaccine study, one group of volunteers at risk for a disease is given an experimental vaccine, and another group is not; researchers monitor both groups over time and compare outcomes to see if the vaccine is safe and effective.In a human challenge vaccine study, healthy volunteers are given an experimental vaccine, and then deliberately exposed to the organism causing the disease to see if the vaccine works. Some scientists believe that this approach could accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development, in part because it would require far fewer volunteers than a typical study. However, there are important ethical considerations that must be addressed – particularly for a new disease like COVID-19, which we do not yet fully understand and are still learning how to treat; it may be difficult for the medical community and potential volunteers to properly estimate the potential risks of participating in a COVID-19 human challenge study. For more information, see this WHO publication on the ethics of COVID-19 human challenge studies."
Who should participate in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines?,"Small (phase I) safety studies of COVID-19 vaccines should enroll healthy adult volunteers. Larger (phase II and III) studies should include volunteers that reflect the populations for whom the vaccines are intended. This means enrolling people from diverse geographic areas, racial and ethnic backgrounds, genders, and ages, as well as those with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk for COVID-19. Including these groups in clinical trials is the only way to make sure that a vaccine will be safe and effective for everyone who needs it."
How do I volunteer for a COVID-19 vaccine trial?,"Opportunities to volunteer for a COVID-19 vaccine trial vary from country to country. If you are interested in volunteering, check with local health officials or research institutions."
"If safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 are developed, who should be first to receive them?","If safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 are developed, WHO believes that everyone, everywhere who could benefit from these vaccines should have access as quickly as possible, starting with those at highest risk.  WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has released two key documents to help guide the allocation and prioritization of populations to receive COVID-19 vaccines:•	The Values Framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination, which offers high-level guidance globally on the values and ethical considerations regarding allocation of COVID-19 vaccines between countries, and offers guidance nationally on the prioritization of groups for vaccination within countries while supply is limited.  •	The Roadmap for Prioritizing Population Groups for Vaccines against COVID-19, which suggests public health strategies and target priority groups for different levels of vaccine availability and epidemiologic settings.  Examples of target priority groups include frontline health and care workers at high risk of infection, older adults, and those people at high risk of death because of underlying conditions like heart disease and diabetes.  In addition, WHO led the development of a Fair Allocation Framework  that aims to ensure that successful COVID-19 vaccines and treatments are shared equitably across all countries. This framework a key part of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. The framework advises that once a COVID-19 vaccine is shown to be safe and effective, and authorized for use, all countries should receive doses in proportion to their population size to immunize the highest-priority groups. In the second phase, vaccines would continue to be deployed to all countries so that additional populations can be covered according to national priorities."
What is WHO doing to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines will be allocated fairly?,"WHO is one of the leaders of a global alliance known as COVAX, the vaccine pillar of the ACT-Accelerator collaboration, which is working to accelerate the development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines and ensure that there is fair and equitable access to these vaccines for all countries. COVAX will allocate vaccines across countries according to a framework developed by a group that includes ethicists, scientists, and other health experts and vetted by WHO’s Member States. Under this framework, COVID-19 vaccines will be rolled out in two phases. In the first phase, they will be allocated according to population size to all participating countries at the same time, so as to protect those people at greatest risk of infection and of severe disease. WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) has provided recommendations about which populations should be prioritized first. These include frontline health and care workers at high risk of infection, older adults, and those people at high risk of death because of underlying conditions like heart disease and diabetes. In the second phase of the roll-out, as more doses are produced, the vaccine should go to groups less at risk of being infected or of suffering badly. COVAX aims to provide at least 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021. Although that is not enough for everyone, it may be enough to end the acute stage of the crisis and put the world on the road to ending the pandemic."
How is WHO helping countries prepare for COVID-19 vaccines?,"Along with accelerating COVID-19 vaccine research and helping scale up manufacturing capacity, WHO is working in close partnership with countries, regional colleagues, and other partners to develop needed policies, strengthen regulatory capacity, training courses, and guide countries in all the needed preparations for a programme to deliver COVID-19 vaccines. WHO is developing detailed technical guidance and adaptable planning tools and templates to help countries plan ahead for a vaccine considering the many aspects of readiness that need to be put in place. These areas include planning and implementation, data and monitoring, supply and logistics, and acceptance and demand. To support initial preparations, a vaccine introduction readiness assessment tool (VIRAT) has also been developed and disseminated. Countries will use this tool to determine what components of readiness are complete and what components need further preparation. This will help ensure that COVID-19 vaccines reach those in need as soon as they are approved and available."
"Are people with tuberculosis likely to be at increased risk of COVID-19 infection, illness and death?","While experience on COVID-19 infection in tuberculosis (TB) patients remains limited, it is anticipated that people ill with both TB and COVID-19 may have poorer treatment outcomes, especially if TB treatment is interrupted. Older age, diabetes and chronic      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are linked with more severe COVID-19 and are      also risk factors for poor outcomes in TB.TB patients should take precautions as advised by health authorities to be protected from COVID-19 and continue their TB treatment as prescribed.People ill with COVID-19 and TB show similar symptoms such as cough, fever and
difficulty breathing. Both diseases attack primarily the lungs and although both
biological agents transmit mainly via close contact, the incubation period from
exposure to disease in TB is longer, often with a slow onset."
Do COVID-19 and tuberculosis spread in the same way?,"While both tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 spread by close contact between people the exact mode of transmission differs, explaining some differences in infection control measures to mitigate the two conditions.  TB bacilli remain suspended in the air in droplet nuclei for several hours after a TB patient coughs, sneezes, shouts, or sings, and people who inhale them can get infected. The size of these droplet nuclei is a key factor determining their infectiousness. Their concentration decreases with ventilation and exposure to direct sunlight.  COVID-19 transmission has primarily been attributed to the direct breathing of droplets expelled by someone with COVID-19 (people may be infectious before clinical features become apparent). Droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, exhaling and speaking may land on objects and surfaces, and contacts can get infected with COVID-19 by touching them and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth . Handwashing, in addition to respiratory precautions, are thus important in the control of COVID-19."
What is the potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic on essential tuberculosis services?,"Modelling work suggests that if the COVID-19 pandemic led to a global reduction of 25% in expected TB detection for 3 months – a realistic possibility given the levels of disruption in TB services being observed in multiple countries – then we could expect a 13% increase in TB deaths, bringing us back to the levels of TB mortality that we had 5 years ago. This may even be a conservative estimate as it does not factor in other possible impacts of the pandemic on TB transmission, treatment interruptions and poorer outcomes in people with TB and COVID-19 infection (Predicted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global tuberculosis deaths in 2020, P. Glaziou). Between 2020 and 2025 an additional 1.4 million TB deaths could be registered as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic (Stop TB Partnership analysis).All measures should be taken to ensure continuity of services for people who need preventive and curative treatment for tuberculosis (TB)."
What should health authorities do to provide sustainability of essential tuberculosis services during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"People-centred delivery of tuberculosis (TB) prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care services should be ensured in tandem with the COVID-19 response.Prevention: Measures must be implemented to limit transmission of TB and COVID-19 in congregate settings and health care facilities. Administrative, environmental and personal protection measures apply to both (e.g. basic infection prevention and control, cough etiquette, patient triage). Provision of TB preventive treatment should be maintained as much as possible.Diagnosis: Tests for TB and COVID-9 are different and both should be made available for individuals with respiratory symptoms, which may be similar for the two diseases. Treatment and care: People-centred outpatient and community-based care should be strongly preferred over hospital treatment for TB patients (unless serious conditions require hospitalization) to reduce opportunities for transmission. Anti-TB treatment, in line with the latest WHO guidelines, must be provided for all TB patients, including those in quarantine and those with confirmed COVID-19 disease. Adequate stocks of TB medicines should be provided to all patients to reduce trips to collect medicines.Use of digital health technologies for patients and programmes should be intensified. In line with WHO recommendations, technologies like electronic medication monitors and video-supported therapy can help patients complete their TB treatment."
How can health authorities ensure supplies of tuberculosis medicines and diagnostics?,"Appropriate planning and monitoring are essential to ensure that procurement and supply of tuberculosis (TB) medicines and diagnostics are not interrupted. WHO is monitoring medicine supply at the global level, while The Global Fund, the Stop TB Partnership Global Drug Facility (GDF), USAID, Unitaid and other donors play an essential role in supporting countries to secure adequate and sustainable supplies of TB medicines, drugs and diagnostics. Countries are advised to place their orders for 2020 delivery as soon as possible given anticipated delays in transport and delivery mechanisms."
What services can be leveraged across both diseases?,"The response to COVID-19 can benefit from the capacity building efforts developed for tuberculosis (TB) over many years of investment by national authorities and donors. These include infection prevention and control, contact tracing, household and community-based care, and surveillance and monitoring systems.Although modes of transmission of the two diseases are slightly different, administrative, environmental and personal protection measures apply to both (e.g. basic infection prevention and control, cough etiquette, patient triage). TB laboratory networks have been established in countries with the support of WHO and international partners. These networks as well as specimen transportation mechanisms could also be used for COVID-19 diagnosis and surveillance.Respiratory physicians, pulmonology staff of all grades, TB specialists and health workers at the primary health care level may be points of reference for patients with pulmonary complications of COVID-19. They should familiarize themselves with the most current WHO recommendations for the supportive treatment and containment of COVID-19. TB programme staff with their experience and capacity, including in active case finding and contact tracing, are well placed to support the COVID-19 response.Various digital technologies used in TB programmes can      support the COVID-19 response, including adherence support, electronic      medical records and eLearning."
"What measures should be in place to protect staff working in tuberculosis laboratories and healthcare facilities, and community health workers, from COVID-19 infection?","Health care facilities, including those that diagnose and care for tuberculosis (TB) and lung diseases, are bound to receive patients with COVID-19, many of whom may be undiagnosed. Additional measures may be needed to avoid that staff in these centres are exposed to
    COVID-19 infection.The Information Note includes additional, temporary measures that should be considered. These include alternative arrangements to reduce visits for TB follow-up, precautions for sputum collection, transportation and testing. The note also includes a description of ethical obligations in this setting.Existing WHO recommendations for infection prevention and control for TB and for COVID-19 should be strictly implemented, including personal protection equipment. Lessons learnt over many years of TB infection prevention and control, contact tracing, investigation
    and management can benefit efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19."
How can we protect people seeking tuberculosis care during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"In a context of widespread restriction of movement of the population in response to the pandemic and isolation of COVID-19 patients, communication with the healthcare services should be maintained so that people with tuberculosis (TB), especially those most vulnerable, get essential services. This includes management of adverse drug reactions and co-morbidities, nutritional and mental health support, and restocking of the supplies of medicines. Enough TB medicines will need to be dispensed to the patient or caregiver to last until the next visit. This will limit interruption or unnecessary visits to the clinic. Mechanisms to deliver medicines at home and even to collect specimens for follow-up testing may become expedient. Home-based TB treatment is bound to become more common. Alternative arrangements to reduce clinic visits may involve limiting appointments to specific times to avoid exposure to other clinic attendees; using digital technologies to maintain treatment support. Community health workers become more critical as treatment is more decentralized.More TB patients will probably start their treatment at home and therefore limiting the risk of household transmission of TB during the first few weeks is important. Vulnerable populations who have poor access to healthcare should not get further marginalized during the pandemic."
Can tuberculosis and COVID-19 be tested on the same type of specimen?,"The diagnostic methods for tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 are quite distinct and commonly require different specimens.  Sputum, as well as many other biological specimens, can be used to diagnose TB using culture or molecular techniques.Tests for COVID-19 are done most commonly by nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab or wash in ambulatory patients, but sputum or endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage may be used in patients with severe respiratory disease.  Molecular testing is the currently recommended method for the identification of infectious COVID-19 and just as for TB, serological assays are not recommended for the routine diagnosis of COVID-19.The pipeline for COVID-19 diagnostics has flourished impressively within a few months. Amongst these is the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridge for use on GeneXpert machines, which are machines used in TB diagnosis. WHO is currently evaluating this cartridge as well as other tests. Additional resources to roll out COVID-19 testing should be mobilized rather than relying only on existing resources that are used for TB, to ensure that the diagnostic coverage for TB is maintained as necessary."
Should all people being evaluated for tuberculosis also be tested for COVID-19 and vice-versa?,"Testing of the same patient for both tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 would generally be indicated for three main reasons, subject to the specific setting in each country:clinical features that are common to both diseases; or simultaneous exposure to both diseases; orpresence of a risk factor As the pandemic advances, more people of all ages, including TB patients, will be exposed to COVID-19. The Information Note contains further considerations for simultaneous testing for the two diseases."
Is tuberculosis treatment different in people who have both TB and COVID-19?,"In most cases tuberculosis (TB) treatment is not different in people with or without COVID-19 infection. Experience on joint management of both COVID-19 infection and TB remains limited. However, suspension of TB treatment in COVID-19 patients should be exceptional. TB preventive treatment, treatment for drug-susceptible or drug-resistant TB disease should continue uninterrupted to safeguard the patient’s health, reduce transmission and prevent the development of drug-resistance. While treatment trials are ongoing, no medication is currently recommended for COVID-19 and therefore no cautions on drug-drug interactions are indicated at present. TB patients on treatment should nonetheless be asked if they are taking any medicines, including traditional cures, that may interact with their medication.Effective treatments to prevent TB and to treat active TB have been scaled up and are in use worldwide. The risk of death in TB patients approaches 50% if left untreated and may be higher in the elderly or in the presence of comorbidity. It is critical that TB services are not disrupted during the COVID-19 response.  Gathering evidence as this pandemic unfolds will be very important, while upholding the norms of professional conduct and patient confidentiality when handling clinical details."
Does the BCG vaccine protect people from COVID-19?,"There is no evidence at this point that the Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine (BCG) protects people against infection with COVID-19 virus. Clinical trials addressing this question are underway, and WHO will evaluate the evidence when it is available. In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19. WHO continues to recommend reserving BCG for neonatal vaccination in settings with a high risk of tuberculosis.More information"
What can staff do to stay safe while working at a hotel or other accommodation establishment?,"Everyone should follow basic precautions: Wash all parts of your hands frequently (at least 20 seconds if using an alcohol-based hand rub, and at least 40 seconds with soap and water), including after exchanging objects such as money or credit cards with guests.Cover a cough or sneeze with a bent elbow or tissue and throw away the tissue in a closed bin.Maintain at least a 1 metre distance from other staff and guests. This includes avoid hugging, kissing, or shaking hands. If you can’t guarantee the distance, wear a fabric mask. Be sure to check local and national guidelines on the use of masks. Staying behind plexiglass boards at reception and concierge desks can prevent droplet transmission. Teleworking may be a possibility for some jobs, which can help reduce physical contact with others."
Should staff wear a mask while working?,"In areas where the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating, staff aged 60 or over, or who have any underlying health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung cancer, should wear a medical mask because of their higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19. Staff under the age of 60 and who are in general good health can wear fabric masks when they cannot guarantee at least a 1 metre distance from others. This is particularly important for staff who are in close contact or potential close contact with others. Everyone should follow local policies and regulations."
What should staff do if a guest becomes sick at an accommodation establishment?,"If a guest at the accommodation develops symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, dry cough or tiredness, staff at the accommodation establishment should contact the local health authority and follow their instructions. The sick person should be isolated in a room, alone, or at least 1 metre away from others, according to local health authorities’ instructions. No visitors should be permitted to enter the room occupied by the affected guest. Staff should also move people traveling with the sick person to a different room, if possible. It is usually the relevant public health authority, not the management of the hotel and accommodation establishment, which has the authority to demand sick guests to temporarily remain in their room or to prevent them from receiving visits from other guests. National law will guide the rights of the guests to refuse or not the recommended measures.Staff entering the room of an ill person should maintain at least a 1 metre distance from the ill person, and request that the ill person put on a medical mask.  If staff need to assist an ill guest within a 1 metre distance, they should clean their hands before putting on appropriate personal protective equipment (medical mask and eye protection, gloves and isolation gown), and clean their hands after providing assistance. Training should be provided on how to avoid contaminating themselves."
What should staff do if they have symptoms?,"If staff develop COVID-19 symptoms while at work, such as fever, dry cough or tiredness, they should immediately stop working, put on a medical mask and isolate in a suitable room while medical services are notified. Disposable tissues and an appropriate waste bin with a lid should be available in the designated isolation area while waiting for medical assessment or transfer to an assessment facility.If staff develop symptoms while at home, they should stay at home and seek medical attention, following instructions from a health worker that will include a period of time for self-isolation away from others, including family members, according to local guidance.  The staff member should inform the management accordingly."
"As a smoker, is my risk of getting the COVID-19 virus higher than that of a non-smoker?","At the time of preparing this Q&A, there are no peer-reviewed studies that have evaluated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with smoking. However, tobacco smokers (cigarettes, waterpipes, bidis, cigars, heated tobacco products) may be more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19, as the act of smoking involves contact of fingers (and possibly contaminated cigarettes) with the lips, which increases the possibility of transmission of viruses from hand to mouth. Smoking waterpipes, also known as shisha or hookah, often involves the sharing of mouth pieces and hoses, which could facilitate the transmission of the COVID-19 virus in communal and social settings."
"As a smoker, am I likely to get more severe symptoms if infected?",Smoking any kind of tobacco reduces lung capacity and increases the risk of many respiratory infections and can increase the severity of respiratory diseases. COVID-19 is an infectious disease that primarily attacks the lungs. Smoking impairs lung function making it harder for the body to fight off coronaviruses and other respiratory diseases.  Available research suggests that smokers are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 outcomes and death.
"As a vaper, am I more likely to be infected or to have more severe symptoms if infected?","There is no evidence about the relationship between e-cigarette use and COVID-19. However, existing evidence indicates that electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS), more commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, are harmful and increase the risk of heart disease and lung disorders.  Given that the COVID-19 virus affects the respiratory tract, the hand-to-mouth action of e-cigarette use  may increase the risk of infection."
"What about using smokeless tobacco, like chewing tobacco?","Using smokeless tobacco often involves some hand to mouth contact.  Another risk associated with using smokeless tobacco products, like chewing tobacco, is that the virus can be spread when the user spits out the excess saliva produced during the chewing process."
What does WHO recommend for tobacco users?,"Given the risks to health that tobacco use causes, WHO recommends quitting tobacco use.  Quitting will help your lungs and heart to work better from the moment you stop.  Within 20 minutes of quitting, elevated heart rate and blood pressure drop. After 12 hours, the carbon monoxide level in the bloodstream drops to normal. Within 2-12 weeks, circulation improves and lung function increases. After 1-9 months, coughing and shortness of breath decrease. Quitting will help to protect your loved ones, especially children, from exposure to second-hand smoke. WHO recommends the use of proven interventions such as toll-free quit lines, mobile text-messaging cessation programmes, and nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs), among others, for quitting tobacco use."
"What can I do to protect people from the risks associated with smoking, smokeless tobacco use and vaping?","If you smoke, use e cigarettes or use smokeless tobacco, now is a good time to quit completely.Do not share devices like waterpipes and e-cigarettes.Spread the word about the risks of smoking, using e-cigarettes  and using smokeless tobacco.Protect others from the harms of second-hand smoke.Know the importance of washing your hands, physical distancing, and not sharing any smoking or  e -cigarette products.Do not spit in public places"
Does nicotine use affect my chances in the context of COVID-19?,"There is currently insufficient information to confirm any link between tobacco or nicotine in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. WHO urges researchers, scientists and the media to be cautious about amplifying unproven claims that tobacco or nicotine could reduce the risk of COVID-19. WHO is constantly evaluating new research, including that which examines the link between tobacco use, nicotine use, and COVID-19."
What is the EUL?,"The WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) is a procedure for assessing unlicensed vaccines, therapeutics and in vitro diagnostics during public health emergencies with the ultimate goal of expediting the availability of these products to people who need them."
When can the EUL be used?,"The EUL is used during public health emergencies. When products are not licensed yet (still in development), WHO will assess the quality, safety and efficacy (or performance) data generated during development and conduct a risk-benefit assessment to decide if they can be used outside clinical trials."
Do the eligibility criteria for EUL apply to COVID-19 products?,"Yes, all eligibility criteria are applicable. These are: the disease may cause an outbreak, epidemic or pandemic; there are no products available capable of eradicating or preventing the disease; products are manufactured in compliance with good manufacturing practices; and the applicant undertakes to complete the development of the product and apply for prequalification once it is licensed."
Does the EUL provide for products developed after a public health emergency has been declared?,"Yes. The procedure provides for a situation where the vaccine can be assessed after the public health emergency of international concern/pandemic has been declared. In this particular instance, WHO may select a group of experts from the pre-established roster to accelerate the assessment and issue a recommendation within a short timeline."
How soon can a vaccine against Covid-19 be assessed under the EUL?,"The EUL provides an assessment pathway for investigational products. The development of vaccines against Covid-19 did not start until after the outbreak, as the disease is caused by a novel virus. An unprecedented global effort has seen multiple vaccine candidates move into clinical trials (human studies). Early discussions between vaccine developers and WHO PQ are strongly encouraged. For an investigational vaccine to be considered fit for use in a Q&A-EUL-Covid-19 16072020 public health emergency, data should demonstrate that there is a benefit in the target population that outweighs the risk of its use."
Does WHO need to evaluate a product that has already been approved by a WHO listed authority for use during public health emergencies ?,"When a product submitted for EUL has been assessed through other emergency mechanisms by a WHO Listed authority, WHO does not intend to duplicate work. However, WHO will assess the suitability of products from a global public health perspective and, on a case-by-case basis, may assess aspects of the quality, safety, efficacy and performance of the products ."
Do clinical trials continue after a product has been assessed and listed under the EUL procedure?,"Yes. The fact that the vaccines are granted a recommendation to be used in a public health emergency whilst they are still under development is only a temporary measure to ensure availability of preventive tools that present a favorable benefit-risk ratio in the context of the public health emergency (PHE). However, manufacturers commit to continue with the development and if completed successfully, will submit the product for registration and apply for prequalification. Manufacturers are expected to provide detailed guidance and a risk management plan."
Will the evaluation of Covid-19 vaccines continue after the PHE is no longer in effect?,"Once the PHE is no longer in effect, those products assessed during the pandemic are expected to continue their development. Therefore, new quality, safety and efficacy data should be made available for assessment and the risk benefit assessment will be updated. If such products are registered, they will be eligible for prequalification and not for EUL assessment."
Does the EUL procedure ensure rapid availability?,The EUL allows products in development (not licensed) to be assessed by WHO for listing. WHO review is expedited to ensure timely evaluation. The manufacturer’s diligence in addressing WHO’s questions influences the assessment timelines as well. The procurement and distribution processes that have an impact on the timeline for availability of listed products is beyond the scope of the EUL procedure.
How will WHO interact with National Regulatory Authorities?,"WHO actively promotes the principles of reliance for interactions with NRAs based on facilitated regulatory pathways, as was done for Ebola virus disease vaccine. Virtual meetings will be organized with the NRAs from target countries for vaccine deployment. However, identifying the target countries may be complex due to the changing Covid-19 situation. In addition, WHO is mapping the regulatory requirements of countries for emergency use of vaccines during a PHE. Further, subject matter experts from NRAs, and regulatory networks, will be involved in the EUL assessment process of candidate vaccines."
What precautions should everyone take in a hotel or other accommodation establishment?,"Everyone should follow basic precautions: Wash all parts of your hands frequently (at least 20 seconds if using an alcohol-based hand rub, and at least 40 seconds with soap and water), including after exchanging objects such as money or credit cards. Look for hand sanitizer stations and use them before going into dining halls, restaurants or bars.Cover a cough or sneeze with a bent elbow or tissue, and throw away the tissue in a closed bin.Maintain at least a 1 metre distance from staff and other guests. This includes avoiding hugging, kissing, or shaking hands. If you can’t guarantee the distance, wear a mask. Be sure to check local and national guidelines on the use of masks."
Are pools and water areas safe to use?,"Gym, beach, swimming pool, spa, sauna and steam bath facilities can be used safely with certain restrictions, as determined by national guidelines.  In particular, look for the following measures:a maximum number of people allowed to ensure adequate physical distancing fabric mask policies required by local or national regulations hand washing stations, especially in the toilet and change room areassingle use towels only  a bin for guests to place their towel after use for launderingindividual use drinking watertissues and waste containers with lidshigh touch areas such as door handles disinfected regularly throughout the day"
Are there precautions to take while eating in a restaurant?,"There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is transmitted by food, including fresh fruits and vegetables. The virus can be killed while cooking food at temperatures of at least 70°C.Food buffets are not recommended because of the risk of close physical contact with others, shared serving implements and multiple people touching the surfaces on the buffet. Indoor dining spaces should have a maximum of 4 people in 10 square metres. The distance from the back of one chair to the back of another chair should be at least 1 metre apart for both indoor and outdoor dining, and guests that face each other should also be at this distance.Guests should be reminded when entering and leaving the area to clean their hands. When the physical distance of at least 1 metre cannot be guaranteed, masks are recommended to be worn by staff and guests. More on masks, including who should wear what kind and when, is available here."
Is it safe to use fans or air conditioning in an accommodation?,"Ventilation is an important factor in preventing the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading. Recirculated air from split air conditioning units, fan coils or any system that runs with a recirculation mode should be avoided where possible, unless in a single occupancy room with no one else present. If recirculation is unavoidable, increase outdoor air exchange by opening windows, if possible and safe to do so, and minimize air blowing from one person directly at another. Floor or ceiling fans can provide ventilation when the people occupying the room are from the same household, but are not recommended when travelers from different households are together."
Can you get the virus from people who were in the room previous to you?,"Hotels and other accommodations should have procedures for cleaning, disinfecting and ventilating the room properly between every guest’s stay. These processes allow the accommodations to be used immediately afterward. If these procedures are followed, there is no need to leave the room empty between guests."
What should travelers do if they get sick while at an accommodation facility?,"If a guest develops symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, dry cough or tiredness, they should notify the facility manager and seek medical advice by contacting local health authorities. The guest should isolate from others, including fellow travelers. If the guest cannot be isolated or staff need to enter the room, the ill person should put on a medical mask, and people nearby should also wear a mask.  If the medical mask cannot be tolerated by the ill person, then he or she should cough or sneeze into a bent elbow or use tissues to cover the mouth, and discard the tissue immediately into a closed waste bag."

Physical activity includes all forms of active
recreation, sports participation, cycling and walking, as well as activities
you do at work and around the home and garden. It doesn’t have to be exercise
or sport – play, dance, gardening, and even house cleaning and carrying heavy
shopping is all part of being physically active.During the COVID-19 pandemic, when so many of us are
very restricted in our movements, it is even more important for people of all
ages and abilities to be as active as possible. Even a short break from
sitting, by doing 3-5 minutes of physical movement, such as walking or
stretching, will help ease muscle strain, relieve mental tension and improve
blood circulation and muscle activity. Regular physical activity can also help
to give the day a routine and be a way of staying in contact with family and
friends."

Regular physical activity benefits both the body and
mind. It can reduce high blood pressure, help manage weight and reduce the risk
of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers. It also
improves bone and muscle strength and increases balance, flexibility and
fitness. For older people, activities that improve balance help to prevent
falls and injuries. For children, regular physical activity helps support
healthy growth and development and reduce the risk of disease in later life,
and through regular activity, children can develop fundamental movement skills
and build social relationships.Regular physical activity also improves mental health
and can reduce the risk of depression, cognitive decline and delay the onset of
dementia - and improve overall feelings of wellbeing."
How much physical activity is recommended?,"WHO has detailed recommendations on the amount of physical activity people of all ages should do to benefit their health and wellbeing. (available here for children under age of 5 and here for youth, adults and olders) Here are the minimum levels we recommend:Infants under the age of 1 year need to be physically active several times a day.
    Children under 5 years of age should spend at least 180 minutes a day in physical activities, with 3-4 year-olds being moderately or vigorously active for an hour a day.
    Children and adolescents aged 5-17yearsall children and adolescents should do at least 60 minutes a day of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity, including activities that strengthen muscle and bone, at least 3 days per week.Adults aged 18 years and overshould do a total of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity throughout the week, including muscle-strengthening activities 2 or more days per
        week.
    older adults with poor mobility should do physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls on 3 or more days per week.
      But any physical activity is better than none.  Start with small amounts and gradually increase duration, frequency and intensity over time. Being active during the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging for us all.  Because the opportunities to be physically active seem to be more restricted, it is even more important to plan in every day the ways to be active and to reduce the time spent
    sitting for long periods. Put simply, it is a critical time to ensure we all move more and sit less."
What precautions should I take during travel?,"During travel, everyone should clean hands frequently, cough or sneeze into a bent elbow or tissue, and try to maintain a physical distance of at least one metre from others. Travelers should follow the recommendations of the travel authorities regarding policies in the airport and of the airline for the flight."
Who should not travel?,"People with confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 cases should be in isolation and not traveling. Anyone who has had contact with someone else confirmed with COVID-19 cases should be in quarantine and not travel. People aged 60 and over, and those with serious chronic illnesses or underlying health conditions should try to postpone travel, or take special precautions and wear a medical face mask continuously throughout the travel. Check the destination country for policies on what kind of tourism travel is allowed."
What is meant by “essential travel”?,"Essential travel is travel for emergencies and humanitarian actions (including emergency medical flights and medical evacuation). It includes essential personnel (including emergency responders and providers of public health technical support, critical personnel in transport sector such as seafarers and diplomatic officers) and repatriation to a home country."
"If I feel well but am in the high-risk category, should I travel?","People age 60 and over, and those with serious chronic diseases of underlying health conditions, should postpone or delay travel internationally to and from areas with community transmission, where there are many cases of COVID-19.  This is because people in the high-risk group more frequently get very sick after getting the disease, with some dying of it. If you have to travel in these circumstances, you should wear a medical  mask for more protection against the virus. However, masks do not mean you are fully protected. You should also clean your hands frequently, cough or sneeze into a bent elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 metre from others wherever possible."
How can ventilation reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 in airplanes?,"Some airplanes have cabin air filtration systems equipped with HEPA filters which can remove viruses and germs quickly, minimizing the duration of the exposure to any potential infectious materials produced by a cough or sneeze. The cabin air system is designed to operate most efficiently by delivering approximately 50 percent outside air and 50 percent filtered, recirculated air. The air supply is essentially sterile and particle-free.  However, adequate ventilation is just one of the preventive measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.  Other important measures include maintaining physical distance of at least 1 meter whenever possible, frequent hand hygiene and wearing a mask. Passengers should check with the airline company and the national or local guidelines about when and where to wear a mask while flying."
The travel company is asking me to wear a mask while traveling. Which kind of mask should I use?,"You should follow the advice of your travel company. If the type of mask is not specified then people 60 years and over, and those who have underlying health conditions, should wear a medical mask while traveling. This provides greater protection from others who may have the virus.People who feel healthy and have no symptoms can wear a fabric mask to prevent any virus they may have from spreading to others. Remember that wearing a mask does not provide full protection. You should always combine this with frequent hand cleaning, covering a cough or sneeze with a bent elbow or tissue, and maintaining at least a 1 metre distance from others wherever possible.Find out how to choose and wear a mask here."
So how do I stay safe while exercising in COVID-19?,"Do not exercise if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Stay home and rest, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.If you are able to go for a walk or bicycle ride always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. If you go to a park or public open space to walk, run or exercise always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap, before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. Follow the directions of your local health authority in regards to any restrictions on the number of people with you and/or restrictions on the use of public outdoor play or exercise equipment. If you are not regularly active start slowly and with low intensity activities, like walking and low impact exercises. Start with shorter amounts, like 5-10 minutes, and gradually build up to 30 minutes or more continuously over a few weeks. It is better and safer to be active for short periods more frequently than to try and be active for long periods when you are not used to it. Choose the right activity so that you reduce the risk of injury and that you enjoy the activity. Choose the right intensity according to your health status and fitness level. You should be able to breath comfortably and hold a conversation while you do light- and moderate-intensity physical activity."
How do I stay active in and around the home?,"Try and reduce long periods of time spent sitting, whether for work, studying, watching TV, reading, or using social media or playing games using screens. Reduce sitting for long periods by taking short 3-5 minute breaks every 20-30 minutes.
    Simply stand up and stretch or even better, take a walk around the house, up and down the stairs, or into the garden. By just moving around and stretching you can improve your health and wellbeing. For more ideas and illustrations of healthy stretches
    see here.Set up a regular routine to be active every day, by planning a physical activity or exercise break either by yourself, by joining an online class, or by setting up a time to be active online with your friends or colleagues. Making a specific
    time to be active helps ensure you get your daily physical activity. Put the time in your diary, and it will help remind you. Stick with it, as this will help you build a regular routine, and help you adjust to new ways of working, study and family
    life under COVID-19 restrictionsBe active with your family and friends, connecting with others can help you and your family in the home and elsewhere spend time together and be active. Planning time to be active with your children with
    active games at home, walks in the parks, or cycling can be a way the whole family can relax, be together and be active and healthy whilst at home.   Set yourself and your family Be Active goals, by choosing a specific type of activity, time of day and/or number of minutes you will do every day. Get each family member to choose their own goal which sets a bit of a challenge but is
    realistic with help from family or friends and motivation. Record your progress on a weekly activity chart and, if you think it would help, reward yourself with something you value.http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-technical-guidance/stay-physically-active-during-self-quarantine/_recache?fbclid=IwAR2RQYVYBnmpDCMjBwqmoz0hZxzmit_9yKzXu6ZhjGNywRTEzWOUQefU8V0More physical activity ideas to help you stay activeFor Infants under 1 year of ageSpend regular time doing floor-based play with your baby in a prone position (‘tummy time’) and spread this throughout the day while baby is awake.For Children under 5 years of ageActive play in and around the home – invent games which involve being active and can develop skills in throwing, catching, kicking, as well as developing posture and balance.Active play and games where children get out of breath, such as running around, skipping and jumping.For Children and adolescents aged 5-17 yearsActive games and active play with family.Join in online active games or activity classes, also look for online physical education classes as well as exercise routines suitable for adolescents.Set up playground games indoors such as Jump rope and hop-scotch – make up new games and challenges that involve being active. Learn a new skill – for example try an learn to juggle. Encourage doing some muscle strength training activities such as lifting weights or use improvised weight such as bottles full of water or sand.For Adults Climb up the stairs as much as you can, think of it as an opportunity to be active. Use household chores as a way to be more physical activity. Join in an online exercise class or make up your own routine to music you enjoy that uses the major muscle groups and raises you heart rate. Do some muscle strengthening activities such as lifting weights or improvise using full bottles of water or simply use your own body weight and do sets of press ups, sit ups and squats. Make time for fun, such as dancing to music.Where to get more help and informationFor more ideas use internet search platforms and check out social media for suggestions and access to free resources suitable for children of all ages and adults of all fitness and abilities."
Should I get an immunity certificate before travelling?,"The use of “immunity certificates” for international travel in the context of COVID-19 is not currently supported by scientific evidence and therefore not recommended by WHO.
 More evidence is needed to understand the effectiveness of rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests. For more information, please refer to WHO scientific brief “Immunity passports”
 in the context of COVID-19, which will be updated as new evidence becomes available. Beyond
    the scientific considerations, there are ethical, legal and human rights aspects related to privacy of personal data, medical confidentiality, potential risk of falsification or engagement in risky behaviour, stigma and discrimination."
Could I be screened when I exit or arrive at my destination?,"Whether screening is conducted depends on the country policies and its risk benefit analysis. Exit and entry screening includes measures like temperature checking and checking for signs and symptoms (fever above 38°C, cough).  You may be asked to complete a form informing health authorities about your possible exposure to cases within the last two weeks (contact with patients among health care workers, visits to hospitals, sharing accommodation with a person sick with COVID-19, etc.). Symptomatic travellers and identified contacts will be asked to have a medical examination and be tested for COVID- 19. You should not be charged for these protective measures, including any required isolation and quarantine."
Should I use a digital contact tracing app while traveling?,Digital apps are now available in some countries to identify and inform travellers who may have been in contact with a person confirmed to have COVID-19 or had a positive test for COVID-19. They are effective only if a large proportion of the general population uses the app.  International travellers may have issues of compatibility and data sharing when crossing borders. Those considering an app are advised to review the legal and ethical aspects related to individual privacy and personal data protection.
Should I get a test before departure or upon arrival?,"Laboratory PCR testing (molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2) immediately prior to departure or on arrival may provide information about the status of travellers. However, laboratory results should be interpreted with caution, since a small proportion of false negative and false positive results may occur. If conducted, testing should be accompanied by a comprehensive COVID-19 follow up, for example, by advising departing travellers who have been tested to report any symptoms to local public health authorities. If the testing is conducted on arrival, all travellers should be provided with an emergency phone number in case symptoms develop. A relevant case management protocol should be followed in case of a positive test."
What happens if I have symptoms when arriving at my destination?,"If you have any symptoms or have had contact with people who have COVID-19, you may be asked to get an exam and be tested for COVID-19. Even if you don’t test positive, you should be provided with an emergency phone number to call in case symptoms develop later.  You should not be charged by the country for:examinations to determine your health statusrequired vaccinations or protective equipment on arrival (if these were not published at least 10 days earlier)appropriate isolation or quarantine facilitiesrequired certificates at the point of entry that document measures applied any baggage accompanying you"
What should I do after arriving at my destination?,"Travellers should self-monitor for any symptoms for 14 days after arrival. Report any symptoms and your travel history to local health facilities and follow national protocols. If you are confirmed to have COVID-19, you will be placed in isolation in a health facility or in self-isolation at home, depending on the country’s policies, and asked to provide a list of your contacts in the last 14 days. Your contacts will be placed under quarantine."
What should I do if I get sick while traveling?,"If you become ill during your travel, inform your travel attendant (plane, ship, train, etc.). You may be moved to a seat farther away from others. Ask for information on how to be seen by a health care provider and seek care immediately. Wear a mask continuously while you travel, frequently clean your hands with hand sanitizer, cover a cough or sneeze with a bent elbow or tissue, and maintain at least a 1 metre distance from others wherever possible. You should stop travelling as soon as feasible.If you are told you must quarantine or self-isolate yourself in a specific place, you should be provided with free, appropriate facilities and care, and not be asked to stay longer than 14 days."
How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses similar?,"Firstly, COVID-19 and influenza viruses have a similar disease presentation. That is, they both cause respiratory disease, which presents as a wide range of illness from asymptomatic or mild through to severe disease and death.  Secondly, both viruses are transmitted by contact, droplets and fomites. As a result, the same public health measures, such as hand hygiene and good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue), are important actions all can take to prevent infection."
How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different?,"The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19.   Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-symptomatic transmission –transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms – is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.   The reproductive number – the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual – is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult.   Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low. Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from adults, rather than vice versa.  While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection. Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.  Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care."
What medical interventions are available for COVID-19 and influenza viruses?,"While there are a number of therapeutics currently in clinical trials in China and more than 20 vaccines in development for COVID-19, there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19.  In contrast, antivirals and vaccines available for influenza. While the influenza vaccine is not effective against COVID-19 virus, it is highly recommended to get vaccinated each year to prevent influenza infection."
What is serology?,"‘Serology’ is the study of antibodies in blood serum.  
‘Antibodies’ are part of the body’s immune response to infection. Antibodies that work against SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19 – are usually detectable in the first few weeks after infection. The presence of antibodies indicates that a person was infected with SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of whether the individual had severe or mild disease, or no symptoms.
‘Seroprevalence studies’ are conducted to measure the extent of infection, as measured by antibody levels, in a population under study. With any new virus, including SARS-CoV-2, initial seroprevalence in the population is assumed to be low or non-existent due to the fact that the virus has not circulated before."
What is the difference between molecular testing and serologic testing?,"‘Molecular testing’, including polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) testing, detects genetic material of the virus and so can detect if a person is currently infected with SARS-CoV-2.
‘Serologic testing’ detects antibodies against a virus, measuring the amount of antibodies produced following infection, thereby detecting if a person has previously been infected by SARS-CoV-2. Serologic tests should not be used to diagnose acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, as antibodies develop a few weeks after infection."
What is the purpose of serologic testing?,"When a new disease, like COVID-19 emerges, initial surveillance and testing strategies focus initially on patients with severe disease and the use of molecular testing to measure acute infections, as these are the individuals who seek and require health care. This can often miss the fraction of mild or asymptomatic infections that do not require medical attention, and as such, the full extent of infection is not known early in an outbreak.
Serologic testing helps retrospectively determine the size of an outbreak or extent of infection in a population under study. Seroprevalence studies give a more complete picture of how much of a population has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and will capture unrecognized cases not identified through routine or active surveillance."
Does the presence of antibodies mean that a person is immune?,"There are many studies underway to better understand the antibody response following infection to SARS-CoV-2.  Several studies to date show that most people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop antibodies specific to this virus. However, the levels of these antibodies can vary between those who have severe disease (higher levels of antibodies) and those with milder disease or asymptomatic infection (lower levels of antibodies). Many studies are underway to better understand the levels of antibodies that are needed for protection, and how long these antibodies last."
Can people who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection be re-infected?,"To date, there are some reports of individuals who have been reinfected with SARS-CoV-2.  There are likely to be more examples of reinfection reported and scientists are working to understand the role of the immune response in the first and second infection. WHO is working with scientists to understand each occurrence of reinfection and the antibody response during the first and subsequent infections."
What are the results of seroprevalence studies published to date?,"There are now more than 200 peer-reviewed publications,  pre-prints,  manuscripts and government reports of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies. These studies vary in study design, populations under study, serologic tests used, timing of sample collection, and quality. Overall, the population-based seroprevalence reported across available studies remains low, at below 10%.
Some studies conducted in areas of known high virus transmission and studies of health care workers in areas of known high transmission have reported seroprevalence estimates over 20%.
Available study results indicate that, globally, most people remain susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection."
What is herd immunity?,"‘Herd immunity’, also known as ‘population immunity’, is a concept used for vaccination, in which a population can be protected from a certain virus if a threshold of vaccination is reached.
Herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not by exposing them to it. Read the Director-General’s 12 October media briefing speech for more detail.
Vaccines train our immune systems to develop antibodies, just as might happen when we are exposed to a disease but – crucially – vaccines work without making us sick. Vaccinated people are protected from getting the disease in question. Visit our webpage on COVID-19 and vaccines for more detail.
As more people in a community get vaccinated, fewer people remain vulnerable, and there is less possibility for passing the pathogen on from person to person. Lowering the possibility for a pathogen to circulate in the community protects those who cannot be vaccinated due to other serious health conditions from the disease targeted by the vaccine. This is called ‘herd immunity’.
‘Herd immunity’ exists when a high percentage of the population is vaccinated, making it difficult for infectious diseases to spread, because there are not many people who can be infected. Read our Q&A on vaccines and immunization for more information.
The percentage of people who need to have antibodies in order to achieve herd immunity against a particular disease varies with each disease. For example, herd immunity against measles requires about 95% of a population to be vaccinated. The remaining 5% will be protected by the fact that measles will not spread among those who are vaccinated. For polio, the threshold is about 80%.
Achieving herd immunity with safe and effective vaccines makes diseases rarer and saves lives.
Find out more about the science behind herd immunity by reading our dedicated Q&A or watching or reading this interview with WHO’s Chief Scientist, Dr Soumya Swaminathan."
What is self care?,"WHO’s definition of self care is the ability of individuals, families and communities to promote health, prevent disease, maintain health, and to cope with illness and disability with or without the support of a health worker."
What are self-care interventions?,"Self-care interventions recommended by WHO are evidence-based and can include information about a sexual or reproductive health issue as well as ways in which individuals can obtain drugs, devices, diagnostics and/or digital products fully or partially separate from formal health services that can be used with or without the direct supervision of a health worker. For example, self-injectable contraception, HPV self-sampling kits or HIV self-tests."
Why are self-care interventions important during a pandemic like COVID-19?,"With the major disruptions to the normal functioning of national health systems caused by the need to respond to people who have or are affected by the virus, evidence-based, high-quality self-care interventions can provide an important alternative to the usual health facility- or health worker-based services. Self-care is a valuable part of a well-functioning health system and can be particularly useful when physical distancing measures make it more difficult for people to access their normal health care services and medications.

More information can be found here:"
Do I need to see a health worker for self care actions?,"Self-care interventions provide individuals, families and communities with a way to manage their own health at home. Some self-care actions, such as washing your hands and practicing good respiratory hygiene measures that protect you from COVID-19, do not need you to meet with a health worker. Other self-care interventions, such as obtaining a prescription for hormonal contraception and abortion medications or counselling during pregnancy, will need interaction with a health worker. Such support can be provided in different ways during this pandemic and will depend on the healthcare arrangements in place where you live; for example, some medicines are available over-the-counter without a prescription in a pharmacy, or counseling and important information during pregnancy and when caring for a newborn can be provided over the phone or online."
What self care actions can I take to protect my sexual and reproductive health?,"In 2019, WHO issued a new guideline that brought together 32 existing or new recommendations on a range of sexual and reproductive health self-care interventions. The guideline has recommendations on pregnancy and newborn care, contraception, abortion, sexually transmitted infections including HIV and HPV, and for sexual health more broadly. The full list of recommendations can be found here:"
How can I get healthcare support during the COVID-19 pandemic for a self-care intervention?,"There are a number of ways in which support can be provided:
Digital technologies and platforms, such as helplines through the phone or online or websites of organizations with recognized expertise may be available for consultation or follow up. Such information sources could enable you to then proceed with obtaining and self-administering an injectable contraceptive or self-testing for HIV, for example.

It may also be possible to get over the counter medical devices, medicines, information and diagnostics through pharmacies or drug stores. Menstrual hygiene products, pregnancy tests, condoms and emergency contraception pills are usually available over-the-counter and depending on where you live, contraceptive pills and drugs that protect you from getting HIV if you think you have been exposed to risk.

You may also be able to receive communications in a variety of ways that can help keep you healthy. Examples include notifications and reminders about taking medicines sent by SMS or email."
Is self care safe?,"For all of the recommendations on self-care interventions on sexual and reproductive health issued by WHO, the evidence to date suggests that self care is safe, with the right level of support by the health service as needed.

Self-care can also benefit health workers, by allowing them to serve a greater number of patients and deploying their clinical skills where greatest need exists. During a pandemic such as COVID-19, adopting self-care as part of the healthcare system can also reduce the exposure of health workers to infection as self-care will reduce the number of in-person contacts with a health worker."
Are children at lower risk of COVID-19 than adults?,"So far, data suggests that children under the age of 18 years represent about 8.5% of reported cases, with relatively few deaths compared to other age groups and usually mild disease. However, cases of critical illness have been reported. As with adults, pre-existing medical conditions have been suggested as a risk factor for severe disease and intensive care admission in children.Further studies are underway to assess the risk of infection in children and to better understand transmission in this age group."
What is the role of children in transmission?,"The role of children in transmission is not yet fully understood. To date, few outbreaks involving children or schools have been reported. However, the small number of outbreaks reported among teaching or associated staff to date suggests that spread
    of COVID-19 within educational settings may be limited.As children generally have milder illness and fewer symptoms, cases may sometimes go unnoticed. Importantly, early data from studies suggest that infection rates among teenagers may be higher than in younger children.Considering that many countries are starting to slowly lift restrictions on activities, the longer-term effects of keeping schools open on community transmission are yet to be evaluated. Some modelling studies suggest that school re-opening might have
    a small effect on wider transmission in the community, but this is not well understood. Further studies are underway on the role of children in transmission in and outside of educational settings. WHO is collaborating with scientists around the world
    to develop protocols that countries can use to study COVID-19 transmission in educational institutions. Click here to access this information."
"Should children with underlying health conditions (asthma, diabetes, obesity) return to school?","Whether a child should go to school depends on their health condition, the current transmission of COVID-19 within their community, and the protective measures the school and community have in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. While current evidence suggests that the risk of severe disease for children is lower overall than for adults, special precautions can be taken to minimize the risk of infection among children, and the benefits of returning to school should also be considered.Current evidence suggests that people with underlying conditions such as chronic respiratory illness including asthma (moderate-to-severe), obesity, diabetes or cancer, are at higher risk of developing severe disease and death than people without other health conditions. This also appears to be the case for children, but more information is still needed."
Should teachers and other staff with underlying health conditions return to school?,"Adults 60 years and older and people with underlying health conditions are at higher risk for severe disease and death. The decision to return to a teaching environment depends on the individual and should include consideration of local disease trends, as well as the measures being put in place in schools to prevent further spread."
What is the incubation period for children?,"The incubation period for children is the same as in adults. The time between exposure to COVID-19 and when symptoms start is commonly around 5 to 6 days, and ranges from 1 to 14 days."
What should be considered when deciding whether to re-open schools or keep them open?,"Deciding to close, partially close or reopen schools should be guided by a risk-based approach, to maximize the educational, well-being and health benefit for students, teachers, staff, and the wider community, and help prevent a new outbreak of COVID-19 in the community.Several elements should be assessed in deciding to re-open schools or keep them open:The epidemiology of COVID-19 at the local level: This may vary from one place to another within a countryBenefits and risks: what are the likely benefits and risks to children and staff of open schools? Including consideration of:Transmission intensity in the area where the school operates: No cases, sporadic transmission; clusters transmission or community transmissionOverall impact of school closures on education, general health and wellbeing; and on vulnerable and marginalized populations (e.g. girls, displaced or disabled)Effectiveness of remote learning strategiesDetection and response: Are the local health authorities able to act quickly?The capacity of schools/educational institutions to operate safelyCollaboration and coordination: Is the school collaborating with local public health authorities?The range of other public health measures being implemented outside school"
What benefits would school re-opening provide?,"School closures have clear negative impacts on child health, education and development, family income and the overall economy.The decision to reopen schools should include consideration of the following benefits:Allowing students to complete their studies and continue to the next levelEssential services, access to nutrition, child welfare, such as preventing violence against childrenSocial and psychological well-beingAccess to reliable information on how to keep themselves and others safeReducing the risk of non-return to schoolBenefit to society, such as allowing parents to work"
Who is self care for?,"Self care can be practiced by everyone and evidence-based self-care interventions have the potential to benefit even the most vulnerable populations. For individuals who may need to access information, counselling or a health services before, during or after accessing a self-care intervention, links with existing health services remains important. Examples of providing access to referrals and health facilities for non-COVID-19 related SRH conditions may include ensuring antenatal care visits, delivery and postpartum care; retesting and HIV treatment if an individual’s HIV self-test is positive along with other STI diagnostic and treatment as required. In addition, crisis centers, shelters, legal aid, and protection services for individuals subject to violence."
Where can I get more information?,"Further information about self-care can be found on the WHO website:4

What are the prevention and control measures to be prepared and put in place in schools?,"There are several actions and requirements that should be reviewed and put in place to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in schools and into the community; and to ensure the safety of children and school staff while at school. Special provisions should be considered for early childhood development, higher learning institutions, residential schools or specialized institutions.WHO recommends the following:Community-level measures: Carry out early detection, testing, contact tracing and quarantine of contacts; investigate clusters; ensure physical distancing, hand and hygiene practices and age-appropriate mask use; shield vulnerable groups. Community-led initiatives such as addressing misleading rumors also play an important role in reducing the risk of infection.Policy, practice and infrastructure: Ensure the necessary resources, policies and infrastructure, are in place that protect the health and safety of all school personnel, including people at higher risk.Behavioral aspects: Consider the age and capacity of students to understand and respect measures put in place. Younger children may find it more difficult to adhere to physical distancing or the appropriate use of masks.Safety and security: School closure or re-opening may affect the safety and security of students and the most vulnerable children may require special attention, such as during pick-up and drop-off.Hygiene and daily practices at the school and classroom level: Physical distancing of at least 1 metre between individuals including spacing of desks, frequent hand and respiratory hygiene, age-appropriate mask use, ventilation and environmental cleaning measures should be in place to limit exposure. Schools should educate staff and students on COVID-19 prevention measures, develop a schedule for daily cleaning and disinfection of the school environment, facilities and frequently touches surfaces, and ensure availability of hand hygiene facilities and national/local guidance on the use of masks.Screening and care of sick students, teachers and other school staff: Schools should enforce the policy of “staying home if unwell”, waive the requirement for a doctor’s note, create a checklist for parents/students/staff to decide whether to go to school (taking into consideration the local situation), ensure students who have been in contact with a COVID-19 case stay home for 14 days, and consider options for screening on arrival.Protection of individuals at high-risk: Schools should identify students and teachers at high-risk with pre-existing medical conditions to come up with strategies to keep them safe; maintain physical distancing and se of medical masks as well as frequent hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.Communication with parents and students: Schools should keep students and parents informed about the measures being implemented to ensure their collaboration and support.Additional school-related measures such as immunization checks and catch-up vaccination programmes: Ensure continuity or expansion of essential services, including school feeding and mental health and psycho-social support.Physical distancing outside classrooms: Maintain a distance of at least 1 metre for both students (all age groups) and staff, where feasible.Physical distancing inside classrooms:In areas with community transmission of COVID-19, maintain a distance of at least 1 metre between all individuals of all age groups, for any schools remaining open. This includes increasing desk spacing and staging recesses, breaks and lunchbreaks; limiting the mixing of classes and of age groups; considering smaller classes or alternating attendance schedules, and ensuring good ventilation in classrooms.In areas with cluster-transmission of COVID-19, a risk-based approach should be taken when deciding whether to keep a distance of at least 1 metre between students. Staff should always keep at least 1 metre apart from each other and from students and should wear a mask in situations where 1-metre distance is not practical.In areas with sporadic cases/no cases of COVID-19, children under the age of 12 should not be required to keep physical distance at all times. Where feasible, children aged 12 and over should keep at least 1 metre apart from each other.  Staff should always keep at least 1 metre from each other and from students and should wear a mask in situations where 1-metre distance is not practical.  Remote learning: Where children cannot attend classes in person, support should be given to ensure students have continued access to educational materials and technologies (internet, texting radio, radio, or television), (e.g. delivering assignments or broadcasting lessons). Shutting down educational facilities   should only be considered when no alternatives are available."
Checklist for parents/caregivers and community members,"Monitor your child’s health and keep them home from school if they are ill.Teach and model good hygiene practices for your children:Wash your hands with soap and safe water frequently. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water, if hands are visibly dirty.Ensure that safe drinking water is available and toilets or latrines are clean and available at home.Ensure waste is safely collected, stored and disposed of.Cough and sneeze into a tissue or your elbow and avoid touching your face, eyes, mouth and nose.Encourage your children to ask questions and express their feelings with you and their teachers. Remember that your child may have different reactions to stress; be patient and understanding. Prevent stigma by using facts and reminding students to be considerate of one another.Coordinate with the school to receive information and ask how you can support school safety efforts (though parent-teacher committees, etc),."
Checklist for students and children,"In a situation like this it is normal to feel sad, worried, confused, scared or angry. Know that you are not alone and talk to someone you trust, like your parent or teacher so that you can help keep yourself and your school safe and healthy.Ask questions, educate yourself and get information from reliable sources.Protect yourself and others:Wash your hands frequently, always with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.Remember to not touch your face, eyes, nose and mouth.Do not share cups, eating utensils, food or drinks with others.Be a leader in keeping yourself, your school, family and community healthy.  Share what you learn about preventing disease with your family and friends, especially with younger children Model good practices such as sneezing or coughing into your elbow and washing your hands, especially for younger family members.Don’t stigmatize your peers or tease anyone about being sick; remember that the virus doesn’t follow geographical boundaries, ethnicities, age or ability or gender. Tell your parents, another family member, or a caregiver if you feel sick, and ask to stay home."
What are the risks during transportation to and from schools?,"The following adaptations to transport to and from school should be implemented to limit unnecessary exposure of school or staff members.Promote and put in place respiratory and hand hygiene, physical distancing measures and use of masks in transportation such as school buses, in accordance with local policy.Provide tips for how to safely commute to and from school, including for public transportation.Organize only one child per seat and ensure physical distancing of at least 1 metre between passengers in school buses, if possible. This may require more school buses per school.If possible and safe, keep the windows of the buses, vans, and other vehicles open."
"Does WHO recommend staff and children to wear masks at school? And if yes, what type of masks?","In countries or areas where there is intense community transmission of COVID-19 and in settings where physical distancing cannot be achieved, the following criteria for use of masks in schools are recommended:1. Children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks.2. For children between six and 11 years of age, a risk-based approach should be applied to the decision to use a mask, considering:intensity of transmission in the area where the child is and evidence on the risk of infection and transmission in this age group.beliefs, customs and behaviours.the child’s capacity to comply with the correct use of masks and availability of adult supervision.potential impact of mask wearing on learning and development.additional considerations such as sport activities or for children with disabilities or underlying diseases.3. Children and adolescents 12 years or older should follow the national mask guidelines for adults.4. Teacher and support staff may be required to wear masks when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others or there is widespread transmission in the area.Types of mask:Fabric masks are recommended to prevent onward transmission in the general population in public areas, particularly where distancing is not possible, and in areas of community transmission. This could include the school grounds in some situations.
    Masks may help to protect others, because wearers may be infected before symptoms of illness appear. The policy on wearing a mask or face covering should be in line with national or local guidelines. Where
    used, masks should be worn, cared for and disposed of properly. The use of masks by children and adolescents in schools should only be considered as one part of a strategy to limit the spread of COVID-19."
Are there any specific recommendations on school ventilation and air conditioning use?,"Yes, ensure adequate ventilation and increase total airflow supply to occupied spaces, if possible. Clean, natural ventilation (i.e., opening windows) should be used inside buildings where possible, without re-circulating the air. If heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems are used they should be regularly inspected, maintained and cleaned. Rigorous standards for installation, maintenance and filtration are essential to make sure they are effective and safe. Consider running the systems at maximum outside airflow for two hours before and after times when the building is occupied, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations."
What should be monitored after re-opening of school?,"The following should be monitored:effectiveness of symptoms-reporting, monitoring, rapid testing and tracing of suspected casesthe effects of policies and measures on educational objectives and learning outcomesthe effects of policies and measures on health and well-being of children, siblings, staff, parents and other family membersthe trend in school dropouts after lifting the restrictionsthe number of cases in children and staff in the school, and frequency of school-based outbreaks in the local administrative area and the country.Assessment of impact of remote teaching on learning outcomes.Based on what is learned from this monitoring, further modifications should be made to continue to provide children and staff with the safest environment possible."
What is COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new coronavirus, which has not been previously identified in humans. In most cases, COVID-19 causes mild symptoms including dry cough, tiredness and fever, though fever may not be a symptom for some older people. Other mild symptoms include aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who get COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing."
How is COVID-19 transmitted?,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets."
Who is at risk of developing severe disease?,"Older people, and people of all ages with pre-existing medical conditions (such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, or cancer) appear to develop serious illness more often than others."
"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?","While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of mild COVID-19, there are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials of both western and traditional medicines. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19 and will continue to provide updated information as soon as research results become available."
What can I do to prevent infection?,"To prevent infection, there are a five things that you can do.
 
1. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water and dry them thoroughly. 
You can also use alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty and if this product is available. Cleaning your hands frequently will remove the virus if it is on your hands. You can learn how to wash your hands in this video (or this visual). If an alcohol-based hand rub or soap is not available, then using chlorinated water (0.05%) for handwashing is an option, but it is not ideal because frequent use may irritate your skin.
 
 2. Cover your mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when coughing and sneezing. 
And remember to throw away the used tissue immediately in a bin with a lid and to wash your hands. This way you protect others from any virus released through coughs and sneezes.
 
3. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. 
Hands touch many surfaces which can be contaminated with the virus. If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself.
 
4. Keep physical distance from others. 
If your national or local authorities have put in place confinement measures, it is important to respect them. Taking exercise outside is good for your physical and mental health, but should only be undertaken if regulations for your area allow it. When you do go out, avoid crowded spaces and maintain at least 1 metre distance (3 feet or arms-length) from others. Avoid unnecessary visits to your house. If visits are necessary (e.g. caregiver to support with activities of daily living), ask your visitor to regularly check for symptoms to ensure that they are symptom free when visiting you. Ask them to also follow these five key actions, including washing their hands when they first enter your home. 
 
5. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces every day. 
This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, taps, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. Learn more by clicking here."
What can older people do to prepare for COVID-19 in their community?,"There is a lot that you can do to prepare for COVID-19 in your community. Inform yourself of the special measures taken in your community as well as the services and the sources of reliable information that are availableduring the health emergency  (e.g. home deliveries, psychosocial support, health ministry website, alternative access to your pension). Create a list of the basic supplies that you will need for at least two weeks and try to get these delivered where possible (e.g. non-perishable food items, household products, batteries for assistive
            devices you may use, and prescription medicines). Alternatively, ask family members, caregivers, neighbours or community leaders to help with ordering and/or delivery of groceries or prescription medicines. Make sure that your mobile phone
            credit is topped up and identify a safe place to charge your phone regularly so that you can keep in contact with family and friends and reach emergency services if needed.   Make a list of emergency numbers (e.g. COVID-19 local helpline, nearby hospital and health emergencies numbers, hotline for victims of abuse, psychosocial support hotline) and support contacts (e.g. family members
            and friends, main caregiver, community care worker, associations of older persons). If you live alone, you may wish to share this list and ask your neighbours, family or caregiver to be in touch regularly, for example, by phone or video chat. Discuss with your health-care worker how your health needs can be addressed during COVID-19. This may involve postponing non-urgent appointments, talking to your doctor or health-care worker by phone or video chat instead
            of in person and/or revising your vaccination schedule. If you rely on the support provided by a caregiver, identify with him or her another person that you trust to support your daily living and care needs in case your caregiver is unable to continue to provide
            care. Together, you can note down all the personal care and assistance that you require and how it should be provided and share it with this trusted person so that they can be ready to provide care in case of need.  If you are the primary caregiver of another person who is care dependent (e.g. grandchild, older spouse, child with a disability), identify a person that you and the person that you care for trust to take on your caregiving responsibilities in case you fall sick.
 Local authorities or volunteer organizations that provide support in these situations in your community might be able to help. If multiple people live in your home, if possible prepare a separate room or space in your home so that anyone showing symptoms compatible with COVID-19 can be isolated from others. If you do not have space for self-isolation,
            contact your community leaders or local health authorities to see if there is community space that could help you or other household members self-isolate. Think about what matters most to you regarding care and support, including medical treatment, in case something happens to you and you are unable to make your own decisions. If you want to develop an advanced care plan to record
            your treatment and care wishes, you can talk about it with your health-care worker or someone that you trust. You can write down your wishes and  share them with people you trust."
How can I keep healthy on a daily basis during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"You can follow these 10 steps to keep healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic.Keep to your regular routines as much as possible and maintain a daily schedule for yourself including sleeping, meals and activities.  Stay socially connected. Speak to loved ones and people you trust every day or as much as possible, using the telephone, video-calls or messaging, through writing letters, etc. Use this time to share your feelings and to do common
        hobbies together.
         
Be physically active every day. Reduce long periods of sitting and set up a daily routine that includes at least 30 minutes of exercise. Make sure to do activities that are safe and appropriate for your level of physical fitness as
        indicated by your health-care worker. You can use household chores as a way to keep physically active, follow an on-line class (e.g. Tai Chi, yoga) or choose your favourite music and dance to that. 
 Drink water and eat healthy and well-balanced meals. This will keep you hydrated, help strengthen your immune system and lower the risk of chronic illnesses and infectious diseases.  For nutrition advice click here.
  Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol. Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 because smoking can affect lung capacity and because the act of smoking increases the possibility of transmission of virus from hand
        to mouth. Drinking alcohol not only disturbs your sleep but may also increase your risk of falls, weaken your immune system, and interact with any prescription medicines that you are taking. Limit the amount of alcohol you drink or don’t
        drink alcohol at all.
         Take breaks from news coverage about COVID-19 as prolonged exposure can cause feelings of anxiety and despair. Seek updates at specific times of the day from a reliable source like the 
        WHO website (click here) or national or local channels in order to help you distinguish facts from rumours or scams.  Engage in hobbies and activities that you enjoy or learn something new. Cognitive exercise such as reading a book or doing crosswords/Sudoku will keep your mind active and distract you from worrying. You can also use this time to
        keep a well-being diary (click here for an example.)
 If you have ongoing health conditions, take your prescribed medicines and follow the advice of your health-care worker regarding any health visits or phone consultations.
         If you have an emergency medical condition that is not related to COVID-19, contact health emergencies immediately and ask what you should do next. Follow the instructions of the health-care worker. 
 If stress, worry, fear or sadness get in the way of your daily activities for several days in a row, seek psychosocial support from available services in your community.  If you are subject to abuse or violence from
        others, tell someone you trust and report this to the relevant authorities. You can also seek support from dedicated helplines that may be available in your country."
What should I do if I have symptoms of COVID-19?,"If you present symptoms related to COVID-19, seek medical advice. Call by phone first if possible and give information about pre-existing health conditions and medicines that you are taking. Follow the instructions of the health-care worker and monitor your symptoms regularly.  If you have difficulty breathing, contact health emergencies immediately as this may be due to a respiratory infection. Call by phone first if possible to learn what to do next. If you live with others, make sure that you isolate yourself as soon as you suspect infectionby using the space that you identified in advance. You and other members of the household should also wear a medical mask as much as possible if these are available. You can learn how to wear a mask here. If you live with others and home care for COVID-19 is advised by your health-care worker, other household members should follow available guidance on home care for patients with COVID-19 presenting with mild symptoms and management of their contacts (guidance here). See related flyers for people who are ill, for household members and for caregivers.  If you live alone and home care for COVID-10 is advised by your health-care worker, ask your family, friends, neighbours, health-care worker or a local volunteer organisation to check in on you regularly and to provide support as needed following existing guidance for caregivers (guidance here)."
I have recently lost someone I care about. What advice do you have to help me cope?,"Losing someone close to you is always hard, whatever the cause. During these extraordinary circumstances, when your usual routine may be disrupted and when funerals may not be permitted, it may be even harder. Following this advice may help. Do not criticise yourself for how you feel. When you lose a family member or friend to COVID-19, you may experience a range of emotions.  You may also have difficulty sleeping or low levels of energy. All these feelings are normal
        and there is no right or wrong way to feel grief. Allow yourself time to process your emotions in response to your loss. You may think that the sadness and pain that you feel will never go away, but in most cases, these feelings lessen over time. Talk regularly with people that you trust about your feelings. Keep to your routines as much as you feel able and try to focus on activities that bring you joy. Seek advice and comfort from people that you trust (e.g. religious/faith leaders, mental health workers or other trusted members of your community) while maintaining physical distance (e.g. attending virtual mass).    Think of alternative ways to say goodbye to the person who passed away such as writing a letter or dedicating a drawing to your loved one. These are small actions that can help you cope with grief and loss, particularly in situations where funeral services are not permitted"
What precautions are necessary when visiting someone in a health and/or long-term care facility?,"If you have been in contact with someone suspected or confirmed with COVID-19, or are feeling unwell, do not visit any health or long-term care facility.Follow the facility guidelines on any visit requirements, including screening and wearing a mask.Clean your hands before entering and try to keep at least a 1 metre distance from others.If you are 60 or over, or have a chronic condition like heart disease, take extra precautions by wearing a medical mask during your visit."
"I am ATTENDING a small gathering or an event such as a wedding, a party or sports tournament. What precautions should I take to protect myself and others from getting infected with COVID-19?","Always check local regulations before attending an event.Stay at home if you are feeling unwell.Always comply with the following 3 basic preventive measures:Maintain at least 1 metre distance from others, and wear a mask if you cannot guarantee this distance.Cover a sneeze or cough with a tissue or bent elbow, and immediately dispose of tissue in a closed-lid bin. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, or with a hand sanitizer."
"I am ORGANIZING a small gathering or an event such as a wedding, a party or sports tournament. What precautions should I take to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among guests?","Always check local guidelines before planning your event.Brief guests about precautions before the event starts; during the event, remind guests of these precautions and ensure they are followed.Choose outdoor venues over indoor spaces – if indoors, ensure the area is well-ventilated.Minimize crowding by staggering arrivals and departures, numbering entries, designating seats/places and marking the floor to ensure physical distancing between people of at least one meter.Provide all necessary supplies – hand hygiene stations, hand sanitizer or soap and water, tissues, closed-lid bins, distance markers, masks."
Are pregnant women at higher risk from COVID-19?,"Pregnant women or recently pregnant women who are  older, overweight, and have pre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes seem to have an increased  risk of developing severe COVID-19. When pregnant women develop severe disease, they also seem to more often require care in intensive care units than non-pregnant women of reproductive age.Due to changes in their bodies and immune systems, we know that pregnant women can be badly affected by some respiratory infections. It is therefore important that they take precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, and report possible symptoms (including fever, cough or difficulty in breathing) to their healthcare provider.WHO will continue to review and update its information and advice as more evidence becomes available."
I’m pregnant. How can I protect myself against COVID-19?,"Pregnant women should take the same precautions to avoid COVID-19 infection as other people. You can help protect yourself by:Washing your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.Keeping space between yourself and others and avoiding crowded spaces. Wear a non-medical, fabric  mask where it is not possible to keep sufficient physical distance between yourself and others.Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth.Practicing respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.If you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Call before going to a health facility, and follow the directions of your local health authority.Pregnant women and women who have recently delivered should attend their routine care appointments, according to local policies and following adapted measures to reduce possible transmission of the virus."
Should pregnant women be tested for COVID-19?,"Testing protocols and eligibility during pregnancy vary depending on where you live.However, WHO recommendations are that pregnant women with symptoms of COVID-19 should be prioritized for testing. If they have COVID-19, they may need specialized care."
Can COVID-19 be passed from a woman to her unborn or newborn baby?,"We still do not know if a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can pass the virus to her fetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery. To date, the active virus has not been found in samples of fluid around the baby in the womb or breastmilk."
What care should be available during pregnancy and childbirth?,"All pregnant women and their newborns, including those with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections, have the right to high quality care before, during and after childbirth, including mental health care.A safe and positive childbirth experience includes:Being treated with respect and dignity;Having a companion of choice present during delivery;Clear communication by maternity staff;Appropriate pain relief strategies:Mobility in labour where possible, and birth position of choice.If COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed, health workers should take all appropriate precautions to reduce risks of infection to themselves and others, including hand hygiene, and appropriate use of protective clothing like gloves, gown and medical mask."
Do pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 need to give birth by caesarean section?,No. WHO advice is that caesarean sections should only be performed when medically justified.The mode of birth should be individualized and based on a woman’s preferences alongside obstetric indications.
Can I touch and hold my newborn baby if I have COVID-19?,"Yes. Close contact and early, exclusive breastfeeding helps a baby to thrive. You should be supported toBreastfeed safely, with good respiratory hygiene; Hold your newborn skin-to-skin, andShare a room with your babyYou should wash your hands before and after touching your baby, and keep all surfaces clean. Mothers with symptoms of COVID-19 are advised to wear a medical mask, during any contact with the baby."
What does it mean to say a virus mutates or changes?,"When a virus replicates or makes copies of itself, it sometimes changes a little bit. These changes are called “mutations”. The virus with the new mutation(s) is called a “variant” of the original virus.Some viruses change fast and others more slowly. SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, changes more slowly than others viruses such as HIV or influenza viruses. This is in part due to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has an internal “proofreading mechanism” which corrects mistakes when it makes copies of itself.Most changes have little to no impact on the virus’ properties. Occasionally, they result in a virus variant that is better adapted to its environment compared to the original virus. In that case, it can become dominant in a specific environment. This process of selection of successful variants is called “viral evolution” and this is a natural process all viruses go through."
Should I be concerned about SARS-CoV-2 changing?,"It is normal for viruses to change. Most changes have little to no impact on the virus’ properties. However, depending on where the changes are located in the virus genetic material, and how these changes affect the virus’ shape or properties, some could potentially impact how it behaves and spreads.If a virus changes so much that it is different from the one that vaccines are designed to combat, or tests to recognize, it may influence how well vaccines and diagnostic tests work. WHO, along with its network of experts, is monitoring changes to the virus so that if such a situation arises, measures can be taken to prevent the spread of that variant.So far, the SARS-CoV-2 has changed very little having no impact on available diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines that are in development."
What is WHO doing to monitor and understand the changes in SARS-CoV-2?,"Since the start of the outbreak, WHO has been working with a global network of expert laboratories around the world to support testing and better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.Research groups from all over the world have sequenced SARS-CoV-2 and shared these on public databases, including GISAID. This global collaboration allows scientists to better track the virus and how it is changing.Within WHO’s global laboratory network, we have established a dedicated SARS-CoV-2 Evolution Working Group, which is working to detect new mutations early and assess their possible impact on the virus itself and on diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines."
"How does SARS-CoV-2 change when it infects animals, and what are the implications?","SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily through human-to-human transmission, but there is evidence of transmission between humans and animals. Several animals like mink, dogs, domestic cats, lions, tigers and raccoon dogs have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after contact with infected humans.There have been reports of large outbreaks in mink farms in several countries. SARS-CoV-2 can acquire unique changes while infecting minks. It has been observed that these mink variants are able to jump back into humans. Preliminary results suggest that the mink variants infecting humans appear to have the same properties as other variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Further research is needed to better understand whether these mink variants will be able to provide sustained transmission among humans and could have a negative impact on countermeasures, such as vaccines.WHO works closely with other organizations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the World Organisation for Animal Health, to evaluate these situations occurring at the animal-human interface."
How large does a meeting or event need to be in order to be a “mass gathering”?,"High profile international sporting events such as the Olympics or World Cups as well as international religious events such as the Hajj count as mass gatherings. However, lower profile conferences and events can also meet WHO’s definition of a mass gathering. An event counts as a “mass gatherings” if the number of people it brings together is so large that it has the potential to strain the planning and response resources of the health system in the community where it takes place. You need to consider the location and duration of the event as well as the number of participants. For example, if the event takes place over several days in a small island state where the capacity of the health system is quite limited then even an event with just a few thousand participants could place a big strain on the health system and then be considered a “mass gathering” event. Conversely, if the event is held in a big city in a country with a large, well-resourced health system and lasts just a few hours, the event may not constitute a “mass gathering” event."
Does WHO recommend that all international mass gatherings be cancelled because of COVID-19?,"No. As each international mass gathering is different, the factors to consider when determining if the event should be cancelled may also differ. Any decision to change a planned international gathering should be based on a careful assessment of the risks and how they can be managed, and the level of event planning. The assessment should involve all stakeholders in the event, and in particular the health authorities in the country or community where the event is due to take place. These authorities and stakeholders are in the best position to assess the level of stress the event might place on the local health system and emergency services – and whether this level of stress is acceptable in the current situation. It is WHO’s view that all countries with community transmission should seriously consider postponing or reducing mass gatherings that bring people together and have the potential to amplify disease and support the recommended best practice of physical distancing. Any decision will be supported through the use of WHO tools, in particular the Risk Assessment for Mass Gatherings during COVID-19. If movement restrictions and further national measures have been established in the country, the WHO RA does not apply. However, when the process of re-opening/conducting mass gatherings is being considered post movement restrictions, it will be key to ensure any decisions are based on a risk assessment, such as the WHO Mass gatherings COVID-19 risk assessment."
What factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not?,"For countries not currently known to be experiencing community transmission of COVID-19, the priority consideration will be whether the planned mass gathering event substantially increases the risk of the virus entering the country and becoming established, as well as the risk for participants to importing infection back to their home country and further increasing global spread. In making this assessment, the organizers and their national or local health authorities should recognize that the risk of imported cases of COVID-19 is naturally linked to international travel. They should also recognize that it is neither realistic or desirable to aim for zero risk. When organizers and health authorities are determining whether to hold a mass gathering, they should determine what is an acceptable risk and what additional measures should be implemented to mitigate the risks.For countries where COVID-19 has already started to spread in the community, key consideration will be: aiming at containing or at least slowing down the spread of the virus in the local community/country.preventing participants from other countries being infected with COVID-19  In each case the risk should be considered in the context of the known features of COVID-19, its severity, its transmissibility and the effectiveness of measures to prevent or reduce transmission. The strain already placed on the local health system in responding to COVID-19 outbreak(s), and the additional strain the mass gathering might place on the system also need to be taken into account.You can find more advice on what to look at in the WHO document Key planning recommendations for Mass Gatherings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak of 14 February 2020. See: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/key-planning-recommendations-for-mass-gatherings-in-the-context-of-the-current-covid-19-outbreak"
What if my organization does not have the expertise to assess the risks COVID-19 poses for our planned mass gathering?,The national and local public health authorities in the country where you plan to hold the mass gathering will most likely know how to conduct a health risk assessment. If there is a WHO Country Office there they may also be able to provide some expert support. So too might the WHO Regional Office in your part of the world. You can find the names and contact details of the WHO Regional Offices at https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/regional-offices
"If we go ahead with an international mass gathering, what can we do to reduce the risk of participants catching COVID-19?","Promote hand washing, respiratory hygiene and social distancing at the event. Make sure you have emergency contact details for all participants, including where they are staying during the event. You should make it clear to them that this information will be shared with the local public health authorities to enable rapid contact tracing if a participant at the event becomes ill with COVID-19. The event organisers need to have an agreed preparedness plan in case one or more participants become ill with COVID-19 symptoms. This should include rapid isolation of the ill person and their safe transfer to a local health facility. You should consider whether the number of participants at the event could be reduced, making available participation by video or teleconference and possibly screening participants for COVID-19 symptoms (cough, fever, malaise) at points of entry to the venue. You can find advice on how individual participants can protect themselves and their loved ones from COVID-19 at: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"
Where can I find more advice on assessing and managing health risks around international mass gatherings?,"WHO has produced guidance and also a training course on how to plan for a mass gathering. The guidance and the course both look at how to conduct a risk assessment, plan for and manage health risks in partnership with the local authorities: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/points-of-entry-and-mass-gatherings  You can find advice to give individual participants on how to protect themselves and their loved ones from COVID-19 at: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"
What should be the criteria for excluding an athlete or other accredited participant from competing?,"Agreed health criteria are needed for the exclusion of athletes from competing and for allowing them to return to competition wherever appropriate. These should be consistent with public health guidelines for the general population, with risk profiles based on recent travel to high-risk community transmission zones, recent contact with individuals diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19, current symptomatology, etc. Athletes who are feeling unwell should not participate in events.If testing of athletes has been agreed with the local public health service there is a need to consider test availability, time taken for receipt of test results and host-country health services capacity. Criteria for exclusion of officials/judges from competition and for allowing them to return to competition where appropriate should follow guidance and criteria for the workplace.Requirements for the attendance of all athletes and other accredited participants should be put in place:–   health check: travel declaration and temperature screening–   contact tracing protocols ready (with all details of those present) –   allowing extra spacing (physical distancing)–   following all hygiene precautions.  Isolation procedures for athletes and other accredited participants (e.g. field-of-play staff, medical teams, officials who have close contact with the athletes) who feel unwell or become symptomatic should be clear and documented and rehearsed prior to holding the event, especially for higher risk sports, e.g. contact sports."
Why should people wear masks?,"Masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives. Masks reduce potential exposure risk from an infected person whether they have symptoms or not. People wearing masks are protected from getting infected. Masks also prevent onward transmission when worn by a person who is infected.
Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive ‘Do it all!’ approach including: physical distancing, avoiding crowded, closed and close-contact settings, improving ventilation, cleaning hands, covering sneezes and coughs, and more. 
Find out more on our main public advice page"
Who should wear what kind of mask?,"Medical masks are recommended for the following groups:

All health workers in clinical settings. See our guidance for more information on the use of personal protective equipment by health care workers.
Anyone who is feeling unwell, including people with mild symptoms, such as muscle aches, slight cough, sore throat or fatigue. 
People caring for suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside of health facilities.

When they cannot guarantee a distance of at least 1 metre from others, medical masks are also recommended for the following groups, as they are at a higher risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19 and dying:

People aged 60 or over.
People of any age with underlying health conditions, including: chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, immunocompromised patients and diabetes mellitus. 

Non-medical, fabric masks are advised for use by the general public when physical distancing cannot be maintained, as part of a comprehensive ‘Do it all!’ approach, including improving ventilation; cleaning hands; covering sneezes and coughs, and more.
Find out more on our main public advice page.

Watch our animation on medical and fabric masks, explaining who wears what, when and where."
Should event organizers arrange screening at venues beyond national government requirements for point of entry (PoE)?,"Temperature screening alone, at exit or entry, is not an effective way to stop international spread, since infected individuals may be in incubation period, may not express apparent symptoms early on in the course of the disease, or may dissimulate fever through the use of antipyretics; in addition, such measures require substantial investments for what may bear little benefits. It is more effective to provide prevention recommendation messages to travellers and to collect health declarations at arrival, with travellers’ contact details, to allow for a proper risk assessment and a possible contact tracing of incoming travellers. Event organizers should also consider the capacity to undertake this and the management of suspected cases. However, sporting organizations may have criteria for participation that are stricter than government requirements for Ports of Entry into the country that are based on event risk assessment, including organizers' healthcare capacity.Any additional screening questionnaires for participation in events need to be aligned with public health agencies in the jurisdiction. There is a need to consider how to manage different groups – athletes, officials and spectators, and the large numbers of individuals likely to arrive at a sporting event from many oversea countries – and to follow both host country and WHO travel advice and to assess whether there is difficulty in obtaining accurate information about the travel history of those individuals."
Should event organizers provide COVID-19 testing?,"No, testing should be conducted in accordance with local health providers and national guidance.  Anyone unwell or symptomatic should not be allowed to participate in the event. Establish close collaboration with local public health authorities well before the event, to facilitate testing for athletes, officials or spectators who meet pre-agreed suspect cases definitions. Consider host-country health service capacity to manage any COVID-19 activity, and other public health issues happening at the event over and above its own national pandemic response."
Are there additional safeguards event organizers can implement or recommend to athletes/officials/visitors in the context of COVID-19?,"Follow standard preventative advice to the general public, including physical distancing, in the athletes’ village.Also promote:signage, digital messaging to all participants and their entourages about COVID-19 and how to prevent infectionregular disinfection and cleaning of surfaces, in venues and in personal spaces non-sharing of equipment and cleaning of equipment after each user.Organizers are recommended to develop a checklist (include hand gels stations, hygiene facilities, etc.). See the event mitigation recommendations checklist for event organizers above."
What are the risks arising from public transport to the venue(s)?,The extra risk from participants and spectators travelling on public transport in a major city may not be significant compared to the ongoing risk to the local population using the transport all the time if physical distancing is not possible on public transport.
When should masks be worn by the general public?,"Within wider environments where the virus is spreading, masks should be worn by the general public in settings where it is not possible to maintain at least 1 meter from others. Examples of these settings include indoor locations that are crowded and have poor ventilation, public transport and places of high population density – among others.
In enclosed settings, especially where there is poor ventilation, it is also very important to increase the rate of air change, reduce recirculation of air and increase the use of outdoor air. WHO has published Q&As on ventilation and air conditioning for both the general public and people who manage public spaces and buildings."
How should I wear and clean a fabric mask?,"How to put on and wear a fabric mask:

Before touching the mask, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. 
Inspect the mask for tears or holes, do not use a mask that is damaged. 
Adjust the mask to cover your mouth, nose, and chin, leaving no gaps on the sides. Place the straps behind the head or ears.
Avoid touching the mask while wearing it. If you accidentally touch it, clean your hands. 
Change your mask if it gets dirty or wet.

How to take off and store a fabric mask: 

Clean your hands before taking off the mask.
Take off the mask by removing it from the ear loops, without touching the front of the mask.
If your fabric mask is not dirty or wet and you plan to reuse it, put it in a clean plastic, resealable bag. If you need to use it again, hold the mask at the elastic loops when removing it from the bag. Clean your mask once a day.
Clean your hands after removing the mask. 

How to clean a fabric mask:

Wash fabric masks in soap or detergent and preferably hot water (at least 60 degrees Centigrade/140 degrees Fahrenheit) at least once a day.
If it is not possible to wash the masks in hot water, then: 

Wash the mask in soap/detergent and room temperature water, followed by either boiling the mask for 1 minute, OR; 
Soak the mask in 0.1% chlorine for 1 minute and thoroughly rinsing the mask with room temperature water (there should not be any toxic residue of chlorine on the mask).


General tips:

Make sure you have your own masks and do not share it with others.
Resist the temptation to pull down your mask or take if off when speaking to other people.
Do not store your mask around your arm or wrist or pull it down to rest around your chin or neck. Instead store it in a clean plastic bag. 

Watch our ‘How to wear a fabric mask’ video for a demonstration."
"How should I put on, wear and take off a medical mask?","How to put on and take off a medical mask:

Before touching the mask, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.  
Inspect the mask for tears or holes; do not use a mask that has previously been worn or is damaged. 
Verify which side is the top – this is usually where the metal strip is. 
Then, identify the inside of the mask, which is usually the white side. 
Place the mask on your face covering your nose, mouth and chin, making sure that there are no gaps between your face and the mask. Place the straps behind the head or ears.
Pinch the metal strip so it moulds to the shape of your nose.
Remember, do not touch the front of the mask while using it to avoid contamination; if you accidentally touch it, clean your hands.  

How to take off a medical mask:

Before touching the mask, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. 
Remove the straps from behind the head or ears, without touching the front of the mask. 
As you remove the mask, lean forward and pull the mask away from your face.   
Medical masks are for single use only; discard the mask immediately, preferably into a closed bin. 
Clean your hands after touching the mask.
Be aware of the condition of the mask; replace it if it gets soiled or damp."
How should I make my own fabric mask?,"Fabric masks should be secured with elastic loops or ties, include multiple layers, be washable and reusable.
They should ideally be made of three layers of fabric. Inner layer of absorbent material, such as cotton.Middle layer of non-woven non-absorbent material, such as polypropylene.Outer layer of non-absorbent material, such as polyester or polyester blend.Watch our ‘WHO’s recommended fabric mask materials and composition’ video for more information."
"What is the difference between medical masks and respirators, like N95s?","Medical masks (also known as surgical masks)Composition: Made of three layers of synthetic nonwoven materialsConfigured to have filtration layers sandwiched in the middle. Available in different thicknesses.Have various levels of fluid-resistance and filtration. Respirators (also known as filtering facepiece respirators - FFP) are available at different performance levels such as FFP2, FFP3, N95, N99Respirator masks are designed to protect healthcare workers who provide care to COVID-19 patients in settings and areas where aerosol generating procedures are undertaken. Healthcare workers should be fit tested before using a respirator to ensure that they are wearing the correct size."
Does WHO recommend the use of masks with exhalation valves to prevent transmission of COVID-19?,"No, WHO does not recommend the use of masks with exhalation valves. These masks are intended for industrial workers to prevent dust and particles from being breathed in as the valve closes on inhale. However, the valve opens on exhale making it easier to breathe but also allowing any virus to funnel through the valve opening, making the mask ineffective at preventing the spread of COVID-19."
Does WHO recommend the use of gloves in the community to prevent transmission of COVID-19?,"No, WHO does not recommend the general use of gloves by people in the community. Instead, in public places, such as supermarkets or public/private buildings, WHO recommends the installation of public hand hygiene stations at the entrance and exit, so people can easily clean their hands. 
By widely improving hand hygiene practices, countries can help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus and other infections."
Why and where health workers should wear medical masks in the context of COVID-19?,"Health workers are the most likely to be exposed to COVID-19 because they are in close contact with patients with suspected, probable or confirmed COVID-19.Where COVID-19 is spreading, health workers and caregivers should wear a medical mask in all clinical areas of any medical facility. Masks should be worn throughout their shifts, apart from when eating, drinking or needing to change the mask for specific reasons: Health workers and caregivers include: doctors, nurses, midwives, medical attendants, cleaners, community health workers, and any others working in clinical areas.Clinical areas of particular importance are: screening/triage and emergency rooms, family physician/GP practices, outpatient departments, COVID-19 dedicated units, obstetrics, haematological, cancer and transplant units, long-term health, community care facilities and residential facilities. This means that in areas where there are patients – any patients – WHO recommends that workers in the health facility wear a medical mask, even if physical distancing can be maintained.Respirator masks are recommended for use where aerosol generating procedures are in place for a suspect/confirmed COVID-19 patient. In these settings, WHO recommends the use of airborne and contact precautions. As there are reports of health workers being infected with COVID-19 outside of health facilities, it is critical that health workers, as all people, follow the guidance to protect themselves from infection when outside of a health facility. Further resources: Healthcare workers can complete our OpenWHO course on how to put on and remove personal protective equipment.Read our guidance on ‘Infection prevention and control during health care when coronavirus disease (‎COVID-19)‎ is suspected or confirmed’. WHO first issued interim guidance on recommended practices for health workers caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in January 2020, which included following droplet/contact precautions: surgical gown, gloves, medical mask, and eye protection"
Why was the use of hydroxychloroquine stopped in the Solidarity Trial?,"On 17 June 2020, WHO announced that the hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) arm of the Solidarity Trial to find an effective COVID-19 treatment was being stopped. The trial's Executive Group and principal investigators made the decision based on evidence from the Solidarity trial, UK's Recovery trial and a Cochrane review of other evidence on hydroxychloroquine.Data from Solidarity (including the French Discovery trial data) and the recently announced results from the UK's Recovery trial both showed that hydroxychloroquine does not result in the reduction of mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, when compared with standard of care."
What will happen to the people who were already enrolled in the hydroxychloroquine arm of the trial?,Investigators will not randomize further patients to hydroxychloroquine in the Solidarity trial. Patients who have already started hydroxychloroquine but who have not yet finished their course in the trial may complete their course or stop at the discretion of the supervising physician. The use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are accepted as generally safe for use in patients with autoimmune diseases or malaria.
What is WHO’s view of the use of hydroxychloroquine in pre or post-exposure prophylaxis?,The decision to stop hydroxychloroquine’s use in the Solidarity trial does not apply to the use or evaluation of hydroxychloroquine in pre or post-exposure prophylaxis in patients exposed to COVID-19.
How many malaria-affected countries have reported cases of COVID-19?,"Malaria-endemic countries in all WHO have regions have reported cases of COVID-19. In the WHO African Region, which carries more than 90% of the global malaria burden, there have been more than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. The latest situation reports on the COVID-19 pandemic are available on the WHO website."
Should core malaria vector control interventions be maintained in view of the rapid global spread of COVID-19?,"As of March 2020, there have been reports of the suspension of insecticide-treated net (ITN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaigns in several African countries due to concerns around exposure to COVID-19. Suspending such campaigns will leave many vulnerable populations at greater risk of malaria, particularly young children and pregnant women. WHO strongly encourages countries not to suspend the planning for – or implementation of – vector control activities, including ITN and IRS campaigns, while ensuring these services are delivered using best practices to protect health workers and communities from COVID-19 infection. Modifications of planned distribution strategies may be needed to minimize exposure to the coronavirus. WHO commends the leaders of Benin, Chad, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone and Uganda for committing to move forward with ITN campaigns during the pandemic. Other countries are adapting their net distribution strategies to ensure households receive the nets as quickly and safely as possible.Together with partners, WHO has developed guidance to ensure that those suffering from malaria can safely receive the care they need in COVID-19 settings. Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 responseincludes guidance on the prevention of infection through vector control and chemoprevention, testing, treatment of cases, clinical services, supply chain and laboratory activities. The document is consistent with broader WHO guidance on how to maintain essential health services during the pandemic."
Should WHO-recommended preventive therapies be maintained in sub-Saharan Africa?,"Yes, delivery of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), and intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) should be maintained provided that best practices for protecting health workers – and other front-line workers – from COVID-19 are followed. Ensuring access to these and other core malaria prevention tools saves lives and is an important strategy for reducing the strain on health systems in the context of the COVID-19 response.Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 response, developed by WHO and partners, includes guidance on how to deliver preventive therapies for pregnant women and young children in ways that protect health workers and communities against potential COVID-19 transmission."
Are there any changes to WHO guidance with respect to malaria diagnosis and treatment?,"WHO guidance remains the same. Countries should not scale back efforts to detect and treat malaria; doing so would seriously undermine the health and well-being of millions of people infected with a potentially life-threatening disease.As signs and symptoms of malaria and COVID-19 can overlap (such as a fever), public health messages will need to be adapted in malaria-endemic settings so that people who have a fever are encouraged to seek immediate treatment rather than stay at home; without prompt treatment, a mild case of malaria can rapidly progress to severe illness and death."
What additional special measures may be needed in the context of COVID-19?,"In addition to routine approaches to malaria control, there may be a case for special measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic – such as a temporary return to presumptive malaria treatment, or the use of mass drug administration – which have proved useful in some previous emergencies. Presumptive malaria treatment refers to treatment of a suspected malaria case without the benefit of diagnostic confirmation (e.g. through a rapid diagnostic test). This approach is typically reserved for extreme circumstances, such as disease in settings where prompt diagnosis is no longer possible.Mass drug administration (MDA) is a WHO-recommended approach for rapidly reducing malaria mortality and morbidity during epidemics and in complex emergency settings. Through MDA, all individuals in a targeted population are given antimalarial medicines – often at repeated intervals – regardless of whether or not they show symptoms of the disease. Such special measures should only be adopted after careful consideration of 2 key aims: lowering malaria-related mortality and keeping health workers and communities safe. WHO is exploring concrete proposals for when and how to activate such measures; guidance will be published in due course."
What is the Solidarity Trial?,"The Solidarity Trial is an international clinical trial to help find an effective treatment for COVID-19, launched by WHO and partners. It is hoped that one or more of the treatments under trial will result in improving clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients and save lives. Other trials are on-going around the world in addition to the Solidarity Trial. The treatment options are: Remdesivir; Lopinavir/Ritonavir; and Lopinavir/Ritonavir with Interferon beta-1a. The treatment options were originally selected based on evidence from laboratory, animal and clinical studies. Hydroxychloroquine was originally included in the trial but this arm was stopped, as of 17 June 2020, as evidence showed it did not result in the reduction of mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, when compared with standard of care.Over 100 countries have expressed an interest in participating in the trial and WHO is actively supporting more than 60 of them, including with the following:ethical and regulatory approvals of the WHO core protocol;identification of hospitals participating in the trial;training of hospital clinicians on the web-based randomization and data system;shipping the trial drugs as requested by each participating country.As of 3 June 2020, more than 3500 patients have been recruited in 35 countries, with over 400 hospitals actively recruiting patients. Interim trial analyses are monitored by a Global Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, which is an independent group of experts."
What are the key considerations for countries that are working to eliminate malaria or prevent re-establishment of transmission?,"All of the considerations described above apply to malaria-eliminating countries and those preventing re-establishment of the disease: efforts must be sustained to prevent, detect and treat malaria cases while preventing the spread of COVID-19 and ensuring the safety of those who deliver the services. Countries that are nearing malaria elimination must protect their important gains and avoid malaria resurgences. Countries that have eliminated malaria must remain vigilant for any imported cases of malaria that may be occurring to prevent reintroduction of the disease."
Why is WHO particularly concerned about the spread of COVID-19 in malaria-affected areas?,"Experience from previous disease outbreaks has shown the disruptive effect on health service delivery and the consequences for diseases such as malaria. The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, for example, undermined malaria control efforts and led to a massive increase in malaria-related illness and death in the 3 countries.A modelling analysis from WHO and partners, published on 23 April, found that the number of malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could double this year alone if there are severe disruptions in access to insecticide-treated nets and antimalarial medicines due to COVID-19. These projections reinforce the critical importance of sustaining efforts to prevent, detect and treat malaria during the pandemic.In all regions, protective measures should be utilized to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission between patients, communities and health providers. WHO and partners have developed guidance on how to safely maintain malaria prevention and treatment services in COVID-19 settings."
Have there been disruptions in the global supply of key malaria-related commodities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Yes. Since the early days of the pandemic, there have been reports of disruptions in the supply chains of essential malaria commodities – such as long-lasting insecticidal nets, rapid diagnostic tests and antimalarial medicines – resulting from lockdowns and from a suspension of the importation and exportation of goods in response to COVID-19. WHO and partners are working together to ensure the availability of key malaria control tools, particularly in countries with a high burden of the disease, and that efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 do not compromise access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment services."
What is WHO’s position on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the context of the COVID-19 response?,"WHO is actively following the ongoing clinical trials that are being conducted in response to COVID-19, including the more than 80 studies looking at the use of chloroquine and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine, for treatment and/or prevention. To date, 3 large randomized controlled trials, including the WHO Solidarity trial, have failed to show that the use of hydroxychloroquine among hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19 can prevent death or disease progression. Additionally, 3 trials of patients with mild or moderate disease failed to show a significant benefit in prevention of respiratory failure through the use of hydroxychloroquine. Thus, there is now growing evidence that hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment for COVID-19. This evidence will inform the next update of WHO guidance on therapeutics. Studies on the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to prevent individuals, particularly those at high risk such as health care workers, from contracting COVID-19 are ongoing. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to assess the protective efficacy of either of these medicines for the prevention of COVID-19 infection or disease. WHO cautions physicians against administering these unproven treatments to patients with COVID-19 outside the context of a clinical trial. Individuals are also advised against self-medicating with these drugs.For public health emergencies, WHO has a systematic and transparent process for research and development (R&D), including for clinical trials of drugs. The WHO “R&D Blueprint” for COVID-19, initiated on 7 January 2020, aims to fast-track the availability of effective tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives and avert large-scale crises."
How does COVID-19 spread between people?,"COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads between people, mainly when an infected person is in close contact with another person.The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe heavily. These liquid particles are different sizes, ranging from larger ‘respiratory droplets’ to smaller ‘aerosols’.Other people can catch COVID-19 when the virus gets into their mouth, nose or eyes, which is more likely to happen when people are in direct or close contact (less than 1 metre apart) with an infected person.Current evidence suggests that the main way the virus spreads is by respiratory droplets among people who are in close contact with each other.Aerosol transmission can occur in specific settings, particularly in indoor, crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces, where infected person(s) spend long periods of time with others, such as restaurants, choir practices, fitness classes, nightclubs, offices and/or places of worship. More studies are underway to better understand the conditions in which aerosol transmission is occurring outside of medical facilities where specific medical procedures, called aerosol generating procedures, are conducted.The virus can also spread after infected people sneeze, cough on, or touch surfaces, or objects, such as tables, doorknobs and handrails. Other people may become infected by touching these contaminated surfaces, then touching their eyes, noses or mouths without having cleaned their hands first.Find out more about the science about how the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the body and how our body’s immune system reacts by watching or reading this interview with WHO’s technical lead for COVID-19, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove."
When do infected people transmit the virus?,"Whether or not they have symptoms, infected people can be contagious and the virus can spread from them to other people.Laboratory data suggests that infected people appear to be most infectious just before they develop symptoms (namely 2 days before they develop symptoms) and early in their illness. People who develop severe disease can be infectious for longer.While someone who never develops symptoms can pass the virus to others, it is still not clear how frequently this occurs and more research is needed in this area."
What is the difference between people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic? Don’t they both mean someone without symptoms?,"Both terms refer to people who do not have symptoms. The difference is that ‘asymptomatic’ refers to people who are infected but never develop any symptoms, while ‘pre-symptomatic’ refers to infected people who have not yet developed symptoms but go on to develop symptoms later."
Are there certain settings where COVID-19 can spread more easily?,"Any situation in which people are in close proximity to one another for long periods of time increases the risk of transmission. Indoor locations, especially settings where there is poor or no ventilation, are riskier than outdoor locations.Transmission can occur more easily in the “Three C’s”:Crowded places with many people nearby;Close-contact settings, especially where people have conversations very near each other;Confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.  The risk of COVID-19 spreading is higher in places where these “3Cs” overlap.In health facilities, some medical procedures, called aerosol generating procedures, can produce very small droplets (called ‘droplet nuclei’ or ‘aerosols’) that can stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time. This is why health workers performing these procedures take specific airborne protection measures, including using appropriate personal protective equipment, including respirators, and why visitors are not permitted in areas in which these procedures are being performed."
How can I reduce my risk of getting COVID-19?,"To limit the risks of getting COVID-19 follow these basic precautions:Follow local guidance. Check to see what national, regional and local authorities are advising so you have the most relevant information for where you are.Stay at least 1 metre away from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick.Wear a mask, especially when you can’t physically distance.
            Read our Masks and COVID-19 Q&A and watch our videos on how to wear and make masks.Manage your risks by thinking about location and setting of the event, proximity to others and time you will be at the event. In other words, consider where you are going, how close you will be to other people and how long you will be there. Avoid
            crowded places and events, poorly ventilated indoor locations and prolonged contact with others.
            Read our Q&A about how to stay safe when attending and organizing small gatheringsOpen windows when indoors to increase the amount of outdoor air.
            Read our Q&A about ventilation and air conditioning and COVID-19.Avoid touching surfaces, especially in public settings, because someone with COVID-19 could have touched them before. Clean surfaces regularly with standard disinfectants.Frequently clean your hands with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub. If you can, carry alcohol-based rub with you and use it often.Cover your coughs and sneezes with a bent elbow or tissue, throwing used tissues into a closed bin right away. Then wash your hands or use an alcohol-based hand rub.Read our public advice page for more information."
When should a patient with COVID-19 be cared for at home?,"Ideally, all patients with COVID-19 are cared for in a healthcare facility. However, there may be some circumstances where patients may not require hospitalization or inpatient care is unavailable or unsafe, such as when capacity is insufficient to meet the demand for healthcare services. Patients should be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the health worker to determine where their care needs can best be met."
What factors determine whether a COVID-19 patient can be cared for at home?,"Patients with mild or moderate disease can be considered for home care if the home setting is suitable for the isolation and care of a COVID-19 patient, and if the patient is under the age of 60, does not smoke, is not obese, and does not have other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression. An assessment about home care for each patient should be based on the following factors:Clinical evaluation of the patient.Evaluation of the patient’s home setting according to infection prevention and control (IPC) criteria (e.g., ability to carry out hand and respiratory hygiene, environmental cleaning, adequate ventilation, limitations on movement around or from the house).Presence of vulnerable people at higher risk of COVID-19 in the home.Ability of a caregiver to provide care and closely monitor the evolution of the patient’s health, at least once per day, and to recognize signs and symptoms of any worsening of the health status. Availability of trained health workers to support the patient and caregiver (home-based, phone, telemedicine, trained community workers or outreach teams). If adequate isolation from others in the home and infection prevention control measures cannot be ensured, then isolation in designated community facilities or a health facility may need to be arranged, with consent from the patient and in agreement with the caregiver and household members. It is important to note that in areas with other endemic infections that cause fever, such as influenza, malaria, dengue, etc., febrile patients should seek medical care, be tested and treated for those endemic infections per routine protocols, irrespective of the presence of respiratory signs and symptoms.  Home care does not replace healthcare by professionals. Those patients who receive homecare should be regularly monitored by health workers."
What additional factors should be taken into consideration when assessing the home setting to determine if it is safe for patients and families to remain at home?,"There are a number of environmental and social factors to consider for patients to safely remain at home with their families or household members. An overall needs assessment of the patient and family that includes the availability of trained health workers
    for support should be conducted. A detailed description is available in the Appendix, Box 2, of the guidance."
What precautions should health workers take when providing care to patients in home settings?,"Health workers should take the following precautions:Perform a risk assessment to select the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as a medical mask, eye protection, gloves and gown when caring for the patient.Implement infection prevention and control measures, including hand hygiene.Ensure the room where the patient is cared for is well ventilated, opening windows if necessary.Provide instructions to caregivers and household members on cleaning and disinfection in the home, and on management of waste, laundry and utensils related to the patient.Request the patient to wear a medical mask when providing care or within a 1-metre distance.Request limiting the number of household members during visits and maintaining at least a 1-metre distance.Remove PPE and discard what is disposable, then perform hand hygiene before leaving the home.Make sure that the waste generated from providing care to the patient be placed in strong bags or safety boxes as appropriate, closed completely, disposed as infectious waste and removed from the home."
Could pregnant women be cared for at home if they have COVID-19?,"Pregnant women with mild or moderate disease can be considered for home care if the home setting is suitable for the isolation and care of a COVID-19 patient, if they do not smoke, are not obese, and do not have other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression. An assessment about home care for each patient should be based on the following factors:Clinical evaluation of the patient.Evaluation of the patient’s home setting according to IPC criteria (e.g., ability to carry out hand and respiratory hygiene, environmental cleaning, limitations on movement around or from the house).Presence of vulnerable people at higher risk of COVID-19 in the home.Ability of a caregiver to provide care and closely monitor the evolution of the patient’s health, at least once per day, and to recognize signs and symptoms of any worsening of the health status. Availability of trained health workers to support the patient and caregiver (home-based, phone, telemedicine, trained community workers or outreach teams)."
Can children be cared for at home if they have COVID-19?,"Children should be kept together with their parents or caregivers wherever possible. Children with mild or moderate disease can be considered for home care if the home setting is suitable for the isolation and care of a COVID-19 patient, if they are not obese, do not smoke, and do not have other conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, or immunosuppression.Caregivers of children with COVID-19 should monitor for signs and symptoms of clinical deterioration requiring urgent re-evaluation. These include difficulty breathing/fast or shallow breathing (for infants: grunting, inability to breastfeed), blue lips or face, chest pain or pressure, new confusion, inability to awaken/not interacting when awake, inability to drink or keep down any liquids. If caregivers are suspected or have confirmed COVID-19 infection, medical and non-medical factors must be taken into account due to the negative and possible long-term consequences of even a short period of family separation.Community protection focal points and caseworkers should help families plan–in advance–agreements for the care of children in case the caregiver becomes ill.  Children living with primary caregivers who are elderly, disabled or have underlying health conditions should be prioritized."
"How can you clean soiled bedding, towels and linens from patients with COVID-19?","All individuals dealing with soiled bedding, towels and clothes from patients with COVID-19 should: Wear appropriate personal protective equipment, which includes heavy duty gloves, mask, eye protection (face shield/goggles), long-sleeved gown, apron (if gown is not fluid resistant), boots or closed shoes before touching any soiled linen.Never carry soiled linen against body; place soiled linen in a clearly labelled, leak-proof container (e.g. bag, bucket)If there is any solid excrement on the linen, such as feces or vomit, scrape it off carefully with a flat, firm object and put it in the commode or designated toilet/latrine before putting linen in the designated container. If the latrine is not in the same room as the patient, place soiled excrement in covered bucket to dispose of in the toilet or latrine; Wash and disinfect linen: washing by machine with warm water (60-90°C) and laundry detergent is recommended for cleaning and disinfection of linens. If machine washing is not possible, linen can be soaked in hot water and soap in a large drum, using a stick to stir, avoiding splashing. If hot water not available, soak linen in 0.05% chlorine for approximately 30 minutes.  Finally, rinse with clean water and let linen dry fully in the sunlight.  Additional resources for best practices for environmental cleaning can be found in the following two documents: 1) Infection prevention and control of epidemic-and pandemic prone acute respiratory infections in health care2) Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning in Healthcare Facilities in Resource-Limited Settings which was developed by CDC and ICAN in collaboration with WHO"
"What are the recommendation regarding disinfection of vehicles, goods and products coming from China or other COVID-19 affected countries?","To date there is no epidemiological information to suggest
that contact with goods, products or vehicles shipped from COVID-19 affected
countries have been the source of COVID-19 in humans.For these reasons, there is no disinfection recommendations
for any goods and products coming from COVID-19 affected countries given that
there is no available evidence that these products pose a risk to public
health. WHO will continue to closely monitor the evolution of
COVID-19, and will update the recommendations as needed."
What is WHO’s position on the use of Artemisia plant material for the prevention or treatment of malaria and/or COVID-19?,"The most widely used antimalarial treatments, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), are produced using the pure artemisinin compound extracted from the plant Artemisia annua. There have been reports that products or extracts (e.g. herbal teas or tablets) made from Artemisia plant material may have a preventive or curative effect on COVID-19. However, available in vitro data suggests that purified artemisinin compounds or A. annua plant product or extracts do not have an appreciable effect against COVID-19 at concentrations that could be safely achieved in humans. As such, current evidence does not support the use of artemisinins or A. annua products or extracts as an antiviral for COVID-19. WHO urges extreme caution over reports touting the efficacy of such products. As explained in a WHO position statement, there is no scientific evidence base to support the use of non-pharmaceutical forms of Artemisia for the prevention or treatment of malaria. There is also no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 can be prevented or treated with products made from Artemisia-based plant material."
What is WHO doing to support malaria-affected countries in the context of COVID-19?,"The WHO Global Malaria Programme is leading a cross-partner effort to mitigate the negative impact of the coronavirus in malaria-affected countries and, where possible, contribute towards a successful COVID-19 response. The work is being carried out in close collaboration with colleagues based at WHO headquarters, regional offices and country level.In March 2020, before the pandemic had secured a strong footing in Africa, WHO sounded an urgent call for maintaining core malaria prevention and treatment services while protecting health workers and communities against COVID-19 transmission. The findings of a modelling analysis from WHO and partners, published in April, reinforced the WHO call for continuity of malaria services during then pandemic.In collaboration with partners, WHO developed technical guidance for countries on how to safely maintain malaria prevention and treatment in COVID-19 settings. Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 response is consistent with broader WHO guidance on how to maintain essential health services during the pandemic."
What personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used by healthcare workers (HCW) performing nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swabs on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19?,"Health care workers collecting NP and OP swab specimens from suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients should be well-trained on the procedure and should wear a clean, non-sterile, long-sleeve gown, a medical mask, eye protection (i.e., googles or face shield), and gloves. Procedure should be conducted in a separate/isolation room, and during NP specimen collection health care workers should request the patients to cover their mouth with a medical mask or tissue. Although collection of NP and OP swabs have the potential to induce fits of coughing from the patient undergoing the procedure, there is no currently available evidence that cough generated via NP/OP specimen collection leads to increased risk of COVID-19 transmission via aerosols."
Should blood centers routinely screen blood products for COVID-19 virus?,"No, although RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in blood of symptomatic COVID-19 patients, this does not mean that the virus is viable/infectious. In general, respiratory viruses are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion. Blood centers should have routine blood donor screening measures in place to prevent individuals with respiratory symptoms or fever from donating blood.  As precautionary measures, blood centers might encourage self-deferral of those with travel history to an COVID-19 affected country in the previous 14 days, or of those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or are close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case."
"Are boots, impermeable aprons, or coverall suits required as routine personal protective equipment (PE) for healthcare workers (HCW) caring for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection?","No. Current WHO guidance for HCW caring for suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients recommends the use of contact and droplet precautions, in addition to standard precautions which should always be used by all HCW for all patients.
    In terms of PPE, contact and droplet precautions include wearing disposable gloves to protect hands, and clean, non-sterile, long-sleeve gown to protect clothes from contamination, medical masks to protect nose and mouth, and eye protection (e.g.,
    goggles, face shield), before entering the room where suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients are admitted. Respirators (e.g. N95) are only required for aerosol generating procedures.Click here for more information on PPE for HCW caring for suspected or confirmed nCoV patients."
Can disposable medical face masks be sterilized and reused?,"No. Disposable medical face masks are intended for a single use only. After use they should be removed using appropriate techniques (i.e. do no touch the front, remove by pulling the elastic ear straps or laces from behind) and disposed of immediately
    in an infectious waste bin with a lid, followed by hand hygiene.Click here for more information on using masks in the context of the nCoV outbreak."
Why does WHO recommend contact and droplet precautions and not routine use of airborne precautions for healthcare workers providing care to patients with suspected/confirmed 2019-nCoV infection?,"WHO developed its rapid guidance based on the consensus of international experts who considered the currently available evidence on the modes of transmission of 2019-nCoV. This evidence demonstrates viral transmission by droplets and contact with contaminated
    surfaces of equipment; it does not support routine airborne transmission. Airborne transmission may happen, as has been shown with other viral respiratory diseases, during aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy), thus
    WHO recommends airborne precautions for these procedures. Click here for more information about healthcare worker protection for 2019-nCoV."
Does WHO recommend routine wearing masks for healthy people during the 2019 nCoV outbreak?,"No. WHO does not recommend that asymptomatic individuals (i.e., who do not have respiratory symptoms) in the community should wear medical masks, as currently there is no evidence that routine use of medical masks by healthy individuals prevents 2019-nCoV
    transmission. Masks are recommended to be used by symptomatic persons in the community. Misuse and overuse of medical masks may cause serious issues of shortage of stocks and lack of mask availability for those who actually need to wear them. In health care facilities where health care workers are directly taking care of suspect or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients, masks are an important part of containing 2019-nCoV spread between people, along with other PPE and hand
    hygiene.Click here for more information on medical mask use."
Can patients with suspected and confirmed nCoV infection be cohorted in the same room?,"Ideally, suspected and confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients should be isolated in single rooms. However, when this is not feasible (e.g., limited number of single rooms), cohorting is an acceptable option. Some patients with suspected 2019-nCoV infection may actually have other respiratory illnesses, hence they must be cohorted separately from patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. A minimum of 1-meter distance between beds should be maintained at all times."
Do patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV need to be hospitalized if they have mild illness?,"No. For patients who have mild illness, e.g., low-grade fever, cough, malaise, rhinorrhoea, sore throat without any warning signs, such as shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing, increased respiratory (i.e. sputum or haemoptysis), gastro-intestinal
    symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea and without changes in mental status, hospitalization may not be required unless there is concern for rapid clinical deterioration. All patients discharged home should be instructed to return to
    hospital if they develop any worsening of illness.Click here for more information on admission criteria.Click here for more information on caring for mildly symptomatic 2019-nCoV patients at home."
Are specialized or referral hospitals required for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection when hospitalization is needed?,"No. Current WHO recommendations do not include a requirement for exclusive use of specialized or referral hospitals to treat suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients. However, countries or local jurisdictions may choose to care for patients at such hospitals if those are deemed the most likely to be able to safely care for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection or for other clinical reasons (e.g., availability of advanced life support). Regardless, any healthcare facility treating patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV patients should adhere to the WHO infection prevention and control recommendations for healthcare to protect patients, staff and visitors. Click here for the guidance."
Are people living with HIV at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19?,"People living with HIV with advanced disease, those with low CD4 and high viral load and those who are not taking antiretroviral treatment have an increased risk of infections and related complications in general.  It is unknown if the immunosuppression of HIV will put a person at greater risk for COVID-19, thus, until more is known, additional precautions for all people with advanced HIV or poorly controlled HIV, should be employed[1],[2].At present there is no evidence that the risk of infection or complications of COVID-19 is different among people living with HIV who are clinically and immunologically stable on antiretroviral treatment when compared with the general population.  Some people living with HIV may have known risk factors for COVID-19 complications, such as diabetes, hypertension and other noncommunicable diseases and as such may have increased risk of COVID-19 unrelated to HIV.  We know that during the SARS and MERS outbreaks there were only a few case reports of mild disease among people living with HIV.  To date, there is a case report of a person living with HIV who had COVID-19 and recovered[3] and a small study on risk factors and antiretrovirals used among people living with HIV with COVID-19 from China.  This study reported similar rates of COVID-19 disease as compared to the entire population and increased risk with older age, but not with low CD4, high viral load level or antiretroviral regimen[4]. Current clinical data suggest the main mortality risk factors are linked to older age and other comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension. Some very healthy people have also developed severe disease from the coronavirus infection[5].  PLHIV are advised to take the same precautions as the general population[6],[7]: wash hands oftencough etiquette physical distancingseek medical care if symptomaticself-isolation if in contact with someone with COVID-19 and other actions per the government response   People living with HIV who are taking antiretroviral drugs should ensure that they have at least 30 days and up to 6-month supply of medicines and ensure that their vaccinations are up to date (influenza and pneumococcal vaccines). Adequate supplies of medicines to treat co-infections and comorbidities and addiction should also be ensured."
Can COVID-19 be transmitted at the workplace?,"COVID-19 spreads primarily through respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces. Exposure can occur at the workplace, while travelling to work, during work-related travel to an area with local community transmission, as well as on the way to and from the workplace."
What is the risk of contracting COVID-19 in the workplace?,"The risk of exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace depends on the likelihood of coming within 1 metre of others, in having frequent physical contact with people who may be infected with COVID-19, and through contact with contaminated surfaces and objects."
How can people assess the risk for exposure to COVID-19 in their workplace and plan for preventive measures?,"Managers with the support of an occupational health and safety advisor should carry out rapid risk assessments to determine the possibility of exposure risk in order to put in place preventive measures. This should be done for each specific work setting and each job.Low exposure risk Jobs or work without frequent, close contact with the general public or others. Workers in this group have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers. Examples of such jobs may include remote workers (i.e., working from home), office workers without frequent close contact with others and workers providing teleservices.Medium exposure risk Jobs or tasks with close, frequent contact with the general public or others. This risk level may apply to workers who have frequent and close contact with the people in high-population-density work environments (e.g. food markets, bus stations, public transport, and other work activities where physical distancing of at least 1 metre may be difficult to observe), or tasks that require close and frequent contact between co-workers. This may also include frequent contact with people returning from areas with community transmission. Examples of such jobs may include frontline workers in retail, home deliveries, accommodation, construction, police and security, public transport, and water and sanitation. High exposure risk Jobs or tasks with close contact with people who may be more likely to have COVID-19, as well as contact with objects and surfaces possibly contaminated with the virus. Examples include transporting people known or suspected to have COVID-19 without separation between the driver and the passenger, providing domestic services or home care for people with COVID-19, and having contact with the deceased who were known or suspected of having COVID-19 at the time of their death. Jobs that may fall under this category include domestic workers, social care workers, personal transport  and home delivery providers and home repair technicians (plumbers, electricians) who have to provide services in the homes of people with COVID-19."
Who should carry out the workplace risk assessment?,"Employers and managers, in consultation with workers, should carry out and regularly update the risk assessment for work-related exposure to COVID-19, preferably with the support of occupational health services."
What are the key considerations for the workplace risk assessment?,"For each risk assessment, consider the environment, the task, the threat, resources available, such as personal protective equipment, and the feasibility of protective measures. The risk assessment should also extend to collective accommodation provided by the employer for workers, such as dormitories.  Essential public services, such as security and police, food retail, accommodation, public transport, deliveries, water and sanitation, and other frontline workers may be at an increased risk of exposure to occupational hazards for health and safety. Workers who may be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 illness because of age or pre-existing medical conditions should be considered in the risk assessment for individuals."
Can someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 be cared for at home?,"People with no symptoms should be able to stay at home, if adequately isolated from others, but this should be confirmed by a doctor. Those with mild or moderate disease can be considered for home care if they are under the age of 60, do not smoke, are not obese, and do not have other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression. A health worker will assess risk factors along with the person’s symptoms, medical history and ability for the family to manage the care. Household members need to limit shared spaces, practice the recommended hygiene and know how to recognize and respond to signs of worsening health.A trained health worker will need to assess whether the home in question is suitable for the isolation and care of a COVID-19 patient, and proper infection prevention control measures are put in place. Trained health workers are also important to support the patient and family in the home, or by phone, telemedicine, or outreach teams."
What should be done to prevent other people in the house from becoming sick if a person with COVID-19 is being cared for at home?,"There are a number of precautions that can prevent the spread of COVID-19 to other people in the house:The ill person should stay in a separate room; if this is not possible, then keep at least a 1-metre distance from him or her. Provide good ventilation in the room of the ill person and shared spaces, and open windows if possible and safe to do so.The ill person should wear a medical mask as much as possible, in particular when not alone in the room and when a 1-metre distance from others cannot be maintained.Visitors should not be allowed in the home.Limit the number of caregivers to one person with no underlying conditions, if possible.Caregivers and household members should wear a medical mask while in the same room with an ill person, not touch their mask or face during use, discard the mask after leaving the room, and wash their hands afterward.The ill person should have dedicated dishes, cups, eating utensils, towels and bed linens. They should be washed with soap and water, and not shared.Frequently touched surfaces by the ill person should be cleaned and disinfected at least daily.Everyone in the household should wash their hands with soap and water regularly, especially:
        after coughing or sneezingbefore during and after you prepare foodbefore eatingafter using the toiletbefore and after caring for the ill personwhen hands are visibly dirtyA cough or sneeze should be covered with a flexed elbow or a disposable tissue that is discarded immediately after use.The waste from the ill person should be packed in strong closed bags before disposal."
How long should people with COVID-19 stay at home and in isolation?,"People with COVID-19 who are cared for at home should stay in isolation until they are no longer able to transmit the virus to others:Those with symptoms should stay isolated for a minimum of 10 days after the first day they developed symptoms, plus another 3 days after the end of symptoms – when they are without fever and without respiratory symptoms.People without symptoms should stay isolated for a minimum of 10 days after testing positive."
What are the disinfectants recommended for environmental cleaning in healthcare facilities or homes housing patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection?,"Environmental cleaning in healthcare facilities or homes housing patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection should use disinfectants that are active against enveloped viruses, such as 2019-nCoV and other coronaviruses. There are many disinfectants,
    including commonly used hospital disinfectants, that are active against enveloped viruses. Currently WHO recommendations include the use of:70% Ethyl alcohol to disinfect reusable dedicated equipment (e.g., thermometers) between usesSodium hypochlorite at 0.5% (equivalent 5000ppm) for disinfection of frequently touched surfaces in homes or healthcare facilitiesClick here for the guidance on clinical management of severe acute
    respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected.Click here  for the guidance on infection prevention and control during health care when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected.Click here for more information about environmental cleaning."
How long the 2019-nCoV can survive on a dry surface?,"There is currently no data available on stability of 2019-nCoV on surfaces.  Data from laboratory studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have shown that stability in the environment depends on several factors including relative temperature, humidity, and surface type. WHO continues to monitor existing evidence around nCoV and will update when such evidence is available."
Is there a special procedure regarding waste produced by patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV?,No. Waste produced during the health care or home care of patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection should be disposed of as infectious waste.Click here for more information on disposing of infectious waste.Click here to visit the CDC website.
Are there special procedures for the management of bodies of persons who have died from 2019-nCoV?,"No, there are no special procedures for the management of bodies of persons who have died from 2019-nCoV. Authorities and medical facilities should proceed with their existing policies and regulations that guide post-mortem management of persons who died from infectious diseases."
Is there a model for setting up an isolation ward and types and products and health requirements?,A model for setting up an isolation ward is currently under development. PPE specifications for healthcare workers caring for nCoV patients can be found  in the disease commodity package at: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/disease-commodity-package---novel-coronavirus-(ncov)
Can chlorine solutions also be used?,"Chlorine solutions are strongly discouraged as they carry a higher risk of hand irritation and ill health effects from making and diluting chlorine solutions, including eye irritation and respiratory problems. In addition, there is a risk of loss of antimicrobial effect if exposed to sunlight or heat.  Preparing chlorine solutions requires training to reach the correct dose of 0.05% with varying strengths of bleach available in the private sector.  Even if stored at a cool dry place with a lid away from sunlight, they have to be renewed daily.  In comparison simple soapy water solution do not have any of the above-mentioned health risks and complications including loss of antiviral effect due to heat or sunlight.  The antiviral effect of soapy water is due to the oily surface membrane of the COVID-virus that is dissolved by soap, killing the virus."
Can antiretrovirals be used to treat COVID-19?,"Several studies have suggested that patients infected with the virus causing COVID-19, and the related coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) had good clinical outcomes, with almost all cases recovering fully.  In some cases, patients were given an antiretroviral drug: lopinavir boosted with ritonavir (LPV/r). These studies were mostly carried out in HIV-negative individuals.It is important to note that these studies using LPV/r had important limitations. The studies were small, timing, duration and dosing for treatment were varied and most patients received co-interventions/co-treatments which may have contributed to the reported outcomes. While the evidence of benefit of using antiretrovirals to treat coronavirus infections is of very low certainty, serious side effects were rare. Among people living with HIV, the routine use of LPV/r as treatment for HIV is associated with several side effects of moderate severity. However, as the duration of treatment in patients with coronavirus infections was generally limited to a few weeks, these occurrences can be expected to be low or less than that reported from routine use."
Can antiretrovirals be used to prevent COVID-19 infection?,"Two studies have reported the use of LPV/r as post-exposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. One of these studies suggested that the occurrence of MERS-CoV infection was lower among health workers receiving LPV/r compared to those who did not receive any drugs; the other study found no cases of SARS-CoV infection among 19 people living with HIV hospitalized in the same ward of SARS patients, of whom 11 were on antiretroviral therapy. Again, the certainty of the evidence is very low due to small sample size, variability in drugs provided, and uncertainty regarding intensity of exposure."
"How should employers decide when to open, close or re-open workplaces and/or suspend or downscale work activities?","Deciding to close or re-open a workplace or suspend or downscale work activities should rely on the risk assessment, the capacity to put in place protective measures and the level of compliance, and recommendations of national authorities."
What key measures to protect against COVID-19 should be undertaken in ALL workplaces?,"Measures to prevent transmission of COVID-19 that apply to all workplaces and all people at the workplace include frequent hand-washing or disinfection with alcohol based hand sanitizer, respiratory hygiene such as covering coughs, physical distancing of at least 1 metre or more according to the national recommendations, wearing of masks where distancing is not possible, regular environmental cleaning and disinfection, and limiting unnecessary travel. Clear policies and messages, training, and education for staff and managers to increase awareness of COVID-19 are essential. The management of people with COVID-19 or their contacts is also critical e.g. requiring workers who are unwell or who develop symptoms to stay at home, self isolate and contact a medical professional or the local COVID-19 information line for advice on testing and referral."
What additional measures should be taken at workplaces and for jobs at medium risk?,"Workplaces for jobs at medium risk require daily cleaning and disinfection at least two times a day of objects and surfaces that are touched regularly, including all shared rooms, surfaces, floors, bathrooms, and changing rooms. Consider suspending any activity where physical distancing of at least 1 metre cannot be implemented in full. If this is not possible, increase ventilation, implement enhanced regular hand hygiene, and require staff to wear appropriate face masks, goggles, gloves and work clothes during cleaning procedures that generate splashes, providing training on their use. Organize changing and washing of work clothes at the workplace, so that workers to do take them home."
What additional measures should be taken at workplaces and for jobs at high risk?,"In work areas at high risk, assess the possibility of suspending the activity; enhance regular hand hygiene; provide medical masks, disposable gowns, gloves, and eye protection for workers who must work in the homes of people who are suspected or known to have COVID-19; train workers in infection prevention and control practices and use of personal protective equipment; avoid assigning tasks with high risk to workers who have pre-existing medical conditions, are pregnant, or older than 60 years of age."
What should be taken into consideration when setting a physical distance at the workplace?,"WHO recommends keeping a physical distance of at least 1 metre between each person in all settings, including in workplaces. Because transmission can occur in crowded workplaces, WHO recommends providing sufficient space, at least 10 square meters, for every worker. National recommendations for physical distancing may require greater physical distance and should be complied with. In order to support compliance with national or local recommendations, implement physical distance guidelines in a way that is practical and feasible in the context of work tasks, and which is acceptable to both workers and employers. Stimulate workers to comply with physical distancing norms also at events outside the workplace, in the community, and in dormitories. Risk assessment and consultation between employers and workers is very important for setting up and implementing physical distancing measures at the workplace. This may require modification of workstations, changing the use of common spaces and transport vehicles, staggered work shifts, split teams and other measures to reduce social mixing at the workplace. If physical distancing measures at the workplace are not feasible for specific work tasks, consider whether the work can be suspended, and if this is not possible, apply additional protective measures, such as the use of screens, sneeze guards,  face masks, enhanced hand hygiene, ventilation and disinfection.Physical distancing alone can’t prevent COVID-19 transmission, it is important that it is combined with other public health measures, such as hand and respiratory hygiene, environmental clean-up and disinfection of commonly touched surfaces and objects, ventilation, wearing face masks and a policy of staying at home if unwell."
"What are the rights, duties and responsibilities of employers?","Employers, workers, and their organizations should collaborate with health authorities to prevent and control COVID-19. Cooperation between management and workers and their representatives is essential for workplace‐related prevention measures. International labour standards on the rights and responsibilities of workers and employers in occupational safety and health should be fully respected. Employers, in consultation with workers and their representatives, should plan and implement measures to prevent and mitigate COVID-19 at the workplace through engineering and administrative controls, and provide personal protective equipment and clothing according to the risk assessment. Such measures should not involve any expenditure on the part of the workers.Special measures are needed to protect workers at higher risk of developing severe disease, such as those age 60 and over, or with underlying medical conditions, upon recommendation of the occupational health services. Workers in the informal economy and digital labour platforms, those in small enterprises, domestic and migrant workers should not be left behind in the protection of their health and safety at work and their livelihood.   There should be no social stigma or discrimination at the workplace for any reason, including access to information and protection from COVID-19, occupational health services and mental health and psychosocial support. If COVID-19 is contracted through occupational exposure, it could be considered an occupational disease and, if so determined, should be reported and compensated according to the international labour standards and the national schemes for employment injury benefits."
"What are the rights, duties and responsibilities of workers?","Workers are responsible to follow the measures for occupational safety and health and infection prevention and control established for their workplace, and to participate in training provided by the employer. Workers should report to their supervisor any situation which may present an imminent and serious danger to their life or health. Workers have the right to remove themselves from any work situation that they have reasonable justification to believe presents an imminent and serious danger to their life or health, and should be protected from any undue consequences as a result of exercising this right."
What studies on treatment and prevention of COVID-19 with antiretrovirals are being planned?,"Several randomized trials are planned to assess the safety and efficacy of using antiretroviral drugs – mainly LPV/r – for treating COVID-19, in combination with other drugs. Results are expected from mid-2020 onwards."
What is WHO’s position on the use of antiretrovirals for the treatment of COVID-19?,"Currently, there is insufficient data to assess the effectiveness of LPV/r or other antivirals for treating COVID-19. Several countries are evaluating the use of LPV/r and other antivirals and we welcome the results of these investigations.Again, as part of WHO’s response to the outbreak, the WHO R&D Blueprint has been activated to accelerate evaluation of diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for this novel coronavirus. WHO has also designed a set of procedures to assess the performance, quality and safety of medical technologies during emergency situations."
What is WHO’s position on use of corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19?,The current interim guidance from WHO on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when COVID-19 infection is suspected advises against the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason.[8]This guidance is based on several systematic reviews that cite lack of effectiveness and possible harm from routine treatment with corticosteroids for viral pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.[9]
"If countries use antiretrovirals for COVID-19, are there concerns about treatment shortages for people living with HIV?","Antiretrovirals are an efficacious and highly tolerable treatment for people living with HIV. The antiretroviral LPV/r is currently being investigated as a possible treatment for COVID-19.If they are to be used for the treatment of COVID-19, a plan should be in place to ensure there is adequate and continuous supply to cover the needs of all people living with HIV already using LPV/r and those who will need to begin treatment. However, a relatively small proportion of people are on regimens which include LPV/r, since it is used as a second-line regimen according to WHO’s HIV treatment guidelines. Any country that allows the use of HIV medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 must ensure that an adequate and sustainable supply is in place."
How do we ensure human rights and reduce stigma and discrimination?,"As the world scales up public health responses to the COVID19 pandemic, countries are being urged to take decisive action to control the epidemic. WHO has urged all countries to ensure an appropriate balance between protecting health, preventing economic and social disruption, and respecting human rights.  WHO is working with partners including the UNAIDS Joint Programme and the Global Network of People Living with HIV to ensure that human rights are not eroded in the response to COVID-19 and to ensure that people living with or affected by HIV are offered the same access to services as others and to ensure HIV-related services continue without disruption.To mitigate potential prison outbreaks of COVID19 and reduce morbidity and mortality among people in prisons and other closed settings, it is crucial that prisons and immigration detention centres are embedded within the broader public health response. This requires close collaboration between health and justice ministries and includes protocols for entry screening, personal protection measures, physical distancing, environmental cleaning and disinfection, and restriction of movement, including limitation of transfers and access for non-essential staff and visitors.  In the current context it is of critical importance that countries work toward developing non-custodial strategies to prevent overcrowding in closed settings[10]. Governance of prison health by a ministry of health, rather than a ministry of justice or similar, is likely to facilitate this[11]."
How can programmes assure continued access to HIV services?,"It is important to assure continuous access to essential HIV prevention, testing and treatment services also where measurements of confinement are implemented within the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While access to essential services should be maintained, adapted and evidence-based measures to reduce possible transmission should be considered and implemented.  These include[12]: Applying standard precautions for all patients (including ensuring that all patients cover their nose and mouth with a tissue or elbow when coughing or sneezing, offering a medical mask to patients with suspected COVID-19 infection while they are in waiting in the service, perform hand hygiene etc.) Health care and outreach      workers, as well as peer educators and clients should apply adapted hand      hygiene measuresEnsuring triage, early      recognition, and source control (isolating patients with suspected      COVID-19 infection)Ensure there is adequate      ventilation in all areas in the healthcare facilitySpatial separation of at least      1 metre should ideally be maintained between all patients within all types      of servicesCleaning and disinfection      procedures should be followed consistently and correctlyDispensing medicines (for treatment of HIV, TB and      other chronic conditions such as opioid dependence) for longer periods      allowing reduced frequency of patient visits Consider reduction of services to the most critical      ones (provision of essential treatment and prevention services; services      such as counselling sessions may be reduced or adapted)Generally, vulnerable populations, including members of key populations, as well as homeless and/or displaced people may be at increased risk of infection – because of additional comorbidities impacting on their immune system, reduced ability to apply measures of confinement and social distancing, as well as generally limited access to health services.  It is critical that services that reach these populations such as community-based services, drop-in centres and outreach services can continue providing life-saving prevention (distribution of condoms, needles and syringes), testing and treatment while securing safety of staff and clients. Services can be adapted according to above considerations where applicable."
How can workplaces plan for the prevention and mitigation of COVID-19?,"Workplaces should develop action plans to prevent and mitigate COVID-19 as part of the business continuity plan and according to the results of the risk assessments and the epidemiological situation. The action plan and preventive measures should be regularly monitored and updated. Workers and their representatives should be consulted and should participate in the development, monitoring and updating of the workplace COVID-19. It is very important to monitor the effectiveness of preventive measures, and the compliance of workers, visitors, customers, clients and sub-contractors with the measures. The plans should be updated when someone with known or suspected COVID-19 is at the workplace."
Can the return to the workplace be immediate after public measures are lifted?,"The return to work premises should be carefully planned ahead, with preventive measures put in place according to the risk assessment of the different jobs and work tasks. All possible risks for safety and health should be assessed, such as risks resulting from reduced maintenance of machines and facilities during the closure period.  If a return to work is rushed and not done in a phased and cautious manner, it puts lives at risk, and threatens to undermine efforts to restore social and economic activity."
Does WHO recommend thermal testing of people entering a workplace?,"Temperature screening cannot detect all cases of COVID-19, since infected individuals may not have fever early in the course of infection or illness, such as during the incubation period or just before other symptoms begin, even though they may already be infectious. Some people may reduce fever with a fever-reducing medication if they are concerned about the possible consequences of not coming to work. Relying on temperature screening alone will not stop the spread of COVID-19 at work. Thermal screening at the workplace can be considered part of a package of measures to prevent and control COVID-19 at the workplace. Workers should be encouraged to self-monitor their health, possibly with the use of questionnaires, and take their own temperature regularly at home. Workplaces should adopt “stay at home if unwell” and flexible sick leave policies to discourage workers with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 from coming to the workplaces."
"Does WHO recommend workers wear masks at the workplace (office or others)? If yes, what type of masks?","Wearing masks depends on the risk assessment. For jobs and tasks that carry a medium or high risk, for people aged 60 and older, and for those with underlying health conditions, a medical mask and other personal protective equipment should be provided. Fabric masks or face coverings are currently recommended for younger people and those with no symptoms where physical distancing is not achievable. This prevents the spread of virus from the wearer (who could have COVID-19 but no symptoms) to others. The policy on wearing a mask or face covering in low risk workplaces should be in line with national or local guidelines. Masks may carry some risks if not used properly."
Are there any directives on office ventilation and air conditioning use?,"There should be fresh, clean air in all workplaces. For jobs and work tasks at medium or high risk of exposure, WHO recommends an increased ventilation rate through natural aeration or artificial ventilation, preferably without re-circulation of the air. In case of air recirculation, filters should be cleaned regularly."
What mental health and psychosocial support should be provided to workers during COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is associated with a range of concerns, such as fear of falling ill and dying, of being socially excluded, placed in quarantine, or losing a livelihood. Symptoms of anxiety and depression are common reactions for people in the context of COVID-19. Mental health and psychosocial support should be made available to all workers. Comprehensive risk assessments can help identify and mitigate related occupational hazards for mental healthFull Guideline Document Considerations for public health and social measures in the workplace in the context of COVID-19 is accessible at: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/considerations-for-public-health-and-social-measures-in-the-workplace-in-the-context-of-covid-19"
What is the role multi-month prescriptions and dispensing for antiretrovirals and other medicines?,"Clinically stable adults, children, adolescents and pregnant and breastfeeding women as well as members of key populations (people who inject drugs, sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender people and people living in prisons and closed settings) can benefit from simplified antiretroviral therapy delivery models which include multi-month prescriptions and dispensing (3-6 month supply) which will reduce the frequency of visits to clinical settings and ensures continuity of treatment during possible disruption of movements during the coronavirus outbreak.  Similar consideration should be given to providing people who are clinically stable on methadone or buprenorphine substitution therapy with an increased possibility for take-home medications to reduce additional burden on the health sector."
Can pregnant or postpartum women living with HIV transmit the COVID-19 virus to their unborn child or infant?,"There are few data on the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in specific populations, such as children and pregnant women[13] but findings from a small published study suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy[14].  Although no vertical transmission has been documented, transmission after birth via contact with infectious respiratory secretions is a concern. Infants born to mothers with suspected, probable, or confirmed COVID-19 should be fed according to standard infant feeding guidelines[15], while applying necessary precautions for infection prevention and control (IPC).  As with all confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, symptomatic mothers who are breastfeeding or practicing skin-to-skin contact or kangaroo mother care should practice respiratory hygiene, including during feeding (for example, use of a medical mask when near a child if the mother has respiratory symptoms), perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the child, and routinely clean and disinfect surfaces with which the symptomatic mother has been in contact[16].   Q&A on COVID-19, pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding"
Should pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV with COVID-19 and their newborns be managed differently?,"There is currently no known difference between the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 or risk of severe illness or foetal compromise for pregnant and non-pregnant women or adults of reproductive age.  Pregnant and recently pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be treated with supportive and management therapies, considering the immunologic and physiologic adaptations during and after pregnancy which may overlap with COVID-19 symptoms.  Data are limited but, until the evidence base provides clearer information, special consideration should be given to pregnant women with concomitant medical illnesses who could be infected with COVID-19. There are no reported deaths in pregnant women at time of publishing this information[17] however, COVID-19 testing of symptomatic pregnant women may need to be prioritized to enable access to specialized care.  All recently pregnant women with COVID-19 or who have recovered from COVID-19 should be provided with information and counselling on safe infant feeding and appropriate IPC measures to prevent COVID-19 virus transmission[18].With confirmed disease or under investigation, management is similar to non-pregnant women, with appropriate isolation of confirmed or under investigation.  Obstetric facilities must be notified and prepared, noting that each infant born to any mother with confirmed COVID-19 should be considered a ‘person under investigation’ and should be isolated according to the IPC guidance.  Currently, it is unknown whether newborns with COVID-19 are at increased risk for severe complications."
Can I get COVID-19 from food?,There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food or food packaging. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness and the transmission route is through person-to-person contact and through direct contact with respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
"Can the virus live on the surface of foods (including fruits and vegetables, frozen foods, pre-packaged foods)?",Coronaviruses cannot multiply in food – they need a live animal or human host to multiply and survive ( see question 10 of Questions relating to food businesses).
"How to wash fruits and vegetables? Just with water, or something else?",Washing fruit and vegetables with potable water is sufficient: it is recommended to follow the WHO 5-Keys to Safer Food.
Can the virus live on the surface of food packaging? How long? Is it necessary to disinfect?,"See question 10 of Questions relating to food businesses. It is not necessary to disinfect food packaging materials, but hands should be properly washed after handling food packages and before eating."
How long is it to cook food? To what temperature to kill the virus?,"This virus is not more resistant to heat than the usual viruses and bacteria found in food. As recommended for good hygiene practice, foods should be thoroughly cooked to at least 70°C. It is recommended to follow the WHO 5-Keys to Safer Food."
What precautions should consumers take in grocery stores?,"Consumers should maintain a safe physical distance of at least one metre from all other shoppers and staff while queuing before entering the store and while shopping in the store. If a trolley or basket is used while shopping, sanitize the handle before and after use. Hands should be sanitized before entering the store. Practice good coughing/sneezing etiquette while in the store. Avoid touching mouth, nose or eyes during shopping. Minimise direct hand contact with food by using available tongs and serving utensils. Use contactless payment rather than cash/notes (where feasible)."
Is food/grocery delivery safe?,"Yes, if the provider follows good personal and food hygiene practices. After accepting food/grocery deliveries, hands should be washed with soap and water."
"Can I get COVID-19 from eating fresh foods, like fruits and vegetables?","There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food, including fruits and vegetables. Fresh fruits and vegetables are part of a healthy diet and their consumption should be encouraged.  Read more in the COVID-19 and food safety: guidance for food businesses."
How should I wash fruits and vegetables in the time of COVID-19?,"Wash fruit and vegetables the same way you would in any other circumstance. Before handling them, wash your hands with soap and water. Then wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water, especially if you eat them raw."
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 live on the surface of food packaging?,"Coronaviruses need a live animal or human host to multiply and survive and cannot multiply on the surface of food packages. It is not necessary to disinfect food packaging materials, but hands should be properly washed after handling food packages and before eating (see question 10 of Questions relating to food businesses)."
How should imported foods from countries with high prevalence of COVID-19 be treated?,"As food has not been implicated in the transmission of COVID-19, imported food should be subjected to the same import controls as before the pandemic. See FAO guidance on risk based imported food control."
What is the best household disinfectant for surfaces?,"Regular household cleaning and disinfection products will effectively eliminate the virus from household surfaces.  For cleaning and disinfecting households with suspected or confirmed COVID19 illnesses - surface virucidal disinfectants, such as 0.05% sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and products based on ethanol (at least 70%), should be used."
Is it still safe to go to food markets? Animal markets? Wet markets?,"It should be safe provided it is possible to maintain a safe physical distance of at least one metre from all other shoppers and staff, it is possible to wash/sanitize hands, and that Good Manufacturing Practices and Good Hygienic Practices (GMP/GHP) standards are maintained in the market. For more recommendations on how to minimise the risk of transmission of emerging pathogens in wet markets, see the WHO recommendations to reduce risk of transmission of emerging pathogens from animals to humans in live animal markets or animal product markets."
"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the consumption of cooked foods, including animal products?","There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food. The virus that causes COVID-19 can be killed at temperatures similar to that of other known viruses and bacteria found in food. Foods such as meat, poultry and eggs should always be thoroughly cooked to at least 70°C. Before cooking, raw animal products should be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with cooked foods. The WHO 5-Keys to Safer Food provides further information."
Is it safe to go to grocery stores and other food markets?,"Yes, it is generally safe to go grocery shopping and to markets by following the below prevention measures:Clean your hands with sanitizer before entering the store.Cover a cough or sneeze in your bent elbow or tissue. Maintain at least a 1-metre distance from others, and if you can’t maintain this distance, wear a mask (many stores now require a mask).Once home, wash your hands thoroughly and also after handling and storing your purchased products.  There is currently no confirmed case of COVID-19 transmitted through food or food packaging.More information on masks is available here. For more recommendations on how to minimize the risk of transmission of emerging pathogens in traditional food markets, see the WHO recommendations to reduce risk of transmission of emerging pathogens from animals to humans in live animal markets or animal product markets."
Is it safe to have groceries delivered?,"Yes, it is safe to have groceries delivered if the provider follows good personal and food hygiene practices. After accepting food/grocery deliveries, hands should be properly washed."
What is the best household disinfectant for surfaces?,"Regular household cleaning and disinfection products will effectively eliminate the virus from household surfaces.  For cleaning and disinfecting households with suspected or confirmed COVID19, surface virucidal disinfectants, such as 0.05% sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and products based on ethanol (at least 70%), should be used."
What foods should be consumed to support the immune system?,"The immune system requires the support of many nutrients. It is recommended to consume a variety of foods for a healthy and balanced diet, including whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits, nuts and animal source foods. There is no single food that will prevent you from catching COVID-19.  For more information on a healthy diet, see the Healthy diet fact sheet."
Can micronutrient (vitamin and mineral) supplements prevent COVID-19 in healthy individuals or cure it in those with COVID-19 disease?,"No. There is currently no guidance on micronutrient supplementation for the prevention of COVID-19 in healthy individuals or for the treatment of COVID-19. Micronutrients are critical for a well-functioning immune system and play a vital role in promoting health and nutritional well-being. Wherever possible, micronutrient intakes should come from a nutritionally balanced and diverse diet, including from fruits, vegetables and animal source foods."
Are vitamin D supplements needed if individuals are not exposed to sunlight due to lockdowns?,"Vitamin D can be made in the skin by exposure to sunlight or obtained through the diet from natural sources (e.g. fatty fishes such as salmon, tuna and mackerel, fish liver oils, beef liver, cheese and egg yolks), or from vitamin D-fortified foods or vitamin D-containing supplements. In situations where individuals’ vitamin D status is already marginal or where foods rich in vitamin D (including vitamin D-fortified foods) are not consumed, and exposure to sunlight is limited, a vitamin D supplement in doses of the recommended nutrient intakes (200-600 IU, depending on age) or according to national guidelines may be considered.See WHO guidance on Vitamin and mineral requirements in human nutrition."
Are there any herbal teas or herbal supplements that may help prevent or cure COVID-19?,No. There is currently no evidence to support the use of herbal teas or herbal supplements to prevent or cure COVID-19.
Can probiotics help prevent COVID-19?,"No. Probiotics are live microorganisms that are generally added to foods or used as a supplement to the diet to confer a health benefit. However, there is currently no evidence to support the use of probiotics to help prevent or cure COVID-19."
Can eating ginger help prevent COVID-19?,"No. There is no evidence that eating ginger has protected people from COVID-19. However, ginger is a food that may have some antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties."
Can eating garlic help prevent COVID-19?,"No. There is no evidence that eating garlic has protected people from COVID-19. However, garlic is a food that may have some antimicrobial properties."
Can adding pepper to your soup or other meals help prevent or cure COVID-19?,No. There is no evidence that adding hot peppers to your food can prevent or cure COVID-19.
Do food inspectors need to wear any protective equipment?,"In the course of conducting a food inspection, food inspectors routinely wear protective equipment. There is no need for additional protective equipment to be used. The primary focus of the additional hygiene and sanitation measures implemented by food businesses should be on keeping the COVID-19 out of their businesses. COVID-19 virus will only enter business premises when an infected person enters, or contaminated fomites are brought into the premises. Food safety authorities should consider reducing the frequency of food inspections during this pandemic. If food inspectors continue to carry out food inspections, they will need to demonstrate that they are free from infection, they will need to practice physical distancing while in the food premises, changing clothes/shoes between inspections, washing hands before and after entering the food premises and good coughing/sneezing etiquette."
What do food inspectors need to consider when reopening a food business when the pandemic is over?,Food inspectors do not need to intervene when restaurants reopen after having closed upon the advice of national governments.
What are the lab protocols for identifying the virus in food? On surfaces?,"As food has not been implicated in the transmission of COVID-19, testing of food or food surfaces for this virus is not recommended. Frequent cleaning of food contact surfaces with virucidal disinfectants such as 0.05% sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) or products based on ethanol (at least 70%) should be carried out. Alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2, in concentrations of 70-80% with one-minute exposure time. Chlorine-based disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite) are effective for surface decontamination, as are disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS)."
Is quarantine necessary for live animals imported from countries experiencing a large numbers of COVID-19 cases?,"No, food animals have not been implicated in the transmission of COVID-19 and the same import controls should apply as before this pandemic. See Q&A from the World Organisation for Animal Health for more about COVID-19 and animals."
How do we ensure the food supply chain remains intact to prevent food shortages?,"While many businesses have introduced working from home and teleworking, these are not options for food workers who are required to continue to work as normal. Keeping all workers in the food production and supply chains healthy and safe is critical to avoid food shortage. Maintaining the movement of food along the food chain is an essential function of all sectors of the food industry and is extremely important for ensuring consumer confidence in the food supply. In order to ensure that the food supply chain remains intact to prevent food shortages there is an urgent requirement for the industry to introduce additional measures to protect food workers from contracting COVID-19; to prevent the risk of exposure to COVID-19, and to strengthen existing food hygiene and sanitation practices."
How can food businesses remain safe from virus contamination?,"The main priority is to keep the virus out of the food environment. Several key measures are required including upgrading of cleaning and sanitation measures, disinfecting surfaces and high-touch points, educating staff on the virus and how to protect themselves and others, reinforcing protocols such as physical distancing, hand washing, and improved security with people staying in their vehicles/sanitizing hands when handing out documents and other material."
Should grocery store workers wear gloves? Masks?,"Disposable GlovesGloves may be used by food workers but must be changed frequently and hands must be washed between glove changes and when gloves are removed. Gloves must be changed after carrying out non-food related activities such as opening/closing doors by hand, and emptying bins. Food workers should be aware that wearing gloves can allow bacteria to build up on the surface of the hands, so hand washing is extremely important when gloves are removed to avoid subsequent contamination of food. Food workers should not touch their mouth, nose and eyes when wearing gloves.Disposable gloves can give a false sense of safety and should not be used in the food work environment as a substitute for hand washing. The COVID-19 virus can contaminate disposable gloves in the same way it can get onto workers hands and contact surfaces. Removal of disposable gloves can lead to contamination of hands. Wearing disposable gloves can give you a false sense of security and may result in staff not washing hands as frequently as required.Handwashing is a greater protective barrier to infection than wearing of disposable gloves. Food businesses need to ensure adequate sanitary facilities are provided and ensure food workers thoroughly and frequently wash their hands. Soap and water is adequate for hand washing. Hand sanitisers can be used as an additional measure but should not replace hand washing.Wearing of Face MasksWHO advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19 should be followed. Face Masks do not have to be routinely used by food workers to protect against transmission of COVID-19. However, for some food processing activities, such as working in abattoirs or handling cooked, ready-to-eat foods, wearing face masks is a usual practice.WHO recommends that face masks should be used if a person is sick with symptoms of COVID-19 (especially coughing) or looking after someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.However, a food worker who is sick or who has symptoms of COVID-19 should not be allowed to work in grocery stores or other food businesses and should be excluded from work until free of symptoms or deemed fit for work by a medical doctor."
What is dexamethasone and does it work against COVID-19?,"Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid used in a wide range of conditions for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects.It was tested in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the United Kingdom’s national clinical trial RECOVERY and was found to have benefits for critically ill patients.According to preliminary findings shared with WHO (and now available as a preprint), for patients on ventilators, the treatment was shown to reduce mortality by about one third, and for patients requiring only oxygen, mortality was cut by about one fifth."
Were all patients in RECOVERY given dexamethasone?,"Eligible patients were randomly allocated between several treatment arms. Dexamethasone was administered as an oral (liquid or tablets) or intravenous preparation, at a dose of 6 mg once daily for ten days, in one of the arms.In pregnancy or breastfeeding women, patients were randomized to prednisolone (a milder corticosteroid) 40 mg administered by mouth."
Does WHO recommend the use of dexamethasone for COVID-19 patients?,"On 2 September 2020, WHO issued an interim guideline on the use of dexamethasone and other corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19. The guidelines were developed by a panel of WHO and international experts and investigators and is based on evidence collected from seven clinical trials.


The guidelines make two recommendations:


Recommendation 1:


WHO strongly recommends that corticosteroids (i.e. dexamethasone, hydrocortisone or prednisone) be given orally or intravenously for the treatment of patients with severe and critical COVID-19.


Recommendation 2:


WHO advises against the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with non-severe COVID-19, unless the patient is already taking this medication for another condition.


Time and duration of medication should be once daily for 7-10 days.


Daily dose should be 6 mg of dexamethasone, equivalent to 160 mg of hydrocortisone (i.e. 50 mg every 8 hours or 100 mg every 12 hours), 40 mg of prednisone, 32 mg of methylprednisolone (8 mg every 6 hours).


The panel of experts made its recommendation on the basis of the moderate certainty evidence of a mortality reduction of 8.7% and 6.7% in patients with COVID-19 who are critically or severely ill."
Is dexamethasone on the WHO Essential Medicines List?,"Yes, dexamethasone has been on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) since 1977 for several indications in multiple formulations. Since 2013, dexamethasone (Injectable formulation) has been indicated for respiratory distress syndrome in new-borns. Prednisolone is also on the EML and was included in 1984.Dexamethasone and prednisolone are included on the EML for the following indications:allergic or hypersensitivity conditions, without further specifying the typepain and oedema due to malignancy in palliative carenausea and vomiting,as part of treatment protocols for some blood tissue cancers.These indications are broad and can also include cytokine-related lung injury and as prevention or treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe acute respiratory infections (i.e. viral pneumonia). Both medicines are also recommended in children."
Is dexamethasone prequalified by WHO?,"Yes, dexamethasone solution for injection 4mg/ml in 1ml ampoules, manufactured by Kern Pharma SL, Spain, has been prequalified for its use in the management of diseases associated with HIV/AIDS, but not for COVID-19.Another dexamethasone injection product is currently under assessment.Manufacturers interested in prequalifying their product can contact the Prequalification Team at [email protected]  for further information."
What dose was used in the Recovery trial?,"Dexamethasone was used in the Recovery Trial in oral (liquid or tablets) or intravenous preparation 6 mg once daily for ten days.In pregnancy or breastfeeding women, prednisolone 40 mg administered by mouth (or intravenous hydrocortisone 80 mg twice daily) should be used instead of dexamethasone.Note: It is permitted to switch between the two routes of administration according to clinical circumstances.Source: Page 9 of 35 RECOVERY [V6.0 2020-05-14] ISRCTN50189673 EudraCT 2020-001113-21"
Is contraception/ family planning safe to use during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Yes. All modern methods of contraception are safe to use, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  


If you have had a baby in the last six months or have a health condition, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or breast cancer – or if you smoke – seek advice from a health care professional to ensure you are using a method of contraception which is suitable and safe for you."
I want to avoid getting pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic. What can I do?,"If you do not want to become pregnant, you should start or continue to use your contraceptive method of choice. You may be able to access information and contraceptive services from a healthcare provider by phone or online.  If you cannot access these services you may opt for a method that is available without a prescription (such as condoms, spermicides, pills, or emergency contraceptive pills) from a nearby pharmacy or drug shop."
I can’t access my contraceptive method of choice. What do you advise?,"If you cannot access your contraceptive method of choice – perhaps because it requires a prescription, or because it can only be given to you by a health worker – consider using condoms, fertility awareness-based methods, lactational amenorrhea (if you are exclusively breastfeeding), or other contraceptive methods that are recommended for self-care in your country.  


Depending on the situation in your country, methods recommended for self-care could include the pill or mini-pill, emergency contraception pills, and DMPA-SC (Sayana Press®)."
What is the best contraceptive method to use during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"All modern methods of contraception help to prevent pregnancy. Women and their partners can choose any modern contraceptive method that is acceptable to and safe for them. The best method of contraception is the one that works well for you.
There is a wide variety of modern methods, one of which may suit you best. For more information see here. 
Condoms, when they are used consistently and correctly, are the only method of contraception that help to prevent unintended pregnancy and protect against sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.  They can be used together with other methods of contraception to protect against both unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.
Emergency contraceptive pills can prevent up to 95% of pregnancies when taken within 5 days after intercourse, and they can be taken by anyone with or without a health condition"
I want to change my contraceptive method – is this possible?,"Yes. It may be difficult however, to access all the methods of contraception that are normally available in your country due to restrictions on movement, lack of supply, as well as increased demands on health providers and services.  


If you have a pre-existing health condition, consult a provider to find out what options suit you best, and which are available and feasible. Seek advice and information from your health provider and consider using methods that do not have medical restrictions like minipills, condoms, fertility awareness-based methods, diaphragm, spermicides or lactational amenorrhea if you are exclusively breastfeeding."
I want to remove or replace my implant or IUD – can I do this during COVID-19 pandemic?,"Removal of long acting methods such as implants or IUDs, after the recommended period of use (and routine follow up appointments) may not be prioritized by your country’s health system during this health emergency. Seek advice from your health provider. If you are experiencing side effects or desire urgent removal for other reasons, contact a provider to find out what options suit you best, and which are available and feasible. If, due to restrictions on movement due to the COVID-19 pandemic you cannot have your long acting method removed straight away, it is important to use another method of contraception to avoid pregnancy at this time.   There are no medical problems caused by delaying removal of long acting methods such as implants or IUDs. Do not try to remove the contraception method yourself; wait until you are able to access health care from a trained provider."
"Why is providing contraception/ family planning, as well as family planning services and information, important during the COVID-19 pandemic?","Contraception and family planning information and services are life-saving and important at all times. Sexual activity does not cease with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is therefore crucial to ensure that people are able to access rights-based services and information to initiate and / or continue use of contraception. By preventing unintended pregnancies, contraception helps to protect girls and women from the negative health consequences of unintended pregnancies, which can save their lives. Contraception reduces the need for abortion, meaning that women and girls are less at risk of unsafe abortion, which again can be lifesaving.  Condoms, when used consistently and correctly, help to prevent both unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV).  In addition, by preventing the negative health consequences associated with unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV), contraception can help alleviate additional pressure on already-stretched health systems which are working hard to address COVID-19."
What is the protocol when an employee working in a food business becomes ill with COVID-19?,"Staff who are feeling unwell should not report to work and should seek medical advice. However, in the event that a food worker becomes unwell in the workplace with typical symptoms of COVID-19, they should be removed to an area away from other people.
    If possible, find a room or area where they can be isolated behind a closed door, such as a staff office. If it is possible to open a window, do so for ventilation. Arrangements should be made for the unwell employee to be removed quickly from the
    food premise.The employee who is unwell should follow national guidelines for reporting cases/suspect cases of COVID-19. Whilst they wait for medical advice or to be sent home, they should avoid any contact with other employees. They should avoid touching people,
    surfaces and objects and be advised to cover their mouth and nose with a disposable tissue when they cough or sneeze and put the tissue in a bag or pocket and then dispose of the tissue in a bin. If they do not have any tissues available, they should
    cough and sneeze into the crook of their elbow. If they need to go to the bathroom whilst waiting for medical assistance, they should use a separate bathroom, if available.All surfaces that the infected employee has come into contact with must be cleaned. Alcohol based sanitizers/surface disinfectants should be used for cleaning purposes. In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been
    shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like COVID-19 virus, in concentrations of 70-80%. Common disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS) and chlorine would also have virucidal properties.
    All staff should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with soap and water after any contact with someone who is unwell with symptoms consistent with coronavirus infection.If an employee is confirmed as a case of COVID-19 it will be necessary to notify all close contacts of the infected employee so they too can take measures to minimise further risk of spread. WHO definitions of a contact of a COVID-19 case can be found 
    here. Examples of contacts in the food businesses could include any employee who was in face-to-face or physical (i.e., touching) contact; any employee who was within 1 meter with the confirmed case; anyone who has cleaned up any bodily fluids
        without adequate PPE (e.g. gloves, overalls, protective clothing); employees in the same working team or workgroup as the confirmed case, and any employee living in the same household as a confirmed case.WHO recommends that contacts be quarantined for 14 days from the last point of exposure to the confirmed case.22 At a minimum, staff who have had
    close contact with the infected employee should be asked to stay at home for 14 days from the last time they had contact with the confirmed case and practice physical distancing. If they become unwell at any time within their 14-day isolation period
    and they test positive for COVID-19, they will become a confirmed case, and should be managed as such.Staff who have not had close contact with the original confirmed case should continue taking the usual precautions and attend work as usual. Organising employees into small teams or workgroups will help to minimise disruption to work processes in the event of an employee reporting sick with symptoms of COVID-19. Closure of the workplace is not recommended.More detailed information can be found in COVID-19 and food safety: guidance for food businesses.For more information on contacts of COVID-19 confirmed cases, see WHO guidance on surveillance and case definitions."
What are the typical side effects of dexamethasone?,"Dexamethasone is generally safe. It presents a favourable benefit-risk profile, particularly in patients with severe forms of pneumonia, while the benefit is less prominent in patients with non-severe pneumonia. As the treatment is short, even at high doses, corticosteroids are not associated with serious side effects. Potentially higher blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) are temporary.Prolonged use (I.e., used for more than two weeks) may be associated with adverse events such as glaucoma, cataract, fluid retention, hypertension, psychological effects (e.g., mood swings, memory issues, confusion or irritation), weight gain, or increased risk of infections and osteoporosis.To reiterate: All these adverse events are not associated with short term use (with the exception of hyperglycaemia that can worsen diabetes)."
How do the doses used in the RECOVERY trial compare with those used normally?,The Recovery trial used dexamethasone 6mg daily oral or intravenous for ten days. Higher daily doses of dexamethasone have been used for other indications for a long time and are known to be safe.
Can steroids be used in the elderly/children/pregnancy?,"They can be used in children and the elderly. In pregnancy, the Recovery trial used prednisolone orally or hydrocortisone by intravenous infusion instead of dexamethasone. Steroids are ubiquitous in terms of geographic use."
Is dexamethasone available across the world?,"Yes. Dexamethasone is off-patent and has been marketed in different formulations (e.g., tablets, liquid, solution for injection) for many years. It is generally available in most countries. There are several manufacturers of the product. One manufacturer has already been prequalified by WHO (Kern Pharma in Spain) while another is under assessment.The most common formulations are:Tablets: 0.5mg, 0.75mg, 1mg, 1.5mg, 2mg, 4mg and 6mgOral Solution: 0.5mg/5ml, 20mg/5ml and 1mg/ml (concentrate) Injectable suspension: 4mg/ml, 20mg/5mlIn recent years there have been occasional reports of shortages of this product. It is important to quickly understand the projected volumes for COVID-19 utilization and manufacturing capacity to help assess the impact for existing indications and the potential need for substitute therapies, to ensure all patients retain access to a safe, effective, quality, affordable product to meet their therapeutic needs."
How many API suppliers are there?,"There are many manufacturers of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) around the world, ensuring a large and diversified capacity of production for this product. So far, we have identified ten potentially quality approved suppliers from Asia, North America, and Europe."
Is dexamethasone affordable/what is the price per treatment?,"Dexamethasone is an off-patent, common supportive treatment option and is generally affordable. WHO 2016 and 2019 surveys of different health facilities in low- and middle-income countries indicate that dexamethasone was available to patients at a median price of $0.33 per 4mg/ml injection ampoules (range: US$0.13-$3.5). Major UN procurers may be able to supply dexamethasone for a median price of $0.092 per 4mg/ml injection ampoule."
Are there any import restrictions?,"There are likely no restrictions, as dexamethasone is authorized worldwide."
What are the risks of Substandard or Falsified (SF) products?,"There are 21 records of falsified dexamethasone in the WHO Global Surveillance and Monitoring System database with the most recent one received from the Eastern Mediterranean in February 2020.It is expected that, following the high level of publicity given to the medicines, incidents of substandard and/or falsified dexamethasone products will occur. This is based on experience with reports of falsified chloroquine products when hydroxychloroquine was thought to be a potential treatment for COVID19Increased vigilance throughout all supply chains and due diligence in any procurement activities are essential. Member States and regulatory authorities are encouraged to promptly report any incidents of substandard or falsified dexamethasone to the WHO global surveillance and monitoring system."
I am a policy maker. What can I do to make sure people can access contraception and family planning information and services?,"Plan and develop innovative strategies to ensure as many eligible people as possible can access information and contraception during this period. 


Increase use of mobile phones and digital technologies to help people make decisions about which contraceptive methods to use, and how they can be accessed.  


Enable health care workers to provide contraceptive information and services as per national guidelines to the full extent possible.  This is particularly important where pregnancy poses a high risk to health.   


Expand availability of contraceptive services (including both information and methods) through places other than healthcare facilities, such as pharmacies, drug shops, online platforms and other outlets.  This can be with or without prescription depending on national guidelines and contraceptive method.   


Relax restrictions on the number of repeat issues of prescription-only hormonal contraceptives that can be issued. 


Ensure access to emergency post-coital contraception, including consideration of over the counter provision. 


Enable access to contraception for women and girls in the immediate post-partum and post abortion periods when they may access health services."
I am a programme manager. What can I do to help people access contraception and family planning information and services?,"Increase use of telehealth for counselling and sharing of messages related to safe and effective use of contraception and for selection and initiation of contraceptives. 


Ensure adequate inventory to avoid potential stock outs at all levels of the health system. 


Prepare advisories for users on how they can access contraceptive information, services and supplies. 


Monitor contraceptive consumption in your area to identify any potential pitfall and shortage.


Increase availability and access to the contraceptives which can be used by the client without service provider support."
When can an employee return to work following illness? Are temperature checks appropriate?,"A return to work policy for staff who have been infected and recovered from COVID-19 should be in place. WHO recommends that a confirmed patient could be released from isolation once their symptoms resolve and they have two negative PCR tests at least 24 hours apart.  If testing is not possible, WHO recommends that a confirmed patient can be released from isolation 14 days after symptoms resolve. Taking the temperature of food workers is not recommended. Fever is only one of the symptoms of COVID-19 and absence of fever alone is not a reliable indicator of wellness. As part of a food business ‘fitness to work’ guidelines, staff should report to management if they are sick with typical COVID-19 symptoms, particularly fever."
What specific precautions do food workers need to take?,"Physical distancing, good personal hygiene with frequent hand washing, and application of general food hygiene measures are the most important precautions food workers should adopt. Physical distancing is very important to help slow the spread of coronavirus. This is achieved by minimising contact between potentially infected individuals and healthy individuals. Frequent hand washing with soap and water and use of hand sanitizers are also important in reducing the risk of transmission. All food businesses should follow the physical distancing and hand washing guidance of WHO.The Codex Alimentarius Commission has adopted several practical guidelines on how to apply and implement best practices to ensure food hygiene (Codex General Principles of Food Hygiene, CXC 1- 1969), handle meats (Codex Code of Hygienic Practice for Meat, CXC 58 – 2005), and control viruses in foods (Guidelines for the Application of General Principles of Food Hygiene to the Control of Viruses in Food (CAC/GL 79-2012). Enhanced food safety practices at this time, such as those recommended in the Codex documents mentioned, will reduce the likelihood of contamination of foods with any pathogen and help lowering the public health burden caused by already established foodborne infections, reducing the stress on an already overburdened public health system."
How should employees maintain safe distance from one another during food production and processing?,"WHO guidelines are to maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) between fellow workers. Where the food production environment makes it difficult to do so, employers need to consider what measures to put in place to protect employees. Examples of practical measures to adhere to physical distancing guidance in the food processing environment are to:stagger workstations on either side of processing lines so that food workers are not facing one another,provide personal protection equipment (PPE) such as face masks, hair nets, disposable gloves, clean overalls and slip reduction work shoes for staff. The use of PPE would be routine in high risk areas of food premises that produce ready-to-eat and cooked foods. When staff are dressed in PPE it is possible to reduce distance between workers,space out workstations, which may require reduction in the speed of production lines,limit the number of staff in a food preparation area at any one time,organise staff into working groups or teams to facilitate reduced interaction between groups, including during change of work shifts."
How should baked goods and fresh produce be displayed in a food market/grocery store?,"It is important to maintain good hygiene practices around open food displays, with ready-to-eat food products such as salad bars, fresh produce displays and bakery products. Consumers should always be advised to wash fruits and vegetables with potable water prior to consumption. Both customers and staff should strictly observe good personal hygiene practices at all times around open food areas.In order to hygienically manage open food displays and to avoid the transmission of COVID-19 through surface contact, food retailers should:Maintain frequent washing and sanitising of all food contact surfaces and utensils;Require food service workers to frequently wash hands, and, if using gloves, these must be changed;Require food service workers to frequently clean and sanitise counters, serving utensils and condiment containers;Make available hand sanitiser for consumers on their way in and out of the food premises;Should consider not openly displaying or selling unwrapped bakery products from self-service counters. Bakery products on open, self-service displays in retail stores should be placed in plastic/cellophane or paper packaging. Where loose bakery products are displayed in retail stores, these should be placed in plexiglass display cabinets and placed in bags using tongs when customers are served.Ready-to-eat salads available in retail for self-serve, should also be placed behind plexiglass display cabinets and serving utensils should be frequently sanitized."
What is the worldwide production capacity?,Work is ongoing to determine producers of licensed and quality assured products. Further assessments of additional production capacity will be undertaken.
What areas should be prioritized for disinfection in non-health care settings?,"Disinfection practices are important to reduce the potential for COVID-19 virus contamination in non-healthcare settings, such as in the home, office, schools, gyms, publicly accessible buildings, faith-based community centres, markets, transportation and business settings or restaurants. High-touch surfaces in these non-health care settings should be identified for priority disinfection such as door and window handles, kitchen and food preparation areas, counter tops, bathroom surfaces, toilets and taps, touchscreen personal devices, personal computer keyboards, and work surfaces."
Which surface disinfectants are effective against COVID-19 in non-health care setting environments?,"In non-health care settings, sodium hypochlorite (bleach / chlorine) may be used at a recommended concentration of 0.1% or 1,000ppm (1 part of 5% strength household bleach to 49 parts of water). Alcohol at 70-90% can also be used for surface disinfection. Surfaces must be cleaned with water and soap or a detergent first to remove dirt, followed by disinfection.  Cleaning should always start from the least soiled (cleanest) area to the most soiled (dirtiest) area in order to not spread the dirty to areas that are less soiled. All disinfectant solutions should be stored in opaque containers, in a well-ventilated, covered area that is not exposed to direct sunlight and ideally should be freshly prepared every day.In indoor spaces, routine application of disinfectants to surfaces via spraying is not recommended for COVID-19. If disinfectants are to be applied, these should be via a cloth or wipe which is soaked in the disinfectant."
What protection measures should people take when using disinfectants?,"It is important to reduce your risk when using disinfectants:The disinfectant and its concentration should be carefully selected to avoid damaging surfaces and to avoid or minimize toxic effects on household members (or users of public spaces).Avoid combining disinfectants, such as bleach and ammonia, since mixtures can cause respiratory irritation and release potentially fatal gases.Keep children, pets and other people away during the application of the product until it is dry and there is no odour. Open windows and use fans to ventilate. Step away from odours if they become too strong. Disinfectant solutions should always be prepared in well-ventilated areas.Wash your hands after using any disinfectant, including surface wipes. Keep lids tightly closed when not in use. Spills and accidents are more likely to happen when containers are open. Do not allow children to use disinfectant wipes. Keep cleaning fluids and disinfectants out of the reach of children and pets. Throw away disposable items like gloves and masks if they are used during cleaning. Do not clean and re-use.Do not use disinfectant wipes to clean hands or as baby wipes.The minimum recommended personal protective equipment when disinfecting in non-health care settings is rubber gloves, waterproof aprons and closed shoes. Eye protection and medical masks may also be needed to protect against chemicals in use or if there is a risk of splashing.Note: Where cleaning and disinfection are not possible on a regular basis due to resource limitations, frequent hand washing and avoiding touching the face should be the primary prevention approaches to reduce any potential transmission associated with surface contamination."
"What is the guidance for the disinfection of outdoor spaces such as open markets, roads?","In outdoor spaces, large-scale spraying or fumigation in areas such as streets or open market places for the COVID-19 virus or other pathogens is not recommended. Streets and sidewalks are not considered as routes of infection for COVID-19. Spraying disinfectants, even outdoors, can be noxious for people’s health and cause eye, respiratory or skin irritation or damage.This practice will be ineffective since the presence of dirt or rubbish for example, inactivates the disinfectant, and manual cleaning to physically remove all matter is not feasible. This is even less effective on porous surfaces such as sidewalks and unpaved walkways. Even in the absence of dirt or rubbish, it is unlikely that chemical spraying would adequately cover surfaces allowing the required contact time to inactivate pathogens."
Are public systems for disinfecting individuals such as spraying via tunnel or chambers safe to use?,"No. Spraying of individuals with disinfectants (such as in a tunnel, cabinet, or chamber) is not recommended under any circumstances. This practice could be physically and psychologically harmful and would not reduce an infected person’s ability to spread the virus through droplets or contact. Even if someone who is infected with COVID-19 goes through a disinfection tunnel or chamber, as soon as they start speaking, coughing or sneezing they can still spread the virus.  The toxic effect of spraying with chemicals such as chlorine on individuals can lead to eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm due to inhalation, and potentially gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting. In addition to health safety concerns, the use of chlorine in large-scale spraying practices may prevent this resource from being used for important interventions such as drinking water treatment and environmental disinfection of health care facilities."
What are the recommended practices once back home after outdoor activities?,"Thorough hand hygiene: washing hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand gel, should be performed before touching surfaces, items, pets, and people within the household environment. Please see: https://www.who.int/gpsc/clean_hands_protection/en/. While outside, people should always follow physical distancing measures, staying at least one metre from another person; perform hand hygiene by washing hands frequently with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub; follow good respiratory hygiene by covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; and avoid crowded places."
"Are gloves recommended for the community in public spaces to protect against COVID-19, for example when going to the grocery store supermarket?","No. The use of gloves by the public in public spaces is not a recommended or proven prevention measure. Wearing gloves in public spaces does not replace the need for hand hygiene, nor does it offer any additional measure of protection against the COVID-19 virus than hand hygiene. Gloves do not provide complete protection against hand contamination, as pathogens may gain access to the hands via small defects in gloves or by contamination of the hands during glove removal. People can also transfer pathogens from one surface to another by touching with gloved hands, or even transfer pathogens to the mouth, nose, or eyes if they touch their face with gloved hands."
How should shopping trolleys or carts be disinfected?,"The handles of shopping trolleys or carts should be frequently cleaned using either alcohol-based sanitizers or chlorine-based disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite). Sanitizers, paper towels and trash bins should be placed outside the retail premises close to the trolley park for customers to use."
What is the most appropriate sanitizer to use on surfaces in a food production environment?,"In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2, in concentrations of 70-80% with one-minute exposure time. Chlorine-based disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite) are effective for surface decontamination, as are disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS)."
Could the virus be transmitted from humans to food animals or vice versa?,"Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that food animals could be a possible route for transmission of COVID-19 to humans or that food animals can become infected by humans. Studies are underway to better understand the susceptibility of different animal species to the COVID-19 virus and to assess infection dynamics in susceptible animal species.

What is known about various conditions affecting survivability of the virus?,"Very little is known about how the SARS-CoV-2 virus survives outside the human body. Probably the most up-to-date summary of scientific information we have on survival in the environment is from the European Centre for Disease control (ECDC) and the following is extracted from their recent technical report:Recent publications have evaluated the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on different surfaces. According to van Doremalen et al., the environmental stability of SARS-CoV-2 is up to three hours in the air post-aerosolization, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel, albeit with significantly decreased titres [3]. These findings are comparable with results obtained for environmental stability of SARS-CoV-1. These findings resulted from experiments in a controlled environment and should be interpreted with caution in the real-life environment. Moreover, different levels of environmental contamination have been detected in rooms of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 1 out of 13 to 13 out of 15 samples testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 before cleaning. No air samples were positive in these studies, but one sample from an air exhaust outlet was positive indicating that virus particles may be displaced by air and deposited on surfaces [4,5]. In a study of environmental contamination in a Chinese hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in environmental samples from the COVID-19 dedicated intensive care units (ICU), the COVID-19 dedicated obstetric isolation ward and the COVID-19 dedicated isolation ward. SARS-CoV-2 was also detected on objects such as the self-service printers used by patients to self-print the results of their exams, desktop keyboards and doorknobs. Virus was detected most commonly on gloves (15.4% of samples) and rarely on eye protection (1.7%) [6]. This evidence shows the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment of a COVID-19 patient, therefore reinforcing the belief that fomites play a role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, the relative importance of this route of transmission compared to direct exposure to respiratory droplets is still unclear."
What measures should be taken to ensure safe transport of food during this pandemic?,"The general guidelines outlined in the Codex Code of Hygienic Practice for the Transport of Food in Bulk and Semi-Packed Food.1 should be followed, in addition to ensuring that employees delivering foods are free from COVID-19, coughing/sneezing etiquette is practiced by all involved in food transport and that frequent hand washing/sanitizing is practiced and staff practice physical distancing.See also other Codes of Hygienic Practice for various groups of food."
What measures should be taken to ensure safe water is used in food production during this pandemic?,There is no evidence that COVID-19 is transmitted by water used in food processing. The WHO guidelines for drinking-water quality should be followed.
How should food premises be cleaned/disinfected during this pandemic?,"The general guidelines outlined in the General Principles of Food Hygiene for food processing and manufacture premises should be followed. If a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 is identified in a food premises then there is a requirement to completely clean the area with a neutral detergent, followed by decontamination of surfaces using a disinfectant effective against viruses. All surfaces that the infected employee has come into contact with must be cleaned, including all surfaces and objects which are visibly contaminated with body fluids/respiratory secretions, and all potentially contaminated high-contact areas such as toilets, door handles, telephones. Alcohol based sanitizers/surface disinfectants should be used for cleaning purposes. In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2, in concentrations of 70-80% with one-minute exposure time. Chlorine-based disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite) are effective for surface decontamination, as are disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS).All staff should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds after any contact with someone who is unwell with symptoms consistent with coronavirus infection. Staff engaged in environmental cleaning should wear PPE when performing cleaning activities, such as overalls or uniform, single-use plastic aprons, gloves and a face mask. Protective clothing (e.g. uniforms, overalls, etc.) should be frequently washed at 60°C or above."
"How should I clean food items from the grocery store, for example fruit, vegetables or packaged items?","There is no evidence to date of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses being transmitted via food or food packaging. Coronaviruses cannot multiply in food; they need an animal or human host to multiply.The COVID-19 virus is generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of the COVID-19 virus associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 40-60 seconds. Regular food safety and handling guidance should be followed.See: https://www.who.int/activities/promoting-safe-food-handling. For food service businesses, please see the below guidance on COVID-19 and Food Safety: https://www.who.int/teams/risk-communication/food-and-agriculture-sectors."
Should children wear a mask?,"WHO advises that people always consult and abide by local authorities on recommended practices in their area. An international and multidisciplinary expert group brought together by WHO reviewed evidence on COVID-19 disease and transmission in children and the limited available evidence on the use of masks by children. Based on this and other factors such as childrens’ psychosocial needs and developmental milestones, WHO and UNICEF advise the following: Children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks. This is based on the safety and overall interest of the child and the capacity to appropriately use a mask with minimal assistance. WHO and UNICEF advise that the decision to use masks for children aged 6-11 should be based on the following factors:Whether there is widespread transmission in the area where the child residesThe ability of the child to safely and appropriately use a maskAccess to masks, as well as laundering and replacement of masks in certain settings (such as schools and childcare services) Adequate adult supervision and instructions to the child on how to put on, take off and safely wear masksPotential impact of wearing a mask on learning and psychosocial development, in consultation with teachers, parents/caregivers and/or medical providersSpecific settings and interactions the child has with other people who are at high risk of developing serious illness, such as the elderly and those with other underlying health conditions WHO and UNICEF advise that children aged 12 and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area.More on the types of masks, how to choose them, and how to wear them is available here:  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks"
Where can I find the latest information on COVID-19?,"For the latest information on COVID-19, check regularly on the WHO’s coronavirus pages: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019"
Do weather and climate determine where COVID-19 occurs?,"No. There is currently no conclusive evidence that either weather (short term variations in meteorological conditions) or climate (long-term averages) have a strong influence on transmission. The SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes COVID-19 disease has been transmitted in all regions of the world, from cold and dry, to hot and humid climates.SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be mainly transmitted directly from person-to-person through close contact, or through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. People may be infected by touching exposed surfaces, but this is not thought to be a major transmission route. While temperature and humidity may influence how long the virus survives outside of the human body, this effect is likely to be small compared to the degree of contact between people.Physical distancing and washing hands are therefore essential to breaking the chain of transmission, and are the most effective way to protect yourself, in all locations and all seasons of the year."
What is contact tracing?,"Contact tracing is the process of identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to a disease to prevent onward transmission. These people are called contacts. Contact tracing for COVID-19 requires identifying people who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and following them daily for 14 days. The goal is to stop transmission of the virus by reducing the number of people who are circulating with the virus."
How does contact tracing work?,"Contact tracing is a process that includes several steps:Defining contacts: a contact is a person who has been exposed to someone else infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, from 2 days before to 14 days after the person started to show symptoms. Identifying contacts: this is done through an interview with the person infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 to find out who they have been in contact with.Informing contacts: each contact should be contacted by phone or in person to determine if they meet the definition and then be monitored. Each person confirmed as a contact should be informed about the goal of contact tracing, the process (including how their personal data will be protected) and who to contact with any concerns or questions. Additional essential information should be provided on how and when to quarantine, symptoms to look for, and what to do if the person becomes unwell. Managing and monitoring contacts daily: the contact person identified should be encouraged and supported to stay in quarantine, which means to separate from others in order to limit the possibility of exposing other people to infection should they become ill. During the quarantine period, daily monitoring should be implemented to monitor their health for any sign of illness. The monitoring ends 14 days after the person was last in contact with the person infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.Data processes and analysis: The information on each contact person is gathered in a database and updated daily monitoring on the person’s health status. These processes vary from country to country. See question What should be considered for data protection?"
Who is defined as a contact?,"A contact is defined as anyone who had direct contact or was within 1 metre for at least 15 minutes with a person infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, even if the person with the confirmed infection did not have symptoms. Contacts should remain in self-quarantine during the 14-day monitoring period to limit the possibility of exposing other people to infection should they become ill."
Can contact tracing help in controlling spread of the virus?,"Yes, when systematically applied, contact tracing will break the chains of transmission, meaning that the virus transmission can be stopped. Contact tracing is thus an essential public health tool for controlling infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19."
When should contact tracing be implemented?,"Comprehensive contact tracing should be implemented as soon as cases or clusters are identified. During intense transmission, contact tracing may be difficult but should be carried out as much as possible, focusing on vulnerable and household contacts, healthcare workers and high-risk closed settings (e.g., dormitories, institutions, long-term care homes and other long-term facilities). When countries have passed a peak in transmission and the numbers of sick people are decreasing, particularly when stringent public health and social measures are being adjusted, it is critical to maintain rapid identification of sick people and contact tracing. This identification and investigation break new transmission chains."
What happens if you are a contact?,"If you are a possible contact, you should first be contacted by phone or in person by health authorities to determine if you meet the contact definition, which is anyone who has had direct contact or was within 1 metre for at least 15 minutes with a person infected with COVID-19. If you are confirmed as a contact, you will then be encouraged and supported to be in quarantine, which means to separate yourself from others, and to monitor your health for any signs of illness. The monitoring ends 14 days you were last into contact with the person infected with COVID-19.By participating in contact tracing, you are contributing to controlling spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 in your area; vulnerable people will be protected, and more restrictive measures, such as general stay-at-home orders, might be avoided or minimized. This is an act of solidarity for your community."
Who is needed for successful contact tracing?,"Everyone is needed for successful contact tracing and contact tracing begins with engaged communities. It requires individuals to agree to daily monitoring, to be willing to report signs or symptoms of COVID-19 promptly, and be prepared to go into quarantine for at least 14 days, or into isolation if they become symptomatic. Transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 can only be stopped if we all play our role to protect our family, friends and community.Contact tracing is only possible with contact tracers trained in the basics of virus transmission, prevention and control measures, how to monitor signs and symptoms, as well as the ethics of public health surveillance and quarantine. Ideally, contact tracers are recruited from their own community, including local government, civil society and non-governmental organizations, university students and community volunteers."
Are there situations where children aged 5 years and under may wear or be required to wear a mask?,"In general, children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks. This advice is based on the safety and overall interest of the child and the capacity to appropriately use a mask with minimal assistance. There may be local requirements for children aged 5 years and under to wear masks, or specific needs in some settings, such as being physically close to someone who is ill. In these circumstances, if the child wears a mask, a parent or other guardian should be within direct line of sight to supervise the safe use of the mask."
Will climate change make COVID-19 worse?,"There is no evidence of a direct connection between climate change and the emergence or transmission of COVID-19 disease. As the disease is now well established in the human population, efforts should focus on reducing transmission and treating patients.However, climate change may indirectly affect the COVID-19 response, as it undermines environmental determinants of health, and places additional stress on health systems. More generally, most emerging infectious diseases, and almost all recent pandemics, originate in wildlife, and there is evidence that increasing human pressure on the natural environment may drive disease emergence. Strengthening health systems, improved surveillance of infectious disease in wildlife, livestock and humans, and greater protection of biodiversity and the natural environment, should reduce the risks of future outbreaks of other new diseases."
Have measures to contain COVID-19 reduced air pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases?,"Air pollution is a serious health risk. It kills approximately 7 million people every year and is responsible for one third of all deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease. Over 90% of the global population lives in places where the WHO outdoor air quality guideline levels are not met, and about two-thirds of this exposure is caused by burning of fossil fuels, which also drives climate change.Efforts to control COVID-19 transmission have reduced economic activity and led to temporary improvements in air quality in some areas. In contrast, as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that drive climate change persist for a long time in the atmosphere, temporary emissions reductions only have a limited effect on atmospheric concentrations. Carbon dioxide levels at observing stations around the world in the first months of 2020 have been higher than in 2019.Environmental improvements resulting from the COVID-19 response may be reversed by a rapid expansion of polluting economic activities once the measures have ended, unless there is a clear focus to promote equity, environmental health, around a just transition to a green economy.Any short-term environmental benefits as a result of COVID-19 come at an unacceptable human and economic cost, and are no substitute for planned and sustained action on air quality and climate."
How does water scarcity affect infectious diseases like COVID-19?,"Access to adequate and safe water and sanitation is essential for communities to practice basic hygiene and reduce transmission of COVID-19. Access to these services in health facilities is crucial to preventing infections, reducing the spread of antimicrobial resistance and providing quality care. One in four health care facilities around the world lacks basic water services, directly impacting over two billion people. Around 80% of the world’s population is already experiencing some level of water scarcity. Climate change further threatens the availability of water for consumption, food production, personal hygiene, and medical care, including for infectious disease."
What can the global response to COVID-19 teach us about our response to climate change?,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), which has claimed lives, and severely disrupted communities. Climate change is a gradually increasing stress that may be the defining public health threat of the 21st century. Nonetheless, common lessons can be drawn:Ensuring universal health coverage (UHC), through well-resourced, equitable health systems, is essential to protect the public from both short and long-term health threats.Guaranteeing global health security requires an all-hazards approach to preparedness, from infectious disease outbreaks, to extreme weather events, to climate change.  Ensuring access to the environmental determinants of health, such as clean air, water and sanitation, safe and nutritious food, is an essential protection against all health risks. WHO estimates that avoidable environmental risks cause about a quarter of the global health burden.Early action saves lives. Delay in responding to clear evidence of threats, whether from pandemics, or from climate change, increases human and socioeconomic costs. Inequality is a major barrier in ensuring health and wellbeing, especially for the most vulnerable in society. Social and economic inequality manifests in unequal health risks. When faced with public health threats of a global scale, such as COVID-19 or climate change, we are only as strong as our weakest health system."
What are the tools used for contact tracing?,"Contact tracing is carried out by people who are assigned and trained to carry out this essential activity to break the chains of transmission. Electronic tools and information technology are not essential for contact tracing but can help to make it more efficient and are useful if contact tracing needs to be done on a large scale. Many digital tools have been developed to assist with COVID-19 contact tracing and case identification. These should not be considered as single solutions for contact tracing, but rather as complementary tools and should be carefully identified and analysed for technical, cost, and ethical issues.The Go.Data software application, for example, has been designed to support contact tracing and surveillance in outbreaks such as Ebola virus disease. Other tools exist for self-reporting of symptoms by contacts, as well as proximity applications that track people’s movements to indicate potential exposures to and from other persons. More on contact tracing in the context of COVID-19: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Contact_Tracing-Tools_Annex-2020.1"
What should be considered for data protection?,"The ethics of public health information, data protection, and data privacy must be considered at all levels of contact tracing activities, in all training activities for contact tracing, and when using contact tracing tools. In particular:Safeguards must be in place to guarantee privacy and data protection in accordance with the legal frameworks of the countries where systems are implemented. Everyone involved in contact tracing must adhere to the ethical principles of handling personal information, to ensure responsible data management and respect for privacy throughout the process. How data will be handled, stored, and used needs to be communicated to those concerned in a clear and transparent manner. This is important for buy-in and engagement as well as to avoid misperceptions that could jeopardize the effectiveness of a contact tracing programme. Digital tools used for contact tracing should be assessed before use to ensure safeguarding data protection according to national regulations."
Should children with developmental disabilities wear masks?,"The use of masks for children of any age with developmental disorders, disabilities or other specific health conditions should not be mandatory and be assessed on a case by case basis by the child’s parent, guardian, educator and/or medical provider. In any case, children with severe cognitive or respiratory impairments with difficulties tolerating a mask should not be required to wear masks."
Should children who have health issues or a medical condition that compromises their immune system wear a mask?,Children with underlying health conditions such as cystic fibrosis or cancer should wear a medical mask in consultation with their medical providers. A medical mask provides protection to the person wearing the mask and prevents transmission to others. It is recommended for anyone who has underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk of serious illness.
What type of mask should children wear?,"Children who are in general good health can wear a non-medical or fabric mask. This provides source control, meaning it keeps the virus from being transmitted to others if they are infected and are not aware that they are infected. The adult who is providing the mask should ensure the fabric mask is the correct size and sufficiently covers the nose, mouth and chin of the child. Children with underlying health conditions such as cystic fibrosis, cancer or immunosuppression, should, in consultation with their medical providers, wear a medical mask. A medical mask controls spreading of the virus and protection to the wearer, and is recommended for anyone who is at higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19."
How should children wear a mask?,"Children should follow the same principles as adults for wearing masks. This includes cleaning hands at least 20 seconds if using an alcohol-based hand rub, or at least 40 seconds if using soap and water, before putting on the mask. Make sure the mask is the right size to cover the nose, mouth and chin.  Children should be taught how to wear the mask properly, including not touching the front of the mask and not pulling it under the chin or into their mouth. They should store the mask in a bag or container, and not share the mask with others. More information, including videos on how to put on, take off and care for a mask, can be found here: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks"
Should a child wear a mask at home?,"Any child who has symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 should wear a medical mask, as long as they can tolerate it. The child should be isolated, and medical advice sought as soon as they start to feel unwell, even if symptoms are mild. Family members/caregivers who come within 1 metre of the sick child at home should also wear a mask.  A household member who is sick or has tested positive with the virus that causes COVID-19 should be isolated from everyone else if possible. If the child comes within 1 metre of the sick person at home, the adult and child should wear a medical mask during that time."
Should teachers or other adults working with children wear a mask?,"In areas where there is widespread transmission, all adults under the age of 60 and who are in general good health should wear fabric masks when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others. This is particularly important for adults working with children who may have close contact with children and one another. Adults aged 60 or over, or who have any underlying health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung cancer, should wear a medical mask because of their higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19. More information, including videos on how to put on, take off and care for a mask, can be found here: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks"
Should children wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities?,"Children should not wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities, such as running, jumping or playing on the playground, so that it doesn’t compromise their breathing. When organizing these activities for children, it is important to encourage all other critical public health measures: maintaining at least a 1-metre distance from others, limiting the number of children playing together, providing access to hand hygiene facilities and encouraging their use."
Are there alternatives to fabric masks such as face shields?,"In the context of COVID-19, some children may not be able to wear a mask due to disabilities or specific situations such as speech classes where the teacher needs to see their mouths. In these cases, face shields may be considered an alternative to masks, but they do not provide the equivalent protection in keeping the virus from being transmitted to others.  If a decision is made to use a face shield, it should cover the entire face, wrap around the sides of the face and extend to below the chin. Caution should be taken while wearing one to avoid injuries that could break it and harm the eyes or face."
Can COVID-19 be passed through breastfeeding?,Transmission of active COVID-19 (virus that can cause infection) through breast milk and breastfeeding has not been detected to date. There is no reason to avoid or stop breastfeeding.
"In communities where COVID-19 is prevalent, should mothers breastfeed?","Yes. In all socio-economic settings, breastfeeding improves survival and provides lifelong health and development advantages to newborns and infants. Breastfeeding also improves the health of mothers."
"Following delivery, should a baby still be immediately placed skin-to-skin and breastfed if the mother is confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19?","Yes. Immediate and continued skin-to-skin care, including kangaroo mother care, improves the temperature control of newborns and is associated with improved survival among newborn babies. Placing the newborn close to the mother also enables early initiation of breastfeeding which also reduces mortality.The numerous benefits of skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks of transmission and illness associated with COVID-19."
Can women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 breastfeed?,"Yes. Women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 can breastfeed if they wish to do so. They should:Wash hands frequently with soap and water or use alcohol-based hand rub and especially before touching the baby;Wear a medical mask during any contact with the baby, including while feeding;Sneeze or cough into a tissue. Then dispose of it immediately and wash hands again;Routinely clean and disinfect surfaces that mothers have touched.It is important to replace medical masks as soon as they become damp and dispose of them immediately. Masks should not be reused or touched in the front."
If a mother confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 does not have a medical face mask should she still breastfeed?,"Yes. Breastfeeding unquestionably reduces mortality in newborns and infants and provides numerous lifelong health and brain development advantages to the child. Mothers with symptoms of COVID-19 are advised to wear a medical mask, but even if this is not possible, breastfeeding should be continued. Mothers should follow other infection prevention measures, such as washing hands, cleaning surfaces, sneezing or
    coughing into a tissue.Non-medical masks (e.g. home-made or cloth masks) have not been evaluated. At this time, it is not possible to make a recommendation for or against their use."
Can adolescents catch COVID-19?,"Yes. All age groups can catch COVID-19. While we are still learning about how COVID-19 affects people, older persons (e.g. persons over 60 years) and persons with pre-existing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes, appear to develop serious illness more often than others. As this is a new virus, we are still learning about how it affects children and adolescents. Evidence to date suggests that children and adolescents are less likely to get severe disease, but severe cases and death can still happen in these age groups.Read more:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/key-messages-and-actions-for-covid-19-prevention-and-control-in-schools-march-2020.pdf?sfvrsn=baf81d52_4https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses"
Can adolescents spread COVID-19 to other people even if they have mild or no symptoms?,"Yes.  Infected people in all age groups – including adolescents - can transmit the virus to other people, even if  they have mild symptoms or do not feel ill. The virus is spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes or speaks. These droplets can land on objects and surfaces. People can then become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth."
"Since there are few known cases of adolescents getting seriously ill with COVID-19, should I go to a health facility if I develop symptoms of the disease?","If you have minor symptoms, such as a slight cough or a mild fever, there is generally no need to seek medical care. Stay at home, self-isolate and monitor your symptoms. Follow national guidance on self-isolation.   Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses. Seek medical care if your health gets worse, or if there is no one in your family that can take care of you at home. It is important that you follow the procedures put in place by your country. Ask a family member or another trusted adult how you can find out what these procedures are where you live.

What is COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.  WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China."
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 areFeverDry coughFatigueOther symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include:Loss of taste or smell,Nasal congestion,Conjunctivitis (also known as red eyes)Sore throat,Headache,Muscle or joint pain,Different types of skin rash,Nausea or vomiting,Diarrhea,Chills or dizziness. Symptoms of severe COVID‐19 disease include:Shortness of breath,Loss of appetite,Confusion,Persistent pain or pressure in the chest,High temperature (above 38 °C).Other less common symptoms are:Irritability,Confusion,Reduced consciousness (sometimes associated with seizures),Anxiety,Depression,Sleep disorders,More severe and rare neurological complications such as strokes, brain inflammation, delirium and nerve damage.People of all ages who experience fever and/or cough associated with difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical care immediately. If possible, call your health care provider,
            hotline or health facility first, so you can be directed to the right clinic."
I have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and am too unwell to breastfeed my baby directly. What can I do?,"If you are too unwell to breastfeed your baby due to COVID-19 or other complications, you should be supported to safely provide your baby with breast milk in a way possible, available, and acceptable to you. This could include:Expressing milk;Donor human milk. If expressing breast milk or donor human milk are not feasible then consider wet nursing (another woman breastfeeds the child) or infant formula milk with measures to ensure that it is feasible, correctly prepared, safe and sustainable."
"I had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and was unable to breastfeed, when can I start to breastfeed again?",You can start to breastfeed when you feel well enough to do so. There is no fixed time interval to wait after confirmed or suspected COVID-19. There is no evidence that breastfeeding changes the clinical course of COVID-19 in a mother. Health workers or breastfeeding counsellors should support you to relactate.
"I have confirmed or suspected COVID-19, is it safer to give my baby infant formula milk?","No. There are always risks associated with giving infant formula milk to newborns and infants in all settings. The risks associated with giving infant formula milk are increased whenever home and community conditions are compromised, such as reduced access
to health services if a baby becomes unwell, reduced access to clean water and/or access to supplies of infant formula milk are difficult or not guaranteed, affordable and sustainable.
The numerous benefits of breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks of transmission and illness associated with the COVID-19 virus."
What should I do if someone in my family gets really ill with COVID-19?,"Seek medical care, if members of your family get seriously ill.  If possible, either you or an adult should phone the local or national COVID-19 emergency number for advice on where and how you could get care. If your family member is confirmed as having COVID-19, you must be prepared that you and other known contacts will need to monitor your symptoms, and continue to self-quarantine for 14 days, even if you feel healthy.Read more:https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"
I am on medication for a chronic health condition. Should I change anything?,"It is important to continue with any medication you may be using for chronic and other conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, HIV infection and TB, and attend recommended check-ups.  Check with your health authorities and health provider if these check-ups should be done differently during the COVID-19 outbreak. Some services, such as counselling, may be available remotely. For treatment of clinically stable adolescents with HIV and adolescents with TB and/or other chronic conditions, your health provider should consider multi-month prescriptions and dispensing which will reduce the frequency of your visits to the clinic and ensure continuity of treatment, if movements are disrupted during the pandemic.  Adherence to treatment is just as important during this period.   Read more:https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-on-covid-19-hiv-and-antiretrovirals"
"I was due to get vaccinated for HPV, meningitis or tetanus, but immunization services have been disrupted. Should I be concerned?","WHO recommends that all vaccination in schools and mass campaigns should be postponed during the COVID-19 pandemic. However,  vaccines provided to adolescents have sufficiently flexible schedules to make sure you can get the vaccine in time when vaccination services start again. For example, the HPV vaccine that requires two doses can be started any time between 9 and 14 years of age and the interval between the two doses can be longer. The minimum interval between doses is 6 months, but it can be 12 or 15 months and, if necessary, even longer. It is most important hat you receive the t second dose at some point in time to be fully protected. Decisions to continue routine vaccination services are made by each country. Ask a family member or another trusted adult how you can get information about vaccination services where you live.  It is important you get the vaccines you are supposed to get, even if they have to be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Read more:https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331590/WHO-2019-nCoV-immunization_services-2020.1-eng.pdf https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331818/WHO-2019-nCoV-immunization_services-FAQ-2020.1-eng.pdf"
"I am bored staying home. Since I am very unlikely to get severely ill even if I was to get COVID-19, why is it important that I follow the guidelines to prevent transmission such as keeping physical distance from other people?","Staying at home is difficult and can get boring, but it may help to do something you enjoy. This could be reading a book, playing games or listening to music. Try to stay connected with friends and family every day either by communicating with them by phone or internet if you can, or, if you live close to them and the local rules allow you to, by talking in-person while keeping your distance.  At the same time, it is still really important that you reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by washing your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub  as often as possible, keeping at least 1 metre (3 feet) from other people, and avoiding crowded places. You might be one of the unlucky adolescents who does get severely ill if you catch COVID-19, or you could spread it to others and be responsible for them getting really ill or even dying. You have the power to make choices that could save lives and together young people can play an important part in fighting COVID-19.

Some of my friends are not sticking to the rules about physical distancing. What should I do?,"Explain to your friends why it is important to protect themselves and others by washing their hands, avoiding touching their face, always coughing or sneezing into their elbow, sleeve, or a tissue, and cooperating with physical distancing measures and movement restrictions when called on to do so. Maybe you can share ideas for fun virtual activities that your friends can participate in,  and you can encourage them to do them together with you or with other friends. This way you are giving them alternatives rather than just telling them to stay at home. But, remember that you do not have control over other peoples’ actions so do not get into an argument or a fight to try to change their minds."
I am feeling really anxious about COVID-19 and its impact on my life. What should I do?,"In situations like a pandemic it is very normal to feel anxious and powerless, and that is ok. Here are a few suggestions on things that could help you proactively manage your anxiety: Think about how you are feeling. Don’t ignore your feelings, especially if you don’t feel well. When your life is disrupted, it is normal to have many different feelings: worry, frustration, sad, stress, anger, anxiety - this can happen to everyone.  Draw on skills and strategies you have used in the past that have helped you to manage life challenges, and skills to help you manage your emotions. Here are a few examples:Keep a diary Express your feelings through art, like writing a poem, drawing, dancing, or playing music Talk about your feelings and concerns with someone you trust Try some breathing exercises. You may find guided breathing exercises online if you have access to internet.  Do something active every day: Any exercise will help, as it reduces levels of the body's stress hormones, which can help your body and mind relax. Exercise also produces a “feel good hormone” called endorphins which can help to improve your mood. Try taking a walk, running, or any physical activity outdoors while keeping a distance from others. For those who are unable to leave the house, you could open the window for fresh air and do some indoor exercises to stay active. Don’t use smoking, eating, alcohol or other drugs to deal with your emotions. Stay connected with friends and family either by communicating with them by phone or internet if you can., If you live close to them and the local rules allow you to, you could also talk to them in person while keeping your distance.Keep a daily routine as much as possible. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same times every day, making sure you get enough sleep. Plan ahead and try to have a balance of activities such as keeping up with schoolwork, physical exercise, connecting with friends and family, doing things you enjoy, and eating regular meals. Talk to a health worker or counsellor if you, or someone you care about:feel overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, fears and worries feel like stress gets in the way of your daily routines, orfeel like you want to harm yourself or others. At this time, you may find it easier to speak to a counsellor than a health worker, given that there may be restrictions on movement and health facilities may be busy caring for those with COVID-19.   Read more: https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/coping-with-stress.pdf https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/helping-children-cope-with-stress-print.pdf https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/mental-health-considerations.pdf https://www.un.org/youthenvoy/2020/04/copingwithcovid-a-webinar-series-on-young-people-and-mental-health/ https://www.voicesofyouth.org/campaign/covid-19-and-youth-mental-health"
What happens to people who get COVID-19?,"Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care. Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys. In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection."
Who is most at risk of severe illness from COVID-19?,"People aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, obesity or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness. However, anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age."
Are there long-term effects of COVID-19?,"Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms, including fatigue, respiratory and neurological symptoms. WHO is working with our Global Technical Network for Clinical Management of COVID-19, researchers and patient groups around the world to design and carry out studies of patients beyond the initial acute course of illness to understand the proportion of patients who have long term effects, how long they persist, and why they occur.  These studies will be used to develop further guidance for patient care."
How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?,"Stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, especially when distancing cannot be maintained, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds and close contact, regularly cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!Read our public advice page for more information."
When should I get a test for COVID-19?,"Anyone with symptoms should be tested, wherever possible. People who do not have symptoms but have had close contact with someone who is, or may be, infected may also consider testing – contact your local health guidelines and follow their guidance.  While a person is waiting for test results, they should remain isolated from others. Where testing capacity is limited, tests should first be done for those at higher risk of infection, such as health workers, and those at higher risk of severe illness such as older people, especially those living in seniors’ residences or long-term care facilities."
What test should I get to see if I have COVID-19?,"In most situations, a molecular test is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 and confirm infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most commonly used molecular test. Samples are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. Molecular tests detect virus in the sample by amplifying viral genetic material to detectable levels. For this reason, a molecular test is used to confirm an active infection, usually within a few days of exposure and around the time that symptoms may begin."
What about rapid tests?,"Rapid antigen tests (sometimes known as a rapid diagnostic test – RDT) detect viral proteins (known as antigens). Samples are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. These tests are cheaper than PCR and will offer results more quickly, although they are generally less accurate. These tests perform best when there is more virus circulating in the community and when sampled from an individual during the time they are most infectious."
"I want to find out if I had COVID-19 in the past, what test could I take?","Antibody tests can tell us whether someone has had an infection in the past, even if they have not had symptoms. Also known as serological tests and usually done on a blood sample, these tests detect antibodies produced in response to an infection. In most people, antibodies start to develop after days to weeks and can indicate if a person has had past infection. Antibody tests cannot be used to diagnose COVID-19 in the early stages of infection or disease but can indicate whether or not someone has had the disease in the past."
What is the difference between isolation and quarantine?,"Both isolation and quarantine are methods of preventing the spread of COVID-19.Quarantine is used for anyone who is a contact of someone infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, whether the infected person has symptoms or not. Quarantine means that you remain separated from others because you have been exposed to the virus and you may be infected and can take place in a designated facility or at home. For COVID-19, this means staying in the facility or at home for 14 days. Isolation is used for people with COVID-19 symptoms or who have tested positive for the virus. Being in isolation means being separated from other people, ideally in a medically facility where you can receive clinical care.  If isolation in a medical facility is not possible and you are not in a high risk group of developing severe disease, isolation can take place at home. If you have symptoms, you should remain in isolation for at least 10 days plus an additional 3 days without symptoms. If you are infected and do not develop symptoms, you should remain in isolation for 10 days from the time you test positive."
What should I do if I have been exposed to someone who has COVID-19?,"If you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, you may become infected, even if you feel well. After exposure to someone who has COVID-19, do the following: Call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline to find out where and when to get a test. Cooperate with contact-tracing procedures to stop the spread of the virus. If testing is not available, stay home and away from others for 14 days. While you are in quarantine, do not go to work, to school or to public places. Ask someone to bring you supplies.Keep at least a 1-metre distance from others, even from your family members. Wear a medical mask to protect others, including if/when you need to seek medical care.Clean your hands frequently.Stay in a separate room from other family members, and if not possible, wear a medical mask.Keep the room well-ventilated.If you share a room, place beds at least 1 metre apart.Monitor yourself for any symptoms for 14 days.  Stay positive by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising at home.If you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever, seek medical help if you have a fever. While travelling to and from the health facility and during medical care, wear a mask, keep at least a 1-metre distance from other people and avoid touching surfaces with your hands. This applies to adults and children. Read our malaria and COVID-19 Q&A for more information."
What is contact tracing and why is it important?,"People in close contact with someone who is infected with a 
virus, such as the Ebola virus, are at higher risk of becoming infected 
themselves, and of potentially further infecting others. Closely watching these contacts after exposure to an infected 
person will help the contacts to get care and treatment, and will 
prevent further transmission of the virus.This monitoring process is called contact tracing, which can be broken down into 3 basic steps:Contact identification: Once someone is confirmed as 
infected with a virus, contacts are identified by asking about the 
person’s activities and the activities and roles of the people around 
them since onset of illness.  Contacts can be anyone who has been in 
contact with an infected person: family members, work colleagues, 
friends, or health care providers.Contact listing: All persons considered to have contact 
with the infected person should be listed as contacts. Efforts should be
 made to identify every listed contact and to inform them of their 
contact status, what it means, the actions that will follow, and the 
importance of receiving early care if they develop symptoms. Contacts 
should also be provided with information about prevention of the 
disease. In some cases, quarantine or isolation is required for high 
risk contacts, either at home, or in hospital. Contact follow-up: Regular follow-up should be conducted with all contacts to monitor for symptoms and test for signs of infection."
What is a clinical trial,"For the purposes of registration, a clinical trial is any research
 study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans
 to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on 
health outcomes. Clinical trials may also be referred to as 
interventional trials. Interventions include but are not restricted to 
drugs, cells and other biological products, surgical procedures, 
radiologic procedures, devices, behavioural treatments, process-of-care 
changes, preventive care, etc. This definition includes Phase I to Phase IV trials."
Which trials should be registered?,"All clinical trials meeting the above definition should be 
registered. Thus, early and late trials, trials of marketed or 
non-marketed products, randomized or non-randomized trials -- all should
 be registered."
What is the difference between a clinical trials register and a clinical trials registry?,"A clinical trials register is the formal record of an 
internationally agreed minimum amount of information about a clinical 
trial. This record is usually stored in and managed using a database. A 
clinical trials registry is the entity that houses the register, and is 
responsible for ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the 
information it contains, and that the registered information is used to 
inform health care decision making. A clinical trials registry is more 
than its database."
Why register clinical trials?,"Why is Trial Registration Important?The registration of all interventional trials is considered to be a scientific, ethical and moral responsibility because:There is a need to ensure that decisions about health care are informed by all of the available evidence.It is difficult to make informed decisions if publication bias and selective reporting are present.The Declaration of Helsinki
 states that ""Every clinical trial must be registered in a publicly 
accessible database before recruitment of the first subject"".Improving awareness of similar or identical trials will make it 
possible for researchers and funding agencies to avoid unnecessary 
duplication.Describing clinical trials in progress can make it easier to identify gaps in clinical trials research.Making researchers and potential participants aware of recruiting trials may facilitate recruitment.Enabling researchers and health care practitioners to identify 
trials in which they may have an interest could result in more effective
 collaboration among researchers. The type of collaboration may include prospective meta-analysis.Registries checking data as part of the registration process may 
lead to improvements in the quality of clinical trials by making it 
possible to identify potential problems (such as problematic 
randomization methods) early in the research process."
Who is responsible for registering a trial?,"An appropriate representative of the trial’s primary Sponsor.
 The Responsible Registrant is responsible for ensuring that the trial 
is properly registered. The primary Sponsor may or may not be the 
primary funder. The responsible registrant should make every reasonable 
effort to ensure that a trial is registered once and only once in any 
one register, and that the trial is registered in the fewest number of 
registers necessary to meet applicable regulations."
When should trials be registered?,Trials should be registered before the first participant is recruited.
When will this pandemic end so I can go back to school and meet up with my friends?,"We don’t know when the pandemic will end, but we know it depends on every individual’s contribution in helping stop the transmission. The sacrifices you have made by not seeing your friends and by stopping going to school and other activities are your contributions to fighting the pandemic. By putting societies and economies on hold, we have reduced the ability of the virus to spread through our communities. These defensive measures have helped to limit some of the short-term impacts of the virus, and bought us time to translate what we have learned about the virus into solutions so that we can get back to a more familiar way of living. It is important that you continue to practise these measures and encourage your friends to do the same.  Read more:https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"
Schools are reopening in some areas of my country. Is it safe to go back to school?,"A decision to reopen schools in every country and area is made based on careful assessment of the situation, with consensus among all the key parties involved, including the health and education policy-makers, teachers and other school staff, parents and health and community workers. In addition, the reopening of schools are carefully planned and prepared, with all necessary measures in place to protect the safety and health of everyone in the school community.Therefore, if your school reopens, you should feel assured it is safe for you to go back to school – provided that you strictly follow the guidelines and rules that will be provided by your school.Of course, if you have any concerns with going back to school, do not hesitate to speak out to your teachers and parents or guardians. Read more:School reopening, UNESCO COVID-19 Education Response Education Sector Issue Note 7.1, April 2020Prepare for school reopening, IIEP-UNESCO's COVID response brief, April 2020"
How long does it take to develop symptoms?,"The time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 1-14 days. This is why people who have been exposed to the virus are advised to remain at home and stay away from others, for 14 days, in order to prevent the spread of the virus, especially where testing is not easily available."
Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?,"Not yet. Many potential vaccines for COVID-19 are being studied, and several large clinical trials may report results later this year. If a vaccine is
    proven safe and effective, it must be approved by national regulators, manufactured, and distributed. WHO is working with partners around the world to help coordinate key steps in this process. WHO is working through the ACT-Accelerator to facilitate equitable access to a safe and effective vaccine for the billions of people who will need it, once it is available. More information about COVID-19 vaccine development is available here."
What should I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms?,"If you have any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for instructions and find out when and where to get a test, stay at home for 14 days away from others and monitor your health. If you have shortness of breath or pain or pressure in the chest, seek medical attention at a health facility immediately. Call your health care provider or hotline in advance for direction to the right health facility. If you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever, seek medical care if you have a fever.If local guidance recommends visiting a medical centre for testing, assessment or isolation, wear a medical mask while travelling to and from the facility and during medical care. Also keep at least a 1-metre distance from other people and avoid touching surfaces with your hands.  This applies to adults and children."
Are there treatments for COVID-19?,"Scientists around the world are working to find and develop treatments for COVID-19. Optimal supportive care includes oxygen for severely ill patients and those who are at risk for severe disease and more advanced respiratory support such as ventilation for patients who are critically ill. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce the length of time on a ventilator and save lives of patients with severe and critical illness. Read our dexamethasone Q&A for more information.  Results from the WHO’s Solidarity Trial indicated that remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon regimens appear to have little or no effect on 28-day mortality or the in-hospital course of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients. Hydroxychloroquine has not been shown to offer any benefit for treatment of COVID-19. Read our hydroxychloroquine Q&A for more information. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19 and will continue to provide new information as it becomes available."
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?,"Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19.In hospitals, physicians will sometimes use antibiotics to prevent or treat secondary bacterial infections which can be a complication of COVID-19 in severely ill patients. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection."
Can I register with the WHO ICTRP?,"No, WHO does not maintain its own registry so you cannot register your trial directly with us."
What information needs to be registered?,"The minimum information that must be registered is specified in the WHO Trial Registration Data Set. Individual registers may request more information than this (e.g., study sites)."
Are there software or hardware specifications that should be followed for building a trial registry?,"Yes, please contact us."
How many times should a trial be registered?,"To meet WHO requirements for transparency and publication it is 
only necessary for your trial to be to registered once, in either a Primary Registry or an ICMJE approved registry."
How do I cite a record on a clinical trials register?,"Please read this document, pdf 21kb"
When to cite a record on a clinical trials register,"The registry record will be the only publicly available 
document on a trial until results from the trial are published. Some 
examples of situations when studies might be quoted are:When a manuscript reporting the results of the trial is published or otherwise reportedWhen a manuscript reporting methodological issues relating to a particular trial are published or otherwise reportedIn protocols to systematic reviews, or in completed systematic reviews (e.g. when a list of ongoing trials are included)In protocols to prospective meta-analyses, which will list the ongoing trials to be includedIn any manuscript when reference to an ongoing or unpublished (or even published) trial might be relevant"
What is trial registration?,"WHO regards trial registration as the publication of an internationally-agreed set of information
 about the design, conduct and administration of clinical trials. These 
details are published on a publicly-accessible website managed by a 
registry conforming to WHO standards.What is the ICTRP?The ICTRP is a global initiative that aims to make information
 about all clinical trials involving humans publicly available. It also 
aims to:To improve the comprehensiveness, completeness and accuracy of registered clinical trial dataTo communicate and raise awareness of the need to register clinical trialsTo ensure the accessibility of registered data To build capacity for clinical trial registrationTo encourage the utilization of registered dataTo ensure the sustainability of the ICTRP"
What does the ICTRP do?,The ICTRP:Publishes the ICTRP Search PortalSupports the WHO Registry NetworkSupports countries and regions wanting to establish WHO-compliant clinical trial registries or policies on trial registration.
How does the ICTRP support countries and regions?,"If an agency in a member state (such as a Ministry of Health 
or a National Regulatory Authority) is interested in establishing a new 
clinical trial registry that complies with WHO criteria (or improving an
 existing registry), or in establishing policies that require 
registration in an existing Primary Registry, then they can approach the
 ICTRP for support. The types of support requested will vary and depend 
on the specific needs of the member state. It may include:Advice on how to meet the criteria required by a Primary Registry in the WHO Registry NetworkThe different models for achieving trial registration and the 
need to work with key agencies such as regulatory authorities and 
research ethics committees (or Institutional Review Boards) to ensure 
complianceDatabase and software issues, including data interchange standardsDeveloping and implementing standard operating procedures to ensure high quality dataFacilitating collaboration with other member states, particularly those in the same region or those that speak the same languageThe ICTRP works with only 1 registry per member state, and 
encourages collaboration across member states to build regional 
solutions, particularly when languages are shared. If a member state has
 more than one registry then it is up to that member state to determine 
which one will be the national registry."
"I know there is a risk of getting COVID-19 at the moment, but I feel fine. Can I still play sports?","Yes. You can still play sports that are in line with the physical distancing measures and movement restrictions that are in place in your country. Being physically active is good for your health, both physical and mental. Set up a regular routine to practice activities or sports that do not require close contact with others every day for 1 hour. You can do individual sports, like jogging, walking, dancing or yoga. There are many options to try. You can set up playground games indoors, such as jump rope and hop-scotch, play with your brothers and sisters, and practice some strength training activities, using improvised weights like bottles full of water or sand. If you have access to the internet, you can also join in online active games or fitness classes, or set up your own online physical exercises with your friends or classmates. Find an activity that is fun, can be done within the restrictions that are in place in your country, and makes you feel good."
I am missing out on my education because of the COVID-19 pandemic. What should I do?,"Your school or place where you are studying are likely to make arrangements for you to catch up or to do exams at another time. Follow the procedures that your school has put in place to reduce the immediate impact of school closures, and to facilitate the continuity of education. If you have access to internet, you can also consult your teachers and other trusted adults to identify and access reliable online learning opportunities and resources, including those included in the distance learning solutions recommended by UNESCO, the United Nations agency that helps countries improve their education systems. In addition, UNESCO is collecting stories from students, teachers and parents about how they are coping and continuing to learn during school closures. Access those stories, they might inspire you. You can also contact UNESCO and share your story! Find out how to share it here.In places where internet connectivity is a problem, many governments have started to broadcast educational programmes on TV and radio channels during school closures. If you live in such a place, look out for educational programmes on your local TV and radio channels.

"COVID-19 is everywhere in the news, and I am finding it difficult to know what is true and what is false. What should I do?","A near-constant stream of news, sometimes contradictory, can cause anyone to feel lost and distressed. Make sure to use reliable sources such as the UNICEF and the World Health Organization’s sites to get information, or to check any information you might be getting through less reliable channels. If you have a phone, you can use the WHO Health Alert on WhatsApp to get the latest information about the pandemic. This is a new service, which is free to use, designed to give prompt, reliable and official information 24 hours a day, worldwide. Start by clicking WHO Health Alert, then simply text the word ‘Hi’ in a WhatsApp message to get started. Keep in mind that overloading yourself with information about the COVID-19 pandemic can also be stressful, so seek information updates and practical guidance at specific times during the day and avoid listening to or following rumours that make you feel uncomfortable.

Is it safe to have sex at this time?,"There is no evidence that COVID-19 is transmitted through semen or vaginal fluids. However, having sex with someone means that you are very close to them. This puts one person at risk if the other person has COVID-19. Masturbation does not involve another person, and carries no risk of COVID-19. Also, having sex with a partner whom you are living with does not carry this risk if both of you are taking steps to protect yourself from the virus. Make sure to use condoms and contraception to avoid sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy.

What is a Primary Registry?,"A Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network is a clinical trial registry with at least a national remit that meets WHO Registry Criteria
 for content, quality and validity, accessibility, unique 
identification, technical capacity and governance and administration. 
Primary Registries have the support of the ICMJE."
How does a registry become a Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network?,"The ICTRP is a country-led initiative. Clinical trial 
registration happens when countries seek to improve the transparency of 
clinical trial research involving nationals of that country, and to be 
more accountable to the individuals who consent to participate in 
clinical research, and to better oversee and monitor that research. It 
is up to each country to decide if they want to have a clinical trial 
registry and, if so, where that registry will be housed.To become a Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network a registry must:Submit a Registry Profile (available from the ICTRP Secretariat)Meet all of the WHO Registry CriteriaBe approved by the Assistant Director General of the Information Evidence and Research cluster of the World Health OrganizationView the list Primary Registries in the WHO Registry Network. Only registries on this list meet WHO requirements.
				The designation as a Primary Registry in the WHO Registry 
Network is conditional on continuing compliance with WHO Registry 
criteria."
What should I do if I want to take part in clinical trial?,"If you are patient or family member and you find a trial that 
is of interest we suggest that you print out the information and discuss
 it with your health care provider. They should be able to advise you on
 the appropriate course of action.If you are a health care provider or researcher you should approach one of the contact persons listed in the registered record."
How can I register a trial?,"You cannot register a trial with WHO. The WHO ICTRP is not a clinical trials registry.To register a trial, submit the details directly to any one of the Primary Registries in the WHO Registry Network or an  ICMJE approved registry.To meet the requirements of the International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) you can register your trial with any 
Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network or an ICMJE approved 
registry.To meet WHO requirements for transparency and publication, it 
is only necessary for your trial to be registered once, in either a 
Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network or an ICMJE approved 
registry.NOTE: Regulatory, legal, ethical, funding and other 
requirements for oversight and conduct of clinical trials differ from 
country to country. It is recommended that those responsible for 
conducting a clinical trial check to make sure they are complying with 
the specific requirements of each country."

"In the lockdown, I am spending much more time online playing games, socialising and studying. Should I be worried about this?","COVID-19 has abruptly pushed many people’s daily lives online, and you may be spending even more hours online than before. While online solutions provide huge opportunities for continuing your learning, socializing and playing, you should try to limit the amount of screen time that is not related to your studies or physical activity. This is because you need to be physically active to keep healthy and a positive attitude. In addition, some people are sensitive to flickering lights and may get headaches, nausea, and dizziness, and even seizures if they spend too much time in front of a screen. Therefore it is important to replace some of the recreational screen time with non-screen activities, like listening to music, reading, playing board games, and physical activity, like  going for a walk or jog. Excessive gaming can lead to “gaming disorder” that leads to reduced sleep or day-night reversal, loss of appetite, aggression, headaches, and attention problems. If you experience these symptoms, seek help from your parents or a trusted adult."
I heard I can be hurt by online contacts. What are my risks and how I can protect myself online.,"Since you might be spending even more time online than before, it is wise to be aware of some of the risks. First, be careful what content you share online. Risky behaviour, such as sexting or sharing of sexualized content, can expose you to risks of blackmail, harassment and humiliation. Second, spending more time online may increase the chances that you could come into contact with online predators who seek to sexually exploit young people. When in front of webcams wear appropriate clothing and do not connect with teachers or virtual classrooms from a bedroom. In addition, it’s important to note that some adolescents – for example those with disabilities and those perceived to be different or at greater risk of catching or spreading COVID-19 - may be at increased risk of cyberbullying and discrimination. Hurtful, discriminatory or inappropriate online contact is never okay. If in doubt, or if you feel uncomfortable or distressed about some interactions you have online, tell a parent or another trusted adult immediately.

"Since my parents stopped going out to work, they have been arguing with each other much more, and in some instances, I have seen one parent harm or hurt the other either verbally or physically. I don’t feel safe at home. What should I do?","This is a difficult time. Many people – including perhaps your parents - are worrying about security, health, and money. When people are in the cramped and confined living conditions of lockdown, these tensions and stress can become even greater. It is normal to have disagreements. However, if the disagreements become verbal or physical, then it is right to take action.   If you are worried about what is happening in your home, or don’t feel safe, talk to a trusted adult about what worries you, and seek their advice. During an argument or a fight, try not to draw attention to yourself so that you don’t end up getting hurt. It might be useful to have a safety plan in case the violence escalates. This includes preparing a bag with essential items, like clothing, documents and electric charger, and having a neighbour, friend, relative, or shelter identified to go to should you need to leave the house immediately for safety reasons. Arrange with the trusted adult to help you alert the relevant authorities who can help you stay safe, including the police, emergency health services and social services.  In many of the countries that have been most affected by COVID-19, essential services are still available, including shelters or protection services. If there are no trusted adults for you to share your concerns with, your country may have helplines, including text services so that you can communicate with someone who can help you or give you advice.

I don’t like the way someone touches me at home and we are both at home all the time because of the pandemic. What should I do?,"It is wrong for anyone to do this. And it is not your fault in any way. If you are staying in the same house as the person and/or are dependent on him (it will usually be a man), that may make some of the things that you could do difficult, especially during stay-at-home restrictions due to COVID-19. Here are some things that you can consider doing to improve your safety while in the house. You could tell him politely but firmly that you do not want him to touch you and ask him to please stop.You could inform your parents or other caregivers or trusted adult in the house about what is happening.You could inform a trusted adult outside your home such as a neighbour or a teacher or family friend or relative. If you have access to a phone, you could call or text for help and support. This includes calling hotlines/helplines for children and women who are in need of help or feeling distressed or subjected to abuse, or calling a child protection service in your area. Be careful not to leave your phone calls or text messages where anyone else could access them.  If you need to leave the house immediately because he is hurting or harming you, think of discretely (without him overhearing) pre-arranging with a neighbour or trusted relative or family friend to help you leave the house and stay with them until it is safe for you to return home. If you have been sexually abused or raped and need urgent medical help or care, go as soon as possible to the nearest hospital or clinic to ask for medical care.    Read more:  https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331699/WHO-SRH-20.04-eng.pdf"
What is asthma?,"Asthma is a common lung condition that causes sporadic breathing difficulties. It often starts in childhood, although it can also develop in adults, and affects people of all ages. There is currently no cure, but treatment can help control the symptoms. Patients can live full and rewarding lives with the right treatment and management. Asthma is caused by the swelling and narrowing of the tubes that carry air to and from the lungs."
What are the symptoms?,"Common symptoms include breathlessness, coughing and wheezing. The severity and frequency of the symptoms vary from person to person, and for some, become worse during physical activity and at night. Symptoms sometimes get significantly worse. This is commonly known as an asthma attack."
What are asthma attacks?,"Asthma attacks can be fatal but are largely preventable and manageable. Breathlessness, coughing and wheezing will likely be worse, and the patient may be too breathless to speak, eat or sleep. If a person appears to be having an asthma attack they should sit up straight and take slow, regular breaths, and take regular breaths from their inhaler, as per their treatment plan instructions. If possible, a medical professional should be contacted immediately. Regular checkups and the right treatment will help prevent asthma attacks."
What are the treatment options?,"Asthma is incurable, but manageable. Treatment and vigilance and regular medical checks are crucial. Patients can live rewarding, fulfilling lives with the right treatment. Asthma is often treated using an inhaler to breathe in medicines. People with ongoing symptoms will need to take daily medication for the long-term. It’s also important for people living with asthma to avoid triggers. With medical support, individuals should learn what their own triggers are and take steps to avoid them."
Are there other complications?,"Symptoms can also cause sleeplessness, daytime fatigue and missing commitments such as school and work."
What causes asthma?,"Asthma is caused by the swelling and narrowing of the tubes that carry air to and from the lungs. The fundamental causes of the disease are likely to be a combination of genetics – for example if your parents have it or it is common in your family – and external triggers, such as: Allergies to house dust mites, pollen and animal fur. Tobacco smoke, pollution and cold air. Chemical irritants in the workplace such as paint, varnishes and adhesives. Other triggers can include extreme emotional duress, exercise, and for some people, certain medicines."
How prevalent is asthma globally?,Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children worldwide. More than 339 million people are living with asthma. Over 80% of asthma-related deaths occur in low-and lower-middle income countries. Treatment and effective management of asthma saves lives.
What is bronchiectasis?,"Bronchiectasis is an abnormal widening of one or more airways. Normally, tiny glands in the lining of the airways make a small amount of mucus. Mucus keeps the airways moist and  traps any dust and dirt in the inhaled air. Because bronchiectasis creates an abnormal widening of the airways, extra mucus tends to form and pool in parts of the widened airways. Widened airways with extra mucus are prone to infection."
What are the symptoms?,"The main symptom of bronchiectasis is a cough that produces a lot of sputum, wheeziness, tiredness and poor concentration. A lung scan and other lung and sputum tests help to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment includes regular physiotherapy, which helps coughing up and clearing the mucus, and courses of antibiotics. Surgery is occasionally needed."
What are the causes?,"The cause of bronchiectasis is often not clear. Some conditions that affect or damage airways can cause the disease, for example: Some inherited conditions. For example, a condition called primary ciliary dyskinesia affects the cilia so they do not move correctly to clear the mucus. Cystic fibrosis is another condition that affects the lungs and causes bronchiectasis. Inhaled objects can become stuck and block an airway. This may lead to local damage to that airway. Acid from the stomach that is regurgitated and inhaled can damage airways as well as inhaling poisonous gases.Severe lung infections such as tuberculosis (TB), whooping cough, pneumonia or measles can damage the airways at the time of infection. Bronchiectasis may then develop."
How should this problem be addressed?,"Enabling those “in the front line” - the health professionals dealing with children and adolescent’s health- to recognize and assess diseases linked to, or triggered by environmental factors. Paediatricians, family doctors, nurses, primary and other health care workers should be trained on the relationships between children's health and the environment through the use of harmonized training materials, adaptable to the specific needs of countries and professional groups."
What are the benefits of training health care providers?,"- Increased understanding about the influence of environmental factors on children’s health- Improved quality of diagnosis and management of environmentally-related health and developmental effects- Capacity to discuss environmental risks with patients, parents, educators and the media- Advocacy skills for sensitizing decision-makers about high priority issues for action- Enhanced potential for research on children's health"
What is the WHO Training Package for Health Care Providers?,"A collection of modules with internationally harmonized information and peer-reviewed materials to enable health care workers to be trained, and also to become trainers of their peers and colleagues. The modules include extensive notes and references, case studies and self-evaluation tools, backed up by manuals and guidelines. A selected team of experienced professionals from over 15 countries, the International Paediatric Association (IPA) and selected NGOs are participating in its preparation.This initiative was made possible thanks to the financial support provided by the US EPA Office of Children’s Health Protection, that also made available useful data, graphics and text for the modules. Further financial support for update of materials was received from the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety, Germany."
What issues are covered?,"- The special vulnerability of children to physical, chemical and biological environmental threats- The health and developmental effects of specific chemical, physical and biological hazards (e.g. pesticides, persistent toxic pollutants –POPs- , lead, arsenic, radiation, noise, moulds, other) present in specific settings (e.g. home and surroundings, school, recreation areas, workplace, fields, other)- Sources, routes and mechanisms of exposure (contaminants in air, water, food, cosmetics, objects, toys, medical devices, that may be inhaled, ingested or absorbed…)- Illustrative case studies."
How are the training programmes organized and by whom?,"Training events are organized according to the needs identified by the countries and/or scientific groups concerned and financial resources available. WHO provides technical advice on the contents and methodology. The event may go from a 1-day introductory course to a full 40-hour course that enables to cover the entire contents of the package. WHO and its partners provide the distribution of materials, some of which are available as informal versions in Portuguese, Japanese and other languages thanks to the contribution of partners in different countries."
What is land degradation?,"Land degradation is caused by multiple forces, including extreme weather conditions, particularly drought. It is also caused by human activities that pollute or degrade the quality of soils and land utility. It negatively affects food production, livelihoods, and the production and provision of other ecosystem goods and services. Desertification is a form of land degradation by which fertile land becomes desert."
What are the threats to land integrity?,"Land degradation has accelerated during the 20th and 21st centuries due to increasing and combined pressures of agricultural and livestock production (over-cultivation, overgrazing, forest conversion), urbanization, deforestation and extreme weather events such as droughts and coastal surges, which salinate land."
What does land degradation mean for the planet?,"These social and environmental processes are stressing the world's arable lands and pastures essential for the provision of food and water and quality air. Land degradation and desertification can affect human health through complex pathways. As land is degraded and deserts expand in some places, food production is reduced, water sources dry up and populations are pressured to move to more hospitable areas."
What effect does desertification on human health?,The potential impacts of desertification on health include:higher threats of      malnutrition from reduced food and water supplies;more water- and food-borne      diseases that result from poor hygiene and a lack of clean water; respiratory diseases caused      by atmospheric dust from wind erosion and other air pollutants; the spread of infectious      diseases as populations migrate.
What is the recommended food for children in their very early years?,"Breast milk is the best food for the healthy growth and 
development of infants. Infants should be exclusively breastfed for the 
first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and 
health. After six months, they should be fed adequate and safe 
complementary foods while continuing breastfeeding for up to two years 
or beyond. 
		Complementary foods should be rich in nutrients and given in 
adequate amounts.  At six months, caregivers should introduce foods in 
small amounts and gradually increase the quantity as the child gets 
older. Young children should receive a variety of foods including meat, 
poultry, fish or eggs as often as possible. Infants can eat pureed, 
mashed and semi-solid foods beginning at 6 months, from 8 months, most 
infants can eat 'finger' foods, and from 12 months, most children can 
eat the same types of foods as consumed by the rest of the family. The 
consistency of foods should be appropriate for the child's age. 
Complementary foods should be given 2–3 times a day between 6–8 months, 
increasing to 3–4 times a day between 9–11 months. Between 12–23 months 
of age, 3–4 meals should be given. Also, depending on the child's 
appetite, 1–2 nutritious snacks can be offered between meals.  In addition to providing an adequate variety, amount and 
frequency of foods, it is important that caregivers practice responsive 
feeding.  That is, they should feed infants directly and assist older 
children when they feed themselves; feed slowly and patiently and 
encourage children to eat, but not force them; and when children refuse 
to eat, experiment with different combinations of foods. Feeding times 
are periods of learning and love - they are a time for caregivers to 
talk to the child, making eye to eye contact. These recommendations are made in the Global Strategy for 
Infant and Young Child Feeding, which was jointly developed by WHO and 
UNICEF in 2003. The strategy is a guide for countries to develop policies and 
implement activities addressing feeding practices and the nutritional 
status, growth and health of infants and children. It is based both on 
the evidence that nutrition plays a crucial role in the early months and
 years of life, and on the importance of appropriate feeding practices 
in achieving optimal health. Lack of appropriate feeding in early childhood is a major risk
 factor for ill-health throughout the course of life. The life-long 
impact may include poor school performance, reduced productivity, 
impaired intellectual and social development, or chronic diseases.Related linksNutrition"
What are the key health dangers for children?,"Nearly 6.9 million children under the age of five died in 2011 – nearly 800 every hour – but most could survive threats and thrive with access to simple, affordable interventions.The risk of death is highest in the first month of life. Preterm birth, birth asphyxia and infections cause most newborn deaths. Health risks to newborns are minimized by:quality care during pregnancy;safe delivery by a skilled birth attendant; andstrong neonatal care: immediate attention to breathing and warmth, hygienic cord and skin care, and early initiation of exclusive breastfeeding.From one month to five years of age, the main causes of death are pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria and measles. Malnutrition is estimated to contribute to more than one third of all child deaths.Pneumonia is the prime cause of death in children under five years of age. Addressing the major risk factors – including malnutrition and indoor air pollution – is essential to preventing pneumonia, as are vaccination and breastfeeding. Antibiotics and oxygen are vital tools for effectively managing the illness.Diarrhoeal diseases are a leading cause of sickness and death among children in developing countries. Breastfeeding helps prevent diarrhoea among young children. Treatment for sick children with Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) combined with zinc supplements is safe, cost-effective, and saves lives.One child dies every minute from malaria. Insecticide-treated nets prevent transmission and increase child survival.Over 90% of children with HIV are infected through mother-to-child transmission; this can be prevented with antiretrovirals, as well as safer delivery and feeding practices.Worldwide, about 20% of deaths among children under-five could be avoided if feeding guidelines are followed. WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months, introducing age-appropriate and safe complementary foods at six months, and continuing breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond.About two-thirds of child deaths are preventable through practical, low-cost interventions. WHO is improving child health by helping countries to deliver integrated, effective care in a continuum - starting with a healthy pregnancy for the mother, through birth and care up to five years of age. Investing in strong health systems is key to prevention and delivery of quality care."

What is chikungunya fever?,Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bites of infected mosquitoes. Chikungunya fever typically lasts from five to seven days and frequently causes severe and often incapacitating joint pain which sometimes persists for much longer periods. It is rarely life-threatening. There is no specific treatment for the disease but analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication may be used to reduce the pain and swelling. Aspirin should be avoided.
How can chikungunya be prevented?,"There is no vaccine against this virus, so preventive measures depend entirely on avoiding mosquito bites which occur mainly during the daytime, and eliminating mosquito breeding sites.To avoid mosquito bites:wear clothes that cover as      much skin as possible;use mosquito repellents on      exposed skin and on clothing in accordance with label instructions;use mosquito nets to protect      babies, older and sick people and others who rest during the day. The      effectiveness of mosquito nets can be improved by treating them with      WHO-recommended insecticides.use mosquito coils and      insecticide vaporizers during the daytime.The Aedes mosquitoes that transmit chikungunya virus breed in a wide variety of rain-filled containers which are common around human dwellings and workplaces, such as water storage containers, saucers under potted plants and drinking bowls for domestic animals, as well as discarded tyres and food containers.To reduce mosquito breeding:remove discarded containers      from around the house;for containers that are in      use, turn them over or empty every 3–4 days to prevent mosquito breeding      including any water-filled containers indoors. Alternatively, completely      cover them to keep out mosquitoes."
How common is chikungunya fever?,"Between February and October 2006 alone, more than 1.25 million people in India and south Asia were infected with the chikungunya virus. Other large-scale outbreaks of chikungunya fever have occurred in countries of east and central Africa, and the Indian Ocean countries, including Comoros, Gabon, Madagascar, the Maldives, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion (France) and the Seychelles. In September 2007, a chikungunya outbreak following an imported case has been notified in northern Italy. The dramatic resurgence and geographic extension of chikungunya in recent years underlines our vulnerability to emerging infectious diseases spread by insects and emphasizes the importance of sustained control programmes as an essential component of health security."
What are pesticides?,"Pesticides are chemical compounds that are used to kill pests, including insects, rodents, fungi and unwanted plants (weeds). Over 1000 different pesticides are used around the world. Pesticides are used in public health to kill vectors of disease, such as mosquitoes, and in agriculture to kill pests that damage crops."
Are pesticides harmful to human health?,"By their nature, pesticides are potentially toxic to other organisms, including humans, and need to be used safely and disposed of properly. They are among the leading causes of death by self-poisoning, and this burden is felt disproportionately in low- and middle-income countries. Many of the older, cheaper (off-patent) pesticides, such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and lindane, can remain for years in soil and water. These have adverse effects on larger parts of the ecosystem and can accumulate in the food chain. These chemicals have been banned by countries who signed the 2001 Stockholm Convention."
Who is at risk?,"The general population is exposed to low levels of pesticides through food and water, and these are not typically cause for concern. People at higher risk of adverse health effects are those who work directly with pesticides, such as agricultural workers, and those who are in the immediate area when pesticides are applied. People not involved with applying the pesticide should avoid the area during and immediately after its use."
How can I protect myself when handling or applying pesticides?,"WHO recommends reducing the use of pesticides when possible. First, determine to what extend the use of pesticides are actually needed. Look for ways to solve the issue with non-chemical pest management where possible.If pesticides are necessary, seek products with the lowest risk to human health and the environment.When using pesticides, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for application and personal safety. In many cases, personal protective equipment (PPE) is appropriate to avoid direct contact with the pesticide and minimize exposure during handling and application."
Are there international agreements about the use of pesticides?,"International conventions, such as the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent, provide a means for countries to protect their populations from exposure to toxic pesticides. Successful implementation of these conventions requires information about the incidence and circumstances of pesticide exposures, and about the health impact of exposure. In many countries such information is still lacking."
What is the recommended food for children in their very early years?,"Breast milk is the best food for the healthy growth and development of infants. Infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. After six months, they should be fed adequate and safe complementary foods while continuing breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond.Complementary foods should be rich in nutrients and given in adequate amounts.

Feeding times are periods of learning and love - they are a time for caregivers to talk to the child, making eye to eye contact."
Up to what age can a baby stay well nourished by just being breastfed?,"Infants should be exclusively breastfed – i.e. receive only breast milk – for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as giving no other food or drink – not
    even water – except breast milk. It does, however, allow the infant to receive oral rehydration salts (ORS), drops and syrups (vitamins, minerals and medicines). Breast milk is the ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants;
    breastfeeding is also an integral part of the reproductive process with important implications for the health of mothers."
What is the source of these recommendations?,"These recommendations are made in the Global Strategy for Infant and 
Young Child Feeding, which was jointly developed by WHO and UNICEF in 
2003.The strategy is a guide for countries to develop policies 
and implement activities addressing feeding practices and the 
nutritional status, growth and health of infants and children. It is

feeding practices in achieving optimal health.Lack of appropriate
 feeding in early childhood is a major risk factor for ill-health 
throughout the course of life. The life-long impact may include poor 
school performance, reduced productivity, impaired intellectual and 
social development, or chronic diseases."
When and how should a child transition to other foods?,"WHO recommends that infants start receiving complementary foods at 
six months (180 days) of age in addition to breast milk. Foods should be
 adequate, meaning that they provide sufficient energy, protein and 
micronutrients to meet a growing child's nutritional
    needs. Foods should be prepared and given in a safe manner to 
minimize the risk of contamination. Feeding young infants requires 
active care and stimulation to encourage the child to eat.The 
transition from exclusive breastfeeding to full use of family foods is a
 very vulnerable period. It is the time when many infants become 
malnourished, contributing significantly to the high prevalence of 
malnutrition in children under five years of
    age worldwide. It is essential therefore that infants receive 
appropriate, adequate and safe complementary foods to ensure the right 
transition from the breastfeeding period to the full use of family 
foods.Amounts of foods to offerAgeTextureFrequencyAmount at each meala6-8 monthsStart with thick porridge, well mashed foodsContinue with mashed family foods2–3 meals per day, plus frequent breastfeedsDepending on the child's appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offeredStart with 2–3 tablespoonfuls per feed, increasing gradually to ½ of a 250 ml cup9–11 monthsFinely chopped or mashed foods, and foods that baby can pick up3–4 meals per day, plus breastfeedsDepending on the child's appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered½ of a 250 ml cup/bowl12–23 monthsFamily foods, chopped or mashed if necessary3–4 meals per day, plus breastfeedsDepending on the child's appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered¾ to full 250 ml cup/bowla Note: If baby is not breastfed, give in addition: 1-2 cups of milk per day, and 1-2 extra meals per day."
What is Chagas disease?,"Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi or (T. cruzi).It is found mainly in 21 Latin American countries, where it is mostly vector-borne. The main vector involved in the transmission of the parasite to humans is a triatomine bug, also known as a ‘kissing bug’. An estimated 8 million people are infected worldwide, mostly in Latin America. Chagas disease is clinically curable if treatment is initiated at an early stage. Therefore universal access to prompt diagnosis and care is essential.Once totally confined to the Region of the Americas, Chagas disease has spread to other continents over the last century mainly because of enhanced means of travel and global population movement to and from Latin America.It is estimated that over 10 000 people die every year from clinical manifestations of Chagas disease, and more than 25 million people risk acquiring the disease.Vector control remains the most useful method to prevent infection. Blood screening is vital to avoid infection through transfusion and organ transplantation. Screening and diagnosis in pregnant women and their children are essential control measures.Chagas disease is named after Carlos Justiniano Chagas, a Brazilian doctor, who discovered the disease in 1909."
Who is the vector of Chagas disease?,"The Chagas disease vector is an insect of the Hemiptera order (adults have wings and fly), Reduviidae family and Triatominae subfamily (which feed on blood at all stages of their development) and mainly from the genera Triatoma, Panstrongylus and Rhodnius, but also from 12 other genera.In the Region of the Americas, Chagas disease is transmitted by several species of the triatomine bugs that typically live in the cracks of poorly constructed dwellings in rural areas and suburban slums in Latin America.The bugs hide during the day and emerge at night to feed on human blood, usually when people are asleep. Other infected triatomine bug species may be found in areas surrounding houses and in wild environments. Exchange of infection is therefore possible in such environment.Distribution of vectorsThe distribution of vectors and wild reservoirs of T. cruzi in the Americas extends from the United States of America to Argentina and Chile (latitudes 46°N to 46°S). Triatomine bugs have also been found outside the Region of the Americas, but up to now none of them have been found to be infected.More than 150 species of triatomine bugs and >100 species of mammals, mostly wild species, maintain T. cruzi infection in nature.With such a wide reservoir, Chagas disease is not eradicable.The vector was first described in 1773 by the Swedish scientist Charles De Geer, through the observation of an insect captured in the old so-called ""Indies"" (assumed to refer to the East Indies, probably Indonesia).Triatomine bug species with the capacity to transmit T. cruzi have been identified since the 18th century along maritime travel routes to parts of Africa, the Middle East, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific.Increased global population mobility increased the possibility of establishing vector transmission to areas where Chagas disease was previously non-endemic, especially in Asia, where the vector is naturally abundant, and even infest houses in large numbers."
How is Chagas disease transmitted?,"In the Region of the Americas, T. cruzi is mainly transmitted to humans through the infected faeces of the blood-sucking triatomine bug, which is the disease vector. This insect normally hides during the day and becomes active at night, when it feeds on human blood.In its search for a blood meal, the bug usually bites an exposed area of the skin (such as the face - hence its common English name, “kissing bug”).Right after its blood meal, it defecates close to the bite. The parasite, T.cruzi found in the faeces of the bug, is transmitted when the person rubs the area of the bite in an instinctive reaction to the itch (caused by the bite), thereby putting the faeces in contact with the bite.The parasite can also be transmitted when the parasite comes in contact with the mucous membrane of the eyes or mouth or through any other skin lesion.Transmission can occur through contaminated food infected with the vector’s faecal matter. This frequently generates oral outbreaks, especially in hot and humid climates.Other means of transmission involve transfusion of contaminated blood and from infected mothers to child during pregnancy or during delivery (congenital transmission). Less frequently, organ transplantation or laboratory accident can result in transmission.Outside the Region of the Americas, transmission does not occur through the faeces of the infected vector, but rather through non-vectorial routes.Cases of infection outside Latin America have been reported among travellers returning from endemic regions, adopted children and migrants.Globalisation and increased international travel and trade between endemic and non-endemic countries make Chagas Diseases a growing concern at the global level."
What are the symptoms of Chagas disease?,"Chagas disease has two successive phases: an acute phase and a chronic phase.Most acute phases are asymptomatic or have non-specific symptoms.During the chronic phase patients may also be symptom-free but some may progress to clinical forms of the disease (cardiac, digestive and/or neurological), which can be life threatening if left undiagnosed and untreated.Initial acute phaseThe initial acute phase lasts for about two months after infection. During this phase, a high number of parasites circulate in the blood. In most cases, symptoms are absent or mild, but may include fever, headache, enlarged lymph glands, pallor, muscle pain, cough, difficulty in breathing, liver enlargement , generalized body swelling, diarrhoea, heart inflammation (with chest pain and even heart failure) and, less frequently, meningoencephalitis (with seizures and even paralysis).In less than 50% of people bitten by a triatomine bug, characteristic first visible signs can be a skin lesion (chagoma) or a purplish swelling of the lids of one eye (Romaña sign).The acute phase can occur at any age but is frequently more severe in children aged <2 years, the ederly and in people who are immunosuppressed or in individuals infected with a high number of parasites. Meningoencephalitis is the most frequent manifestion in people suffering from AIDS.Chronic phaseThe acute phase is followed by the chronic phase, during which parasites are hidden mainly in the heart and digestive muscle.Different clinical forms may be observed:the indeterminate form, the most frequent form, asymptomatic and without apparent signs of disease, is typically found immediately after the acute phase and is life-long in most patients;the cardiac form occurs in up to a third of patients, affecting the heart’s electrical conduction system, causing arrhythmia, heart muscle disorder, heart failure and embolisms;the digestive form (generally enlargement of the oesophagus and/or the colon), observed in the South of the Amazon basin, ora mixed form that affects the heart, the digestive system and the autonomic nervous system occurs in ≤15% of patients.Depending on cardiac damage, the mortality rate in a period of 10 years may range from 9 to 85%. Patients usually die, by frequency order, from sudden death caused by arrhythmias, heart failure and vascular cerebral accident, often in early adult life."
How is Chagas disease diagnosed?,"During the acute phase or during reactivation because of immunosuppression (which can be caused by old age, radiation, chemotherapy or AIDS), diagnosis is made by direct detection of the parasite circulating in the bloodstream. To this end a blood wet smear or a blood concentration technique such as microhaematocrit or Strout technique, must be used.Stained preparations, such as malaria films, detect the parasites when parasitaemia is high (acute phase). In the Amazon Basin, microscopy technicians who diagnose malaria have been trained to detect acute individual cases of Chagas disease and, through them, identify possible foodborne outbreaks.During the chronic phase, when the parasite is hidden in target tissues, diagnosis is made via the detection of antibodies against T. cruzi (serological techniques) using serological tests. Some of the most frequently used techniques are: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect haemagglutination assay, indirect immunofluorescence assay, western blot and rapid diagnostic tests such as immunochromatography.For strict research purposes, molecular tests (qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and parasitological tests (haemoculture and xenodiagnosis – with examination of the faeces of uninfected triatomine bugs that have fed from an infected patient’s blood) may also be used."
What is the treatment against Chagas disease?,"Treatment is urgently indicated for anyone during the acute phase and for those in whom the infection has been reactivated (immunosuppression). In these situations, treatment is almost 100% effective, and the disease can be completely cured.However, efficacy decreases as the duration of the infection lengthens. Moreover, infants are less likely to have adverse events from treatment but this risk increases with age.Treatment is also indicated for infants with congenital infection and for patients during the early chronic phase.Adults, especially those with the indeterminate form of the disease, should be offered treatment, but its potential benefits in preventing or delaying the development of Chagas disease should be weighed against the long duration and frequent adverse events.During the late chronic phase, when cardiac or digestive manifestations may occur, additional lifelong medical treatment and surgery are usually indicated.As described earlier, the two medicines used for treatment are benznidazole, often the first-line treatment in most countries; and, nifurtimox. The main contraindications to treatment are pregnancy and kidney or liver failure. Nifurtimox is contraindicated in patients with a history of psychiatric or neurological disorders.Nifurtimox is free of charge through WHO-Bayer agreement.For ordering, please contact :Albajar Viñas P., Tel.:+41 22 791 1261,[email protected];Jourdan S., Tel.:+41 22 791 2498, [email protected];Akintunde D., Tel: +41 22 791 1084, [email protected].Benznidazole is produced by Laboratorio ELEA S.A.C.I.F.yA.,Sanabria 2353, C1417AZE, Ciudad de Buenos Aires,Argentina,Tel.: +54-11-43794300,Neglected Diseases Department,[email protected] and/or http://www.elea.com/en/contacto"
How to prevent Chagas disease?,"There is no vaccine to prevent Chagas disease.However, the following prevention and control tools are useful depending on the geographical area(s) affected:insecticide spraying of houses and surrounding areas;home improvements to prevent vector infestation (such as plastering walls, and installing concrete floors and corrugated iron roofs);good hygiene practices in food preparation, transportation, storage and consumption;personal preventive measures such as bednets;screening of blood donors;testing of organ, tissue and cell donors and receivers;observance of the standard safety protocols (wearing laboratory coats, gloves, face masks, caps and glasses) for laboratory accidents preventionAdditionally, key tools of congenital transmission control are the screening of infected pregnant women and the early detection of possible infection in neonates (secondary prevention) and their siblings to provide early diagnosis and treatment.The diagnosis of an infected newborn can be made at birth by detecting parasites directly in the umbilical cord or venous blood of the baby or when the infant is aged 8 months by detecting antibodies against T. cruzi.In areas where malaria is also transmitted, a system of surveillance for Chagas disease has been recently implemented. Malaria microscopy technicians have been trained to identify T. cruzi parasites in malaria films and detect acute Chagas disease in individual cases. Through them, possible foodborne outbreaks and active transmission areas for the disease may be also detected and controlled."
Why are Chagas disease diagnosis indexes low?,"The present low diagnosis indexes are strongly related to psychosocial rather than biomedical challenges. Among others, the following are well described determinants:Stigma - Forgotten disease or forgotten population? (Pinto Dias)For a long time, Chagas disease was a strictly found in rural areas, plaguing only certain regions of the countryside, usually characterized by poverty and exclusion.To many, Chagas disease symbolises much more than an illness, almost always associated with poverty in rural areas and impoverished house infested with triatomine bugs.Although the epidemiology of Chagas disease has changed because of migration and globalization, it is still associated with the poverty-stricken hut. Today, the disease is found in cities but the social stigma associated with infection remains strong.The social consequences of stigma can be extremely severe; indeed, infection with T. cruzi can lead to social rejection. Infection can also mean work restriction because its association with poor health and potential difficulties in performing work, and even sudden death, creating a fear of financial losses by employers. For these reasons many people are reluctant to seek screening and medical help, which can lead to more serious complications and further spread of the disease.Emotional Burden of Chagas DiseaseStudies have shown that local communities in endemic countries do not have a clear understanding of Chagas disease. Instead people in rural areas merge preconceptions, forging an overall mixed and incorrect concept of the disease, its origin and consequences.For many, Chagas disease is not necessarily associated with its vector or its symptoms, but more with feelings of despair, fear of death and suffering.This negative approach drastically affects health-seeking behaviour as people develop adaptive behaviours, such as refusing to get screened thereby compromising both treatment and diagnosis.Chagas disease diagnosis in non-endemic countriesGlobalisation has led to a rise in awareness about Chagas disease as an emerging issue in non-endemic regions.However, many practitioners in non-endemic countries still consider Chagas disease to be a tropical illness restricted to Latin America, and this assumption causes many misdiagnoses when presented with cardiomyopathies or other clinical manifestations of the disease.Similarly, patients infected with T.cruzi in non-endemic countries may not be aware of their condition which can lead to further transmission through blood and organs donation, for instance.Training health personnel to facilitate diagnosis and provide medical care can greatly help to mitigate transmission and improve prognosis.Regulatory practices in some countries require people applying for employment to go through a compulsory T.cruzi serology. Although the aim is to protect patients with Chagas disease, this practice has resulted in discrimination against infected individuals., causing instead, hindrance and stigmatization.Lack of understanding and knowledge of the disease, along with incorrect beliefs, are clear obstacles to promoting health-seeking behaviour."
What is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?,"Although relatively few people have heard of it, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) kills on average one person every 
10 seconds.
		COPD is not one single disease but an umbrella term used to 
describe chronic lung diseases that cause limitations in lung airflow. 
It is not a simple smoker's cough, but an under-diagnosed, life 
threatening lung disease. The most common symptoms of COPD are 
breathlessness, or a 'need for air', excessive sputum production, and a 
chronic cough. Daily activities, such as walking up a short flight of 
stairs, may become very difficult as the disease worsens. COPD is preventable, but not curable. Treatment can help slow 
disease progression, but COPD generally worsens slowly over time.  
Because of this, it is most frequently diagnosed in people aged 40 years
 or older. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are terms that are no longer
 used and are now included within the COPD diagnosis.According to WHO estimates, 64 million people have COPD and 3 
million people died of COPD in 2004. Total deaths from COPD are 
projected to increase in the next 20 years, making it the third leading 
cause of death in the world unless urgent action is taken to reduce 
underlying risk factors, especially tobacco use and air pollution."
What can I do to avoid a heart attack or a stroke?,"WHO estimates that more than 17.5 million people died of 
cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke in 2012. Contrary
 to popular belief, more than 3 out of 4 of these deaths occurred in 
low- and middle-income countries, and men and women were equally 
affected.
		The good news, however, is that 80% of premature heart attacks
 and strokes are preventable. Healthy diet, regular physical activity, 
and not using tobacco products are the keys to prevention. Checking and 
controlling risk factors for heart disease and stroke such as high blood
 pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar or diabetes is also 
very important.Eat a healthy diet: A balanced diet is crucial to a 
healthy heart and circulation system. This should include plenty of 
fruit and vegetables, whole grains, lean meat, fish and pulses with 
restricted salt, sugar and fat intake. Alcohol should also be used in 
moderation.Take regular physical activity: At least 30 minutes of 
regular physical activity every day helps to maintain cardiovascular 
fitness; at least 60 minutes on most days of the week helps to maintain 
healthy weight.Avoid tobacco use: Tobacco in every form is very 
harmful to health - cigarettes, cigars, pipes, or chewable tobacco. 
Exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke is also dangerous. The risk of 
heart attack and stroke starts to drop immediately after a person stops 
using tobacco products, and can drop by as much as half after 1 year.Check and control your overall cardiovascular risk: An 
important aspect of preventing heart attacks and strokes is by providing
 treatment and counselling to individuals at high risk (those with a 10 
year cardiovascular risk equal to or above 30%) and reducing their 
cardiovascular risk. A health worker can estimate your cardiovascular 
risk using simple risk charts and provide the appropriate advice for 
managing your risk factors.Know your blood pressure: High blood pressure usually has 
no symptoms, but is one of the biggest causes of sudden stroke or heart 
attack. Have your blood pressure checked and know your numbers. If it is
 high, you will need to change your lifestyle to incorporate a healthy 
diet with less salt intake and increase physical activity, and may need 
medications to control your blood pressure.Know your blood lipids: Raised blood cholesterol and 
abnormal blood lipids increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. 
Blood cholesterol needs to be controlled through a healthy diet and, if 
necessary, by appropriate medications.Know your blood sugar: Raised blood glucose (diabetes) 
increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes. If you have diabetes it
 is very important to control your blood pressure and blood sugar to 
minimize the risk."
Will the standards be applicable to all children?,"The standards describe normal child growth from birth to 5 years under optimal environmental conditions and can be applied to all children everywhere, regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status and type of feeding."
What reference data should be used for children older than 5 years?,"Please see “WHO Reference 2007 for boys and girls, 5-19 years at https://www.who.int/growthref/en/."
Why are new standards needed?,"Since the late 1970s, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO growth reference has been in use which describes how children grow in a particular region and time. This reference was based on data from several samples of children from a single
    country and suffers from a number of technical and biological drawbacks that make it inadequate to monitor the rapid and changing rate of early childhood growth.Under the leadership of WHO, the United Nations in 1993 undertook a comprehensive review of the uses and interpretation of child growth references. The review concluded that it was time to develop new standards that show how children should grow in all
    countries rather than merely describing how they grew at a particular time and place.Following this review, in 1994, the World Health Assembly (WHA) endorsed the development of a new set of tools to assess infant and young child growth. The Assembly stressed the need to move beyond past approaches and toward the more desirable goal of
    describing how all children should grow when their needs are met.In setting this ambitious goal, WHO and its principal partner, the United Nations University, in collaboration with a number of academic institutions worldwide, undertook the Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS), a community-based, multi-country
    project to develop new growth standards for infants and young children.The study involved the recruitment of children who met a number of health criteria in 6 countries representing different regions of the world: Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, and the United States. The 8,440 children included in the study were raised
    in environments that minimized constraints to growth such as poor diets and infection. In addition, their mothers followed health practices such as breastfeeding their children and not smoking during and after pregnancy."
How different are the new standards from the old growth charts?,"The new standards differ from any existing growth charts in a number of innovative ways. First, the MGRS was designed to provide data that describe “how children should grow,” by including in the study’s selection criteria specific health
    behaviours that are consistent with current health promotion recommendations (e.g., breastfeeding norms, standard pediatric care, non-smoking requirements). This new approach is fundamentally different from that taken by the traditional descriptive references. By adopting a prescriptive approach, the protocol’s design went beyond an update of how children in presumably healthy populations grow at a
    specific time and place and explicitly recognize the need for standards (i.e., devices that enable value judgments by incorporating norms or targets in their construction). Arguably, the current obesity epidemic in many developed countries would
    have been detectable earlier if a prescriptive international standard had been available 20 years ago.Another key characteristic of the new standard is that it makes breastfeeding the biological “norm” and establishes the breastfed infant as the normative growth model. The previous reference was based on the growth of artificially-fed children.The pooled sample from the 6 participating countries will allow the development of a truly international standard (in contrast to the previous international reference based on children from a single country) and reiterate the fact that child populations
    grow similarly across the world’s major regions when their needs for health and care are met.These standards also include new innovative growth indicators beyond height and weight that are particularly useful for monitoring the increasing epidemic of childhood obesity, such as the skinfold thickness. The study’s longitudinal nature will also allow the development of growth velocity standards. Health care providers will not have to wait until children cross an attained growth threshold to make the diagnosis of under-nutrition and overweight since
    velocity standards will enable the early identification of children in the process of becoming under- or over-nourished. Lastly, the development of accompanying windows of achievement for six key motor development milestones will provide a unique link between physical growth and motor development."
Do these new standards change current estimates of overweight and undernutrition in children?,"Yes, estimates are going to change because of differences in the pattern of growth between the new standards and the old reference, especially during infancy. The magnitude of the change in the estimates however will vary by age, sex, growth indicator,
    and the underlying nutritional status in the population being evaluated.A notable effect is that stunting (low height for age) will be greater throughout childhood when assessed using the new WHO standards compared to the previous international reference. There will be a substantial increase in underweight rates during the first half of infancy (i.e., 0-6 months) and a decrease thereafter. For wasting (low weight for length/height), the main difference between the new standards and the old reference is during infancy (i.e., up to about 70 cm length) when wasting rates will be substantially higher using the new WHO standards. With respect
    to overweight, use of the new WHO standards will result in a greater prevalence that will vary by age, sex and nutritional status of the index population."
What needs to be done/addressed/changed/improved so that all children grow well according to these standards?,"Breastfeeding should be supported, protected, and promoted. For the first 6 months, mothers need to be informed and empowered to practice exclusive breastfeeding. Children should be provided safe, wholesome, and nutritionally appropriate foods during the period of complementary feeding and after the second year when breastfeeding has ceased. Sound nutritional practices are important throughout childhood.      Appropriate national guidelines should be developed to aid caregivers in choosing nutritious local foods incorrect combinations and amounts to feed their children in order to maintain optimal growth in later childhood      (the aim being to avoid both nutritional deficiencies and excesses).Vaccinations and good health care should be available and accessible to all infants and young children. Families and their communities should do all they can to ensure that mothers have a good pregnancy.Nationally, full implementation of the objectives of the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding (2002) would go a long way in creating supportive environments for mothers to breastfeed their children. The new standard can help stimulate change that facilitates these improvements. Therefore, the very first step should be implementing the new standard in every country and ensuring that every child has his/her own chart against which his/her growth is assessed followed by an appropriate follow-up."
Which cut-offs should we use for defining obesity risk in children?,"Please seeM. de Onis, T Lobstein. Defining obesity risk status in the general childhood population: Which cut-offs should we use? International Journal of Pediatric Obesity 2010;5:458-60."
Is harmful use of alcohol a public health problem?,"Yes, the harmful use of alcohol is an important public health problem. It impacts people and societies in many ways. 
		It is well known that there is a causal relationship  between 
alcohol consumption and a range of mental and behavioural disorders, 
including alcohol dependence, other noncommunicable conditions such as 
liver diseases, some cancers, cardiovascular diseases, as well as  
injuries resulting from violence and road accidents. Furthermore, there 
are causal relationships between harmful use of alcohol and incidence of
 infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and pneumonia, as well as the 
course of HIV/AIDS. More than this, harmful use of alcohol creates 
considerable negative health and social consequences for people other 
than the drinker.

Current estimates of alcohol-related diseases only partly 
reveal the impact of harmful alcohol use. Accumulating evidence suggests
 a link between harmful use of alcohol and such infectious diseases as 
HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Such relationships have to be proven and 
quantified before global burden of disease estimates attributable to 
alcohol can be adjusted accordingly. Harmful use of alcohol is a causal factor in more than 200 
diseases and injuries. In 2012, 5.1% of the global disease burden was 
due to the harmful use of alcohol, and an estimated 3.3 million people 
died  from alcohol related conditions that year.  
Beyond health consequences, the harmful use of alcohol brings 
significant social and economic losses to individuals and society at 
large. In countries with lower economic wealth the morbidity and 
mortality risks are higher per litre of pure alcohol consumed than in 
the higher income countries."
What are SLCPs?,"Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), found in ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution, produce strong climate change effects but only remain in the atmosphere briefly –for a few days to about a decade. The short life span of SLCPs means that assertive action now to reduce emissions can rapidly improve both air quality as well as slowing the rate of near-term climate change.The main SLCPs of direct concern to health include black carbon (or ‘soot’), methane and ozone, which all contribute to both health-harmful air pollution and global warming. . Black carbon (BC) makes up a significant portion of fine particulate matter, the air pollutant most associated with premature death and morbidity. Ozone has significant adverse impacts on respiratory health, and methane contributes to ozone formation. Mitigation experts believe that firm actions reducing SLCP emissions could slow the pace of climate change by as much as .5⁰ C over the next few decades. Even so, it is important to note that SLCP reduction measures complement, but do not replace, the actions needed to reduce longer-lived CO2 emissions for climate stabilization."
Where do these pollutants come from?,"Open fires, (including wildfires, deliberate forest/brush burning, and burning of urban and crop waste), comprise the largest single source of black carbon emissions. Fuel combustion in residential and commercial buildings, as well as transport, account for approximately 80% of black carbon emissions from human activities related to energy production and use. Emissions from diesel, biomass and kerosene combustion are among the sources with the heaviest black carbon concentrations, and accordingly have been identified as priority sources for reducing emissions that contribute to near-term climate change.Particulate emissions from other sources, such as coal-fired power plants, are also a source of black carbon emissions, but here BC is co-emitted with other pollutants that have a climate “cooling” effect so that mitigation in this sector would have less of an impact on near-term climate change. In health terms, however, mitigation efforts that reduce fine particulates from other sources can, of course, be beneficial, and may also may reduce CO2 and thus longer term climate change.Ozone is not emitted directly but develops when a number of “precursor” pollution emissions interact in the presence of sunlight. Precursor emissions often include; methane, oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds, and carbon monoxide. Ozone is the second SLCP that causes adverse respiratory effects, with impacts ranging from changes in lung function and increased incidence of asthma to premature mortality. Methane is a powerful SLCP in and of itself, mainly produced from the agriculture sector, including livestock production, waste sector, and as a byproduct of fossil fuel extraction and distribution. Methane emissions impact on health through their role in ozone formation."
What is the impact of SCLPs on health?,"Since SLCPs contribute to ambient levels of ozone and PM2.5, SCLP emissions are directly associated with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including heart disease, pulmonary disease, respiratory infections and lung cancer. SLCP emissions thus contribute significantly to the more than 7 million premature deaths annually linked to air pollution.Indirectly, the SLCPs ozone and black carbon reduce plant photosynthesis and growth, thus decreasing agricultural yields, which in turn threatens food security. They also affect weather patterns and the melting of snow and ice, which may harm and endanger health through extreme weather events such as floods."
Can SLCP emissions be reduced?,"Yes, SLCPs are emitted from a variety of sources in the transport, agriculture, waste management, residential and industrial sectors, so there a range of mitigation opportunities that exist that can be highly beneficial for health. In fact, addressing SLCPs has distinct advantages insofar as health benefits from many measures can be enjoyed in the near term, and along with slowing the rate of near-term climate change, measures can be very complementary with longer-term CO2 emissions reductions required to reduce long-term climate change. So these are ‘win-win’ policies for the health, environment and climate sectors."
What are the mitigation actions?,"The report covers many different strategies, providing indicative “ratings” of potential health and SLCP mitigation benefits for 19. The CO2 reduction potential of the same strategies was also considered, since SLCP mitigation is seen as complementary to mitigation of CO2 emissions required to stabilize climate and ensure the health of future generations. Four strategies were identified which appear to have the largest aggregate potential for health and SLCP mitigation benefits as well as reducing CO2.Policies and investments that prioritize dedicated rapid transit and walking and cycling networks in compact cities can promote health in multiple ways, including reduced air pollution exposures, reduced injury risks and greater opportunities for safe active travel.Encouraging healthier diets rich in plant-based foods and low in red and processed meats among affluent populations at risk of a range of diet-related noncommunicable diseases will have a positive effect on health and will also reduce emissions.Provide and promote the use of clean and efficient cook-stoves and fuels, and cleaner energy sources, to the approximately 2.8 billion low-income households that currently rely on solid fuels for heating and cooking.Reducing vehicle emissions of both particulate matter as well as ozone precursors (e.g. NO2) by implementing stricter vehicle and fuel emissions and efficiency standards.Along with these four, however, many other SLCP measures identified in this report are also very beneficial to health. Examples include improved waste management strategies, more energy efficient homes and buildings, phasing out kerosene lamps and greater reliance on clean light and power sources, using including renewable energy, for homes and health clinics, cleaner brick industries and coke ovens, etc. Measures outlined can reduce many other types of health risks, ranging from: housing related diseases associated with exposure to extreme heat, cold or damp; sanitation-related diseases; air pollution from kerosene and generator fumes; work-related diseases, and so on.. These approaches are also discussed in detail, by sector."
In what ways will reducing emissions be beneficial for health?,"In summary, there are three key ways in which reducing emissions of SLCPs can provide health benefits:directly, it will reduce air pollution exposures and related diseases;indirectly, the negative effects that ozone and black carbon have on weather and food production, which affect food security, will be reduced;As a result of certain SLCP mitigation actions, such as improved transport systems, healthier diets, or better waste management, there other health benefits may also be obtained, such as improved chances for physical activity, less risk of traffic injury, reduced risks of diet-related chronic diseases, or reduced exposure to waste and sanitation-related health risks."
Why should we act now?,"There is increasing evidence that direct exposure to certain SLCPs is associated with ill-health. As their name indicates, SLCPs have a short life-span in the atmosphere, which means that once emissions are reduced they disappear relatively quickly and health benefits begin to occur soon after and in some cases almost immediately. Another important feature is that benefits will occur near where mitigation takes place, directly benefitting the health of communities. Therefore, controlling emissions of these SLCPs or their precursors could save lives through improved air quality, reduce expected warming by .5⁰C or more over the next few decades and contribute to food security."
Why is it important for policymakers?,"Health benefits from SLCP mitigation measures in the communities where actions are taken and in the near-term, making them particularly attractive from a policy standpoint.Mitigation measures are highly compatible with the immediate development priorities of local and national policymakers since they reduce harmful air pollution, make cities healthier and more attractive to live and work, and also provide greater opportunities for healthier lifestyles.The short lifespan of SLCPs means that once emissions are reduced, benefits begin to occur very soon after actions are taken."
What can I do?,"Some simple lifestyle choices coming from individuals can have potential benefits for reducing emissions and contributing to better health. Although policy decisions make up a big part for mitigation actions, the choices we make on what we eat, how we travel, and the energy sources we use, for example, choosing to take public transport over private cars and being active by walking or cycling will contribute to the reduction of emissions and noise pollution while increasing health and well-being."
What else is being addressed?,"There are other benefits of reducing SLCP emissions. Aside from the large benefits for public health, many of the health-enhancing strategies for reducing SLCP emissions can also lead to substantial co-reductions in CO2 emissions and therefore, help mitigate both near- and long-term climate change."
"What is this report on ""Personal interventions and risk communication on air pollution"" about ?","This report presents the results of an expert consultation whose objectives were to review and
assess the current scientific evidence on questions related to protection measures that individuals can take (or so-called personal interventions) to reduce their exposure to air pollution. Such
measures include wearing respirators, using indoor portable air filters (cleaners) or avoiding certain places and limiting activities or exercising in an environment with high levels of air pollution. It
was agreed, however, that these measures are the least desirable choice in the hierarchy of interventions - the most preferred being public policies aiming at reducing emissions. The report also
discusses the communication challenges associated to information related to air pollution and health
impacts, such as air pollution sources, Air Quality Index (AQI), and the role of medical societies."
What should policy makers do to protect citizen from air pollution?,"The best way to protect people from the harmful effects of air pollution is to bring concentrations of air pollutants down to those recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines, through
pollutant emission monitoring, land-use and urban planning, and sustainable consumption.

Policy makers and citizens need to know the sources of air pollutants and their contributions to air
pollution in each location, and this information should guide effective emission control strategies.
One of the most significant pollutants, particulate matter (PM2.5), can originate from a wide range
of sources and can be spread over several hundreds of kilometres, illustrating the importance of
national and regional cooperation to recognizing and addressing the specific sources and combatting air pollution efficiently."
What are effective ways to communicate about air pollution and health?,"Successful communication approaches to policy makers and administrations should underline
the importance of source apportionment, emission control of the sources, population weighted
exposure as a guidance of the interventions, the importance of regional in addition to local policies,
and the relevance of the co-benefits of other policies (e.g. climate mitigation). The public should
be informed about the complexity of the issue and of the relative importance of the sources.
Successful communication approaches to the public should include communication on local,
personal, feasible actions that can be undertaken by individuals to mitigate air pollution. People are
motivated by a sense of self-efficacy and neglect hazards that they cannot reduce.

However, communication strategies should be tailored to the geography, economic conditions,
culture, expectations and norms in each setting. Messages should be specific for the general public
and for sensitive individuals. Help in adapting messages can be provided by social structures such
as schools and other educational facilities, local and regional administrative structures, and institutions of the civil society, such as patients organizations, professional societies, and specific interest
groups. Trust in expert knowledge should be built by issuing publicly accessible information on
facts, evidence and peer-reviewed data and results."
What is an air pollution or quality index?,"An air quality index (AQI), or Air quality and health index (AQHI) or Air pollution index (API) is a
common tool for the reporting and communication of the state of air quality at the city or at regional
level on as short-term basis. Ideally, it expresses air quality in easily understood terms. AQI is also used
to make recommendations aimed at reducing air pollution exposure and to provide health advisories to
members of the public, including those who are more vulnerable to adverse air pollution exposures."
How is an air pollution or quality index calculated?,"An AQI generally includes more than one pollutant and provides, with a simple scheme
(for example using colours), a grading of the current air quality.

It is most often reported on an hourly basis. Nearly all indices are set as ratios to predetermined
thresholds based on either regulatory or recommended levels, which are locally or nationally set.
However, few indices are based on rigorous health-based evidence."
Can different AQIs be compared?,"There is currently no harmonized method for calculating AQI. As the methodology and chosen
thresholds vary by country, AQIs are intrinsically not valuable for international comparisons.
Indeed, they can be quite misleading when used in this way.
It is advised that all jurisdictions also report the actual measurement data in normal units (e.g. μg/
m3) for all included pollutants in addition to their local AQI, including which pollutant is contribu-
ting the most, as people may be sensitive to different pollutants."
How useful are AQIs?,"An AQI is useful if by providing relevant timely air quality information to the public and vulnerable
groups, it can reduce exposure to air pollution through individual behaviour modification, while public authorities ensure a timely reduction of emissions activities. These interventions by their very
nature are only used sporadically, therefore their effectiveness depends on whether individuals
have information that is applicable, reliable, and understandable and if relevant actions are feasible
in the affected population.

Often, these indices summarize several air pollutant concentrations in one number, which makes it
difficult to isolate the effect of one specific pollutant. For example, in some cases the same index
can result from a combination of low particle and high ozone exposure or a combination of high
particle and low ozone concentration. As patients are often not affected by all pollutants, a combined index makes it more difficult to react accordingly.

Even indices that have been specifically designed based on health research have been mostly based
on long term population-level health risks. Therefore, they are not designed to capture short term risk increases to especially vulnerable groups, such as babies or respiratory disease patients."
Who is more at risk of air pollution?,"Two groups of people are at a higher risk from air pollution than the general population. People
who are more susceptible have an increased response to exposure to air pollution. This increased
response comes from an innate or acquired predisposition, such as pre-existing conditions or
diseases. Moreover, some people are more vulnerable, which means they have an increased
exposure, which is due to external factors such as place of residence, type of occupation, or
internal factors such as increased ventilation (children), etc.
While one can argue that almost everyone may fit into one of these categories, the following categories
are generally considered more at risk:People with pre-existing conditions (e.g. cardiorespiratory)Children & Pregnant womenElderlyOutdoor workersIt is particularly important for pregnant women, children and old people and patients with cardio-
vascular, cerebrovascular or respiratory disease to reduce short-term exposure (hours to weeks) to
air pollution. Reducing long-term exposure (weeks to year) is important for everybody."
Should susceptible or vulnerable people be recommended personal interventions?,"Some evidence exists for children and people with cardiorespiratory conditions to recommend
clinicians to provide guidance about the health risks of air pollution and behavioral aspects
such as avoidance or reduction of pollution exposure, physical activity and personal protection.
Yet, prioritization of risk and unintended consequences need to be balanced."
Are specific recommendations on reducing exposure during major air pollution episodes useful in protecting health?,"Public health recommendations aiming at reducing exposure to decrease risk of acute harm often
occur during major pollution episodes, however, greatest health benefit is likely to happen when
exposure reduction occurs on in the long run, reducing risk of chronic harm.
Providing recommendations to avoid or reduce exposure may not always be possible or even
advisable depending on individual circumstances. However, modifying the location, timing, and type
of outdoor activity can greatly modify pollution exposures since the levels of air pollutants vary both
spatially and temporally."
Should people remain indoors during a major air pollution episode?,"Avoiding air pollution through staying indoors may be beneficial but the effect largely depends on
the level of indoor exposure. There are many potential sources of indoor air pollution – such as
cooking, active and passive smoking, incense burning – in addition to the infiltration of air pollutants from outdoors to indoors, which in turn is a function of many factors (e.g. type of ventilation,
building specificities, etc.). During acute episodes of air pollution, emergency interventions may be applied by local authorities, including school closures and limitation of sports events, as part of a risk management
strategy. However: the reduction in exposure of populations and the health benefits of these
interventions are not clear or may be reversed, depending on various circumstances, and the
potential benefits and harms should be quantified with more research."
What are the links between air pollution and physical activity?,"Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that require
energy expenditure. Popular ways to be active are through walking, cycling, sports and recreation
or any activities undertaken while working, playing, or carrying out household chores.
Physical activity has significant health benefits and contributes to prevent non-communicable
diseases. On the other hand, physical activity may influence the uptake and deposit of air pollutants in the lungs and airways. At higher air pollutants concentrations, more air pollutants will be
inhaled. High air pollution levels may also prevent people from engaging in physical activity."
"Is it safe to exercise (either through occupation, active transport or recreational physical activity) when the levels of air pollutions are high?","Evidence on healthy adult populations in high-income countries advocates for regular physical activity, even if the air quality does not meet the levels recommended by WHO, as it provides health
benefits. However, scientific evidence is weak for all the examined associations in low and middle-
income countries (LMIC), for indoor settings (e.g. households, dedicated places for physical activity
practice), and for susceptible subpopulations (children, old, people with pre-existing conditions).

Specifically, evidence on short-term impacts suggest that air pollution diminishes (but not eliminate) the beneficial effects of physical activity, in populations with diseases such as cardiovascular
and respiratory conditions and for those who are healthy. In the long-term, studies suggest that
air pollution slightly reduces the protective effect of physical activity on mortality. Also, modelling
studies have estimated that in most situations, the benefits of physical activity should be larger
than risks of air pollution, at least in walking and cycling environments."
Should people at risk be advised to reduce their physical activity levels during air pollution episodes?,"In general, regular physical activity should be promoted even if the local air quality is not
optimal. Whenever possible, people should adapt the timing and location of physical activity to
reduce exposure to air pollution. Any recommendation should include consideration of ozone and
temperature levels, especially in warmer climates. Patients who take medication should follow
their physician’s recommendations.
Going by the precautionary principle, populations at specific risk (due to their health status
or occupation) should be advised about the best time and location for physical activity or for
work (e.g. outdoors) and to reduce moderate–vigorous physical or work outdoors during high air
pollution episodes.In addition to regional action, local action to reduce daily background air pollution should be
promoted in order to ensure physical activity under the best conditions for health."
What does the report say on portable air filters?,"Staying indoor is one way to reduce exposure from air pollution, provided that indoor air pollutants
are kept low. A systematic review of the literature about the efficacy of portable air filters (or por-
table air cleaners) in real-world situations (i.e. not in a laboratory or occupational setting) showed
that they are efficient to reduce indoor particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration by 40-82%.
As for the improvement of health effects, the results indicate some health improvements, and
mostly in healthy adults.
However, the few studies available in the literature that focused mostly on efficacy, only included
small number of participants - mostly health ones - and covered short-term time frames only.
Long-term studies on susceptible population to air pollution impacts are lacking."
Can air filters be recommended as a public health measure?,"It would be premature to recommend the use of portable air filters as a public health measure for
three reasons :

There is a lack of information on effectiveness in the real world, which depends on rates of
    infiltration of outdoor air pollutants into the indoor environment and human activities.
They may have adverse indoor and environmental impact, such as build-up of gaseous pollutants either generated indoors, like ozone produced by some electrostatic filters or due to
    sealing measures (e.g. closing windows) for CO2, and noise.
The high cost of maintenance (e.g. changing filters) and equitable access issues need to be
    considered as limiting factors.

 
The use of portable air filters might be proposed for people with preexisting conditions, such as
COPD, heart failure or lung transplants, who should stay at home and be protected from exposure
to air pollution."
What is a respirator in the context of air pollution?,"A respirator is a mask that covers the nose and mouth and fits tightly to the face, which can filter
out PM2.5 particles, including smoke or ash particles. Respirators have primarily been developed
to protect workers in high exposure work places. Filtering facepiece respirators are made entirely
of filter material and are the most common type of air-purifying particulate respirators.

 
There are well-established occupational certifications, recommendations and protocols for respirator use. The general public should be cautious when purchasing products advertised online
that have not been assessed for conformity by e.g. Chinese National Standards (GB), European
Conformity (CE), the Japanese Industrial Standard or the US National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) standard. 



Respirators that are filtering 95% of airborne particle are called N95 (the most popular name)
in the USA following the NIOSH Standard but are called KN95 in China following the Chinese
National Standard, and FFP2 respirators in Europe following the European Conformity Standard.
These terms (e.g. N95 etc), which refer to the particle removal efficiency of respirators, has not
been patented or copyrighted and can be used by any maker of masks, even without proper testing. Packaging should be examined for certification or approval by a known national or international authority."
Can respirators protect from air pollution in the occupational setting?,"According to occupational recommendations and protocols, there are five factors that ensure that
a respirator is effective :

Putting it on correctly.
Ensuring that it fits properly.
Using it continuously during exposure.
Replacing the respirator or the filter when it becomes saturated.
Confirming that it has been approved to remove ≥ 95 % of particles.

 
Because of differences in facial structures across the world, no one respirator can be guaranteed
to fit all users. There are no commercial respirators designed for children (based on information
available as of February 2019). There is, to date. no information on the application of well-established occupational recommendations and protocols for respirator use by the public and who
should be the responsible authority on this.

 
When respirators are properly selected and used, they reduce exposure to harmful inhalation
pollutants. However, those with underlying medical conditions such as respiratory disease need to
be cautious, as these issues could be exacerbated when using a respirator."
Do respirators protect from air pollution in real world situations?,"A systematic review of the literature about the efficacy of respirators use in reducing exposure to
particulate matter in real-world situations (i.e. not in a laboratory or occupational setting) showed
little if any health improvements. However, there were few studies in the literature that focused
mostly on efficacy, and these only included small numbers of participants - mostly health ones –
and only covered short-term time frames. Most studies did not provide information on how well
the respirators worked or fitted, which might have biased the results. There is no evidence available
on the effectiveness of respirator use in the general population or on susceptible populations."
Can respirators be recommended as a public health measure?,"Given the limited evidence on the effectiveness of respirators to protect health in real conditions
of use by the general population, their use should not be recommended. Rather, the recommendation should be to continue and intensify action to reduce air pollutant emissions and to reduce
or limit every day exposure when possible. The use of respirators is recommended or required in specific occupational situations. In the
general population they may be recommended under well-controlled procedures for short periods
in situations such as wildfires, volcanic eruptions, acute desert dust episodes or clean-up after a
disaster. Here again, a special caution is necessary for people with respiratory and cardiovascular
disease for whom it may not be advisable to use a respirator due to increased dead space, airway
resistance and psychological stress."
How equitable is it to recommend personal interventions?,"Breathing clean air is a human right. Responsibility for the provision of clean air lies within the society
and must not be delegated to the individual, as the individual has very limited options of decreasing
her/his own exposure. Moreover, placing the responsibility for reducing exposure to air pollution on
individuals raises important issues of equity in terms of individuals’ need and opportunities/ability to
implement the recommendations due to differential access to information and resources.
Recommendations should account for the individual cultural, educational and socioeconomic
context, the resources available to follow those recommendations, the information available to
make an informed decision, people’s perceived risk of harm from air pollution as compared with
competing health risks and the basic human right to a sustainable livelihood.
Effective actions by authorities could ease the pressure on individuals to reduce their own expo-
sure. The actions include, most importantly, legislation to ensure clean air, but in the interim can
include subsidies to individuals in the greatest need, in terms of both reducing exposure to air
pollution and accessing resources, to implement the recommended interventions."
What is this the role of medical societies?,"Medical societies can play a central role in educating the public about the health effects of air pollution and in developing and distributing clinical guidelines, which might have to be region-specific
and with inequity properly addressed.

In guideline development and advocacy, medical societies should ensure that the responsibility for
providing a healthy environment is that of society, and every attempt to place the responsibility
on the individual must be prevented."
What are the main sources of household air pollution in developing countries?,"Nearly 3 billion of the world’s poorest still rely on solid fuels 
(wood, animal dung, charcoal, crop wastes and coal) burned in 
inefficient and highly polluting stoves for cooking and heating. The 
resulting household air pollution led to more than 4 million premature 
deaths among children and adults in 2012."
What are the health consequences?,"Of the 4.3 million people who die annually from exposure to 
household air pollutants, most perish from stroke (34%), ischaemic heart
 disease (26%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (22%). 
Pneumonia and lung cancer account for 12% and 6% of deaths, 
respectively. Women and young children, who spend the most time near the 
domestic hearth, are particularly vulnerable. More than 50% of pneumonia
 deaths among children under 5 are linked to household air pollution."
"Are there other consequences for development, beyond human health?","Polluting household fuels also endanger the health of the 
planet. Emissions of black carbon and methane from low-efficiency stoves
 contribute to outdoor air pollution and increase the rate of climate 
change.In many regions, fuel gathering for traditional stoves 
consumes considerable time for women and children, limiting other 
productive activities—such as generating income—and taking children away
 from school. Safe and efficient cooking stoves would reduce the 
workload for women and children and decrease the demand on scarce 
natural resources (eg. forests)."
Why is the population ageing?,"The ageing of the world's populations is the result of the 
continued decline in fertility rates and increased life expectancy. This
 demographic change has resulted in increasing numbers and proportions 
of people who are over 60. As a result, the first time in history when 
there will be more older people than younger people is rapidly 
approaching."
What issues related to ageing are WHO working on?,"WHO is working on three areas with a direct impact on ageing:prevention of chronic disease;access to age-friendly primary health care;
creation of age-friendly environments.
WHO has developed guidelines that help countries to understand
 the types of programmes they can put in place to improve healthcare 
settings and cities so they are better suited to the needs of older 
people. WHO supports networks where countries can share technical 
information, discuss strategies and policies that have worked in their 
country to improve the lives of older people."
What is WHO doing to increase our understanding of health and ageing?,"To increase our understanding of the health implications of 
ageing, particularly in less developed countries, WHO is undertaking the
 Study on global ageing and adult health (SAGE). This 
longitudinal follow-up of approximately 50 000 older adults is being 
carried out in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russian Federation and South
 Africa.  The study links a related international network of health and 
demographic surveillance: the Demographic evaluation of populations and their health
 (INDEPTH). Comparisons with similar studies in high income countries 
will provide opportunities to understand similarities and differences in
 the health and well being of older adults globally."
What roles do older people take on in society?,"Older persons work in a paid or unpaid capacity, care for family 
members and friends, and carry out after-retirement work in 
organizations and associations. They pass their experiences onto younger
 generations and by doing so, they help them strengthen their 
capacities. A high percentage of older people care for their 
grandchildren or other relatives and friends regularly and thus, in case
 of grandchildren, are supporting their children. In Africa, for 
example, family support of grandparents plays a particularly important 
role supporting children, as the parent's generation has been strongly 
impacted by the effects of HIV/AIDS.Related linkAgeing and life course"
What is gaming disorder?,"Gaming disorder is defined in the 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as a pattern of gaming behavior (“digital-gaming” or “video-gaming”) characterized by impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences.For gaming disorder to be diagnosed, the behaviour pattern must be of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning and would normally have been evident for at least 12 months."
What is the International Classification of Diseases?,The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the basis for identification of health trends and statistics globally and the international standard for reporting diseases and health conditions. It is used by medical practitioners around the world to diagnose conditions and by researchers to categorize conditions.The inclusion of a disorder in ICD is a consideration which countries take into account when planning public health strategies and monitoring trends of disorders.WHO released the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) in mid-2018.
Why is gaming disorder being included in ICD-11?,"A decision on inclusion of gaming disorder in ICD-11 is based on reviews of available evidence and reflects a consensus of experts from different disciplines and geographical regions that were involved in the process of technical consultations undertaken by WHO in the process of ICD-11 development. The inclusion of gaming disorder in ICD-11 follows the development of treatment programmes for people with health conditions identical to those characteristic of gaming disorder in many parts of the world,  and will result in the increased attention of health professionals to the risks of development of this disorder and, accordingly, to relevant prevention and treatment measures."
Should all people who engage in gaming be concerned about developing gaming disorder?,"Studies suggest that gaming disorder affects only a small proportion of people who engage in digital- or video-gaming activities. However, people who partake in gaming should be alert to the amount of time they spend on gaming activities,  particularly when it is to the exclusion of other daily activities, as well as to any changes in their physical or psychological health and social functioning that could be attributed to their pattern of gaming behaviour."
What is Cannabidiol and is it safe?,"Cannabidiol is one of several (probably 200) compounds of the cannabis plant.At its November 2017 meeting, the WHO Expert Committee on Drug
 Dependence (ECDD) concluded that, in its pure state, cannabidiol does 
not appear to have abuse potential or cause harm.  As such, as CBD is 
not currently a scheduled substance in its own right (only as a 
component of cannabis extracts), current information does not justify a 
change in this scheduling position and does not justify scheduling of 
the substance.However, where CBD is produced for pharmaceutical purposes as 
an extract of cannabis, cannabis extracts and tinctures are included in 
the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. A fuller review of 
extracts or preparations containing almost exclusively CBD will take 
place in June 2018, when the WHO expert committee will undertake a 
comprehensive review of cannabis and cannabis related substances.Not scheduling a substance means that it is not subject to 
strict international controls, including for production and supply.  Its
 legal status in countries is something for national legislators to 
decide. Some countries have eased regulations around cannabidiol, to 
consider products containing CBD to be medical products.  These include 
Australia, Canada, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United 
States of America."
What evidence is there that Cannabidiol has value for medical use?,"WHO does not recommend cannabidiol for medical use. Initial 
evidence from animal and human studies (i.e. a controlled study in the 
New England Journal of Medicine and other reported individual cases) 
shows that its use could have some therapeutic value for seizures due to
 epilepsy and related conditions.Some people have been using cannabidiol to calm spasms during 
epileptic fits.  The New England Journal of Medicine also published a 
study lately saying there is some evidence it may be effective during 
epileptic seizures.  This means it could have some medical use but more 
evidence is needed."
What is lead?,"Lead is a naturally occurring toxic metal found in the Earth’s crust. It has many uses, including in the manufacture of lead-acid batteries for motor vehicles and energy storage, in pigments and paints, solder, ammunition, ceramic glazes, jewellery, toys and also in some cosmetics and traditional medicines. Lead additives have almost entirely been phased out of gasoline for motor vehicles, however, lead continues to be used in some aviation fuels (Avgas) for piston-engine aircraft. The processing, use and disposal of lead can result in environmental contamination and human exposure. As lead is an element, once released into the environment it persists as a potential source of exposure."
What is lead poisoning?,"Lead poisoning refers to excessive human exposure to lead. Exposure can occur from inhalation of lead fumes and particles, e.g. from smelting, or from ingestion of lead-contaminated dust (e.g. from decaying lead paint), water (from leaded pipes) and food (from lead-glazed or lead-soldered containers). This exposure may occur over a short space of time (acute poisoning) or over a prolonged period (chronic poisoning). No level of exposure to lead that is without harmful effects has so far been identified. As a consequence, some health authorities define excessive exposure as having a blood lead concentration above the reference value for the population as a whole. This reference value is usually the blood lead concentration that characterises the top 2.5% or 5% of the population, i.e. the 97.5th or 95th percentile respectively. For example, in the USA a reference value of 5 µg/dL was established in 2012, based on the 97.5th percentile of blood lead concentrations observed in children under six years of age during the years 2008 to 2012 (1). In France 5 µg/dL is the 98th percentile value for children under seven years (2)."
What are the health effects of lead exposure?,"Lead has no biological function in the body. It accumulates in the body and affects practically all organ systems. Lead exposure can cause chronic and debilitating health impacts in all age groups, but it is particularly harmful to young children. This is because the developing nervous system is vulnerable to the toxic effects of lead, even at levels of exposure that do not cause obvious symptoms and signs. Lead exposure in early childhood can result in reduced cognitive abilities, dyslexia, attention deficit disorder and antisocial behaviour. Lead exposure can also cause hypertension, renal impairment, immunotoxicity and toxicity to the reproductive organs.Absorption of large amounts of lead can cause coma, convulsions and even death. Children who survive severe lead poisoning can be left with permanent neurological injury such as deafness and mental retardation. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has estimated that in 2017 lead exposure accounted for 1.06 million deaths and 24.4 million years lost to disability and death (disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)) worldwide due to long-term effects on health. The highest burden is in low- and middle-income countries.  IHME has also estimated that lead exposure accounted for 63.2% of the global burden of idiopathic developmental intellectual disability (i.e. intellectual disability not due to known causes such as genetic factors), 10.3% of the global burden of hypertensive heart disease, 5.6% of the global burden of ischaemic heart disease and 6.2% of the global burden of stroke (3)."
What are the costs associated with lead exposure?,"There are both direct and indirect economic costs resulting from lead exposure. These include health care costs in treating lead poisoning, social costs such as the need for special education to combat lead-induced intellectual impairment, and productivity losses because of reduced intelligence quotient (IQ). The estimated economic costs attributable to the neurodevelopmental impacts of childhood lead exposure amounted to 1.2% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011. Expressed in terms of loss to regional GDP, the estimated cost in Africa was 4.03%, in Latin America and the Caribbean 2.04%, and in Asia 1.88% (4)."
What are the sources of human exposure to lead?,"Lead has many uses; therefore, there are many potential sources of exposure. Important sources include environmental contamination from the recycling of lead acid batteries and from poorly controlled lead mining and smelting operations; the use of lead-containing traditional remedies; lead ceramic glazes used in food containers; lead pipes and other lead-containing components in water distribution systems, and lead paint. Leaded gasoline used to be an important source of exposure but almost all countries have now banned its use (5). The continued use of tetraethyl lead in some aviation fuels exposes populations around airfields to lead (6)."
How important are used lead-acid batteries as a source of lead exposure?,"Lead-acid batteries are used in motorized vehicles, for storage of energy generated by solar panels and wind turbines, and for back-up power supplies. The growth in the use of renewable energy sources and the concomitant need for storage batteries, as well as the increasing demand for motor vehicles as countries undergo economic development, mean that the demand for lead-acid batteries is continuing to increase. Approximately 85% of the total global consumption of lead is for the production of these batteries, and over half of this demand is met through recycling (7). Lead, as fumes, particles and dust, can be released at all stages of the battery recycling process, from draining and dismantling the batteries, to smelting and refining the lead. Environmental contamination from recycling can be extensive and can cause significant exposure to workers and to surrounding communities. People engaged in recycling, who do not wash and change their clothes before leaving work, can bring lead contamination home with them and expose household members. Preventing lead release requires the use of adequate engineering controls, trained staff, the provision of protective equipment, and the implementation of occupational and environmental standards. In many parts of the world where lead is recycled, these measures are not available or enforced. Informal, or ‘backyard’ recycling is widely practised in many low-income countries and has resulted in serious, and even fatal, lead poisoning (8,9)."
What is lead paint?,"In the context of action to eliminate lead paint, the term ‘paint’ includes varnishes, lacquers, stains, enamels, glazes, primers and other coatings. Paint is typically a formulated mixture of resins, pigments, fillers, solvents and other additives. Lead paint is paint to which one or more lead compounds have been added to confer specific properties such as colour, corrosion-resistance or to speed up drying. Lead compounds are primarily added to some solvent-based paints, such as enamel (gloss) paints. The lead content of paint can range from less than 90 ppm (90 mg/kg) to over 100 000 ppm (100 000 mg/kg). In paints with no added lead there may be a small amount present as a contaminant of the raw materials used in manufacture, but when a manufacturer takes care to source uncontaminated raw materials the lead content is usually well below 90 ppm. Lead paint data collected around the world shows that in every country where studies have been conducted, there are  paint companies  producing paint containing less than 90 ppm of lead. This demonstrates that eliminating lead in all paints is within the capability of local producers (10). Also, in most countries where no regulations are in place to restrict the use of lead paint, paint intended for household use with hazardous levels of lead is typically widely available on the market (10)."
Why is lead paint an important source of human exposure?,"Lead paint is still used in the majority of countries and, since the phase-out of leaded petrol, this paint is one of the largest sources of domestic exposure to lead for children. Intact lead paint is safe; however, as it ages the paint starts to decay, fragmenting into flakes and dust that contaminate the home environment. This aging process can be very fast in some climates. Paint flakes and dust are readily swallowed by young children who typically play on the ground and frequently put their hands to their mouths. Some children compulsively pick flakes of paint off surfaces and eat them. The removal of lead paint, for example during home renovation or maintenance of painted structures such as bridges, can also result in the release of lead-contaminated dust if it is not done in a safe manner. Lead paint can remain a source of exposure for many years into the future. Even in countries that banned lead paint decades ago there are still many homes where lead painted surfaces can be found. The sooner that lead paint is banned in a country the sooner this toxic legacy can be eliminated."
What are the economic costs of lead paint?,"Once lead paint has been applied in the home it becomes a potential source of lead exposure, particularly as the paint starts to age and decay. In France, while the number of children with blood lead concentrations above 10 µg/dL is now small, 74% of cases are associated with poor quality housing where there is lead paint (11). Older housing with lead paint has also been identified in the USA as a risk factor for elevated blood lead concentrations in children (12).Removing lead paint carries a cost, particularly as measures must be taken to prevent environmental contamination with lead during removal and disposal. In France, based on 2008 values, it was estimated that the cost of remediating all homes with lead paint would range from €133.1 million to €342.5 million (US$ 193.8–498.7 million at 2008 exchange rates) (11). In the USA the costs of remediating lead-painted homes inhabited by young children were estimated to range from US$ 1.2 billion to US$ 11.0 billion in 2009 (12).Cost-benefit analyses have indicated that investment in lead paint abatement yields large returns. In France the estimated net benefit was €3.78 billion (US$ 5.5 billion at 2008 exchange rates) (11). These benefits were calculated on the basis of avoided health costs for the management of lead exposure and avoided social costs e.g., in relation to reduced IQ, the need for special education, and lost lifetime earnings.  In the USA it has been estimated that each dollar invested in lead paint hazard control yields a return of US$ 17–221 (12).    Of course, the most cost-effective solution is to prevent the use of lead paint altogether. Eliminating the use of lead in paints does not need to be expensive and a number of manufacturers have already successfully reformulated products to avoid the intentional addition of lead (13)."
What is the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint and what are its aims?,"The Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint (the Lead Paint Alliance) is jointly led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in accordance with their respective mandates.  The Lead Paint Alliance is a voluntary collaborative initiative that aims to focus and catalyse the efforts of diverse stakeholders to achieve international goals to prevent children’s exposure, and to minimize occupational exposure, to lead from
    paint. Stakeholders include governments, intergovernmental organizations and non-state actors including civil society, regional bodies, philanthropic organizations, academia, media and the private sector. Interested individuals may also participate
    as stakeholders. The broad objective of the Lead Paint Alliance is to promote the phase-out of the manufacture and sale of paints containing lead and eventually to eliminate the risks that such paints pose.The background to the formation of the Lead Paint Alliance is the call by governments at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 for lead paint to be phased out. Progress on this issue was discussed at the second International Conference on
    Chemicals Management in 2009 (ICCM2). ICCM2 noted the success of the Partnership for Clean Fuels and Vehicles in phasing out the use of leaded gasoline and supported the establishment of a global partnership to promote the phase-out of lead paint.
    In 2015, the global elimination of lead paint by 2020 was re-affirmed as a global priority issue at the Fourth Session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM4).Click here for more information on the Lead Paint Alliance, including how
    to become a partner."
What can Member States do to eliminate lead in paint?,"There are safer alternatives to lead compounds for use as pigments and driers. These have been available for a number of years and studies have shown that using these alternatives does not significantly increase the cost of paint (13). There
    is, however, still a general lack of awareness on the issue of lead and an absence of mandatory standards for lead in paints in many countries. In countries where lead paint is still available, governments should introduce legally binding controls to either ban or restrict the use of lead paint. Examples of control measures include prohibiting the use of any lead compounds in paint or setting
    a maximum permissible limit for the lead content of paint at the lowest feasible level. Additional information on establishing legally binding control measures, including a Model law and guidance for regulating lead paint (available
 in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish), can be found on the UNEP website.
  Other measures include requiring the use of paint with no added lead in public buildings such as schools and hospitals, and informing the general public about the hazards of lead to encourage the purchase of paint without added lead. This market pressure
    can encourage paint manufacturers to take voluntary action to stop adding lead compounds to their products. The phase-out of leaded gasoline has shown how successful such policy measures can be. The mean population blood lead concentration in many countries has greatly decreased as a result of the banning of leaded gasoline together with other lead control
    measures. The Lead Paint Alliance is working towards the global elimination of lead paint through the adoption in all countries of legally binding laws, regulations, standards and/or procedures to control the production, import, sale and use of lead paints. This
    target gives special attention to the elimination of lead decorative paints and lead paints for other applications most likely to contribute to childhood lead exposure; however, the goal is to control lead in all paints. As of 31 May 2020, 75 countries
    had informed the Lead Paint Alliance secretariat that such control measures were in place. For further information on the status of legally binding controls see the WHO Global Health Observatory database or the UNEP Update on the global status of legal limits on lead in paint. The
phasing out of lead paint is one of the priority actions for governments included in the WHO Road map to enhance health sector engagement in the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management towards the 2020 goal and beyond.

How will the elimination of lead paint contribute to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?,"The elimination of lead paint will prevent future exposures to lead and the consequent toxic effects, as well as environmental contamination from decaying and waste lead paint. In this way it will contribute to the achievement of the following SDG targets: 3.9: By 2030 substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination.   12.4: By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment."
What is International Lead Poisoning Prevention Week?,"International Lead Poisoning Prevention Week is an initiative of the Lead Paint Alliance, and takes place every year during the last week of October. The purpose of the campaign week is to raise awareness of the need for action to address the human health
    effects of exposure to lead, especially in relation to children. A particular focus of the campaign week is to urge further action by governments, industry and consumers to eliminate lead paint.  Partners in this campaign include the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the International Pollution Elimination Network (IPEN), working together as
    part of the Lead Paint Alliance to support campaign activities, for example by producing multilingual campaign materials for use in local, regional or national campaigns. These materials are made available through the WHO website. During the week, a range of activities takes place around the world. These are organized by community groups, public health departments, academia, government departments and others. Click here for information on the week of action and to find campaign materials."
What can I do?,"One of the ways to protect yourself and your family from lead exposure is to be a careful consumer. You should try to get informed about sources of lead exposure in your community and avoid buying products that may contain lead. For example, when buying paint check the label to see if lead is mentioned. If you are not sure ask the vendor or the manufacturer about possible lead content. If you know that lead paint is not legally controlled in your country then lobby your politicians to do something about it. If you are planning to redecorate a building or to renovate painted furniture, and you think the original paint may contain lead, you should get expert advice about safe methods for removing the paint. You should also take care when buying cosmetics and traditional medicines to only buy from a regulated manufacturer, as high levels of lead have been reported in some of these products. When you buy a new car battery take the old one back to the distributor or to a licensed recycling facility, rather than dumping the battery or allowing it to be recycled at an informal or unlicensed facility."
How is WHO tackling the problem of lead and its effects on health?,"WHO has identified lead as one of ten chemicals of major public health concern that require action by Member States in order to protect the health of workers, children and women of reproductive age.  In order to raise awareness about the hazards of lead and the need for preventive action, WHO has made available through its website a range of information on lead, including information for policy makers, technical guidance and advocacy materials.  This includes information on the health aspects of recycling used lead-acid batteries (9). All WHO information on lead can be found at the following link.  To assist policy-makers, public health authorities and health professionals in implementing measures to protect the health of children and adults from lead exposure, WHO is developing evidence-based guidelines on the prevention and management of lead poisoning.  Since leaded paint is a continuing source of exposure in many countries, WHO has joined with UNEP to form the Lead Paint Alliance.  WHO is also a partner in a project funded by the Global Environment Facility that aims to support at least 40 countries in enacting legally binding controls on lead paint.The World Health Assembly, at its 69th meeting, recognised WHO’s contribution to the work of the Lead Paint Alliance, and endorsed the development of a road map for the health sector towards achieving the 2020 goal of the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management for the sound management of chemicals and waste, and contributing to the relevant targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (Resolution 69.4). The Road map to enhance health sector engagement in the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management towards the 2020 goal and beyond was subsequently approved by the 70th World Health Assembly in decision WHA70(23). This roadmap includes the phasing out of lead paint as one of the priority actions for governments."
"Why are some tropical diseases called ""neglected""?","The people who are most affected by these diseases are often 
the poorest populations, living in remote, rural areas, urban slums or 
conflict zones. Neglected tropical diseases persist under conditions of 
poverty and are concentrated almost exclusively in impoverished 
populations in the developing world. 
		Lacking a strong political voice, people affected by these 
tropical diseases have a low profile and status in public health 
priorities. Lack of reliable statistics and unpronounceable names of 
diseases have all hampered efforts to bring them out of the shadows. 
They include dengue, rabies, blinding trachoma, Buruli ulcer, endemic 
treponematoses (yaws), leprosy (Hansen disease), Chagas disease, human 
African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), leishmaniasis, 
cysticercosis, dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease), echinococcosis, 
foodborne trematode infections, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis 
(river blindness), schistosomiasis (bilharziasis), soil-transmitted 
helminthiases (intestinal worms).Neglected tropical diseases affect more than 1 billion people,
 primarily poor populations living in tropical and subtropical climates.
 They are frequently clustered together geographically and individuals 
are often afflicted with more than one parasite or infection. More than 
70% of countries and territories that report the presence of neglected 
tropical diseases are low-income or lower middle-income economies.Infections are caused by unsafe water, poor housing conditions
 and poor sanitation. Children are the most vulnerable to these 
diseases, which kill, impair or permanently disable millions of people 
every year, often resulting in life-long physical pain and social 
stigmatization. 
There is reason to be optimistic, however. Many neglected 
tropical diseases can be prevented, eliminated or even eradicated with 
improved access to existing safe and cost-effective tools. Control 
relies on simple interventions that can be carried out by 
non-specialists -- for example schoolteachers, village heads and local 
volunteers -- in community-based preventive action.

What is self-care?,"WHO’s working definition of self-care is “the ability of individuals, families and communities to promote health, prevent disease, maintain health, and to cope with illness and disability with or without the support of a healthcare provider.”"
What is the scope of self-care?,"The scope of self-care in this definition includes health promotion; disease prevention and control; selfmedication; providing care to dependent persons; seeking hospital/specialist care if necessary; and rehabilitation, including palliative care.WHO’s consolidated normative guidance includes evidence-based recommendations and good practice statements covering existing and new self-care interventions."
Is self-care new?,"Self-care is not new. For millennia people have been taking measures to prevent disease, promote health and cope with illness and disability with and without a health care provider. Today, while self care may be used by and benefit people across all strata of all societies, people in conditions of vulnerability are particularly inclined to use self-care as their primary form of healthcare. Self care aligns with the long-standing commitment of WHO to people-centered care: care that is focused and organized around the health needs and expectations of people and communities rather than on diseases. The Global Conference on Primary Health Care highlights the importance of empowering individuals as self-carers and caregivers."
Is self-care specific to SRHR?,"While self-care can be particularly effective in the field of sexual and reproductive health and rights, given the stigma and difficulties people often face accessing information and services, self care is not limited to sexual and reproductive health and rights. For example, with the increase of noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, cancers, cardiovascular and chronic lung diseases, self-care can play a vital role in preventing and reducing underlying risk factors, optimizing treatment and managing complications"
Who is self-care for?,"Self care is practiced by everyone and emerging new self-care interventions have the potential to benefit even the most vulnerable populations. In the case of self-care interventions in 2019, the WHO position is that it is essential to place emphasis on the needs of populations who may neither be aware of their right to health nor able to access the services they need. These include vulnerable, marginalized and socioeconomically underprivileged populations who have the poorest health outcomes globally."
Why produce a consolidated Guideline for self-care?,"The intention of a consolidated guideline is to recognize that many of individual interventions have commonalities. Reviewing the benefits, preferences, values, acceptability, feasibility, resource implications, equity, ethics, legal and human rights dimensions of different self-care interventions reveals they have barriers and enabling factors in common. A consolidated guideline supports health systems actors and individuals to see those commonalities from a user and health system perspective.In addition, a consolidated guideline will increase the extent to which these interventions strengthen the overall health system. The view of the WHO is that self-care interventions are still part of the health system and normative guidance will include points of interaction or linkages with the health system for accessing information, the intervention itself, or linkages to care. Self-care interventions should not be stand-alone products or cause further health system fragmentation but should rather be linked to the health system and supported by it. This will ensure that the health system remains accountable and can determine how to appropriately interact with and support implementation of self-care interventions. This interaction with the health system should maximize the positive benefits that can accrue to individuals through self care and balance this with the health system as currently configured to provide access to quality, affordable healthcare."
Why this consolidated Guideline now?,"The estimated shortage of 12.9 million healthcare workers by 2035, and an estimated 1 in 5 of the world’s population now living in humanitarian crises, point to the urgent need to find innovative strategies that go beyond a conventional health sector response.The value of self-care is not solely as a response to resource constraints. Self-care interventions can bring users greater choice, access, control, satisfaction and affordable options to manage their healthcare needs. Self care can recognize the strengths of individuals as active agents in their own health care, and not merely passive recipients of health services.In addition, the rapid evolution of technology is transforming healthcare. New diagnostics, devices, drugs and digital health are all transforming how patients and health systems interact."
Will health care providers need training to promote self care?,"Providers and other health system actors will require evidence that self care does no harm and is beneficial to health outcomes at both individual and population levels. As part of the consolidated guideline, WHO will review and generate evidence that assesses the role of providers and the competencies required in supporting self care. The evidence generated to date suggests that providers can often be the beneficiary of self care, by allowing them to serve a greater number of patients with existing resources and deploying their clinical skills where greatest need exists. Rapid change has occurred across workforces in many sectors this past 25 years and healthcare is no different. With such change comes both challenges and opportunities."

Is the term “totally drug resistant” clearly defined? Is it recognised by the WHO?,"The term “totally drug resistant” has not been clearly defined for tuberculosis. While the concept of “total drug resistance” is easily understood in general terms, in practice, in vitro drug susceptibility testing (DST) is technically challenging and limitations on the use of results remain: conventional DST for the drugs that define MDR and XDR-TB has been thoroughly studied and consensus reached on appropriate methods, critical drug concentrations that define resistance, and reliability and reproducibility of testing.[9]Data on the reproducibility and reliability of DST for the remaining SLDs are either much more limited or have not been established, or the methodology for testing does not exist.Most importantly, correlation of DST results with clinical response to treatment has not yet been adequately established. Thus, a strain of TB with in vitro DST results showing resistance could in fact, in the patient, be susceptible to these drugs.The prognostic relevance of in vitro resistance to drugs without an internationally accepted and standardised drug susceptibility test therefore remains unclear and current WHO recommendations advise against the use of these results to guide treatment.[10]Lastly, new drugs are under development, and their effectiveness against these “totally drug resistant” strains has not yet been reported.For these reasons, the term “totally drug resistant” tuberculosis is not yet recognised by the WHO. These cases are defined as extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), according to WHO definitions."
What is extensively drug resistant tuberculosis?,"Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is an even more severe form of drug resistant TB than multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). In 2006, the first reports of XDR-TB began to appear. [1,2]MDR-TB is defined as resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin, with or without resistance to other first-line drugs (FLD). XDR-TB is defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, and to any fluoroquinolone, and to any of the three second-line injectables (amikacin, capreomycin, and kanamycin). Within a year of the first reports of XDR-TB, isolated cases were reported in Europe that had resistance to all first-line anti-TB drugs (FLD) and second-line anti-TB drugs (SLD) that were tested.[3,4,5] In 2009, a cohort of 15 patients in Iran was reported which were resistant to all anti-TB drugs tested.[6]The terms “extremely drug resistant” (“XXDR-TB”) and “totally drug-resistant TB” (“TDR-TB”) were given by the respective authors reporting on this group of patients. Recently, a further 4 patients from India with “totally drug resistant” tuberculosis (“TDR-TB”) were described [7], with subsequent media reports of a further 8 cases.[8]"

How can the human rights of people with mental health conditions be promoted and protected?,"People with mental health conditions around the world are 
exposed to a wide range of human rights violations. The stigma they face
 means they are often ostracized from society and fail to receive the 
care they require or the services and support they need to lead full 
lives in the community. In some communities, people with mental health 
conditions are banished to the edge of town where they are left 
semi-naked or in rags, tied up, beaten and left to go hungry. 
		People in many mental hospitals fair little better. People 
are restrained with metal shackles, confined in caged beds, deprived of 
clothing, decent bedding, clean water or proper toilet facilities and 
are subject to abuse and neglect. People with mental health conditions also face discrimination 
on a daily basis including in the fields of education, employment and 
housing. Some countries even prohibit people from voting, marrying or 
having children."
How can these violations be prevented?,"Ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).
 The coming into force of the Convention is  a major milestone in 
efforts to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of 
all human rights of people with disabilities.  Countries should align 
their policies and laws to the Convention, ensuring that these promote 
autonomy, liberty, legal capacity, participation of people with mental 
health conditions, as well as the range of services required for 
independent community living. 
Change attitudes and raise awareness. Ministries of 
Health, organizations of people with mental health conditions, health 
professionals, NGOs including Disabled Peoples’ Organizations academic 
institutions, professional organizations and other stakeholders should 
unify their efforts in educating and changing public attitudes towards 
mental illness and in advocating for the rights of people with mental 
disorders.
Improve human rights in mental health facilities. Ways to 
assess quality of care and human rights conditions should be established
 to protect against inhuman and degrading treatment, poor living 
conditions and involuntary admission and treatment. People should be 
able to file complaints in cases of human rights violations.
Empower people with mental health conditions and their families.
 Governments should support creating and/or strengthening of 
organizations of people with mental health conditions and as well as 
family organizations. Such groups are in the best position to highlight 
problems, specify their needs, and help find solutions to prevent 
violations and improving mental health and other required services in 
countries. They have a crucial role to play in the design and 
implementation of policies, plans, laws and services.
Replace psychiatric institutions with community care. 
Large institutions, which are so often associated with human rights 
violations, should be replaced by community mental health care services,
 backed by psychiatric beds in general hospital and home care support. 
Mental health services need to link to services and supports in the 
community, enabling people with mental health conditions to enjoy 
educational, employment, social service and housing opportunities on an 
equal basis with others.
Increase investment in mental health. Governments need to 
dedicate more of their health budget to mental health. In addition the 
mental health workforce at each level of the health care system needs to
 be developed and trained to ensure that all people have access to good 
quality mental health services that promote recovery and respect for 
human rights.  
The WHO QualityRights project aims to help countries to 
achieve these goals.  The project supports governments to assess and 
improve quality and human rights conditions in mental health services. 
It alsobuilds capacity on human rights and recovery, empower people with
 mental health conditions through the strengthening of Disabled People’s
 Organizations, and  reform national policies and legislation in line 
with international human rights standards."
How concerned is WHO about the so-called “super malaria” parasite in South-East Asia?,"First, let me emphasize that the term “super malaria” has not been adequately defined; the scientific and public health community does not recognize this term.The problem of multidrug resistance in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), including in Viet Nam, has been well known to WHO for a number of years. In 2014 and 2015, 4 studies conducted by Viet Nam’s National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP), in collaboration with WHO, already demonstrated high treatment failure rates with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP)* ranging from about 26% to 46%. The Lancet letter confirms data published earlier this year by the NMCP Viet Nam and WHO and gives us a clearer picture of the genetic background of the parasites responsible for these high treatment failure rates.While we are obviously concerned by multidrug resistance in Viet Nam, we are very encouraged by 2 recent developments. First, in September 2016, Viet Nam’s NMCP changed its policy for first-line treatment of malaria, replacing DP (in provinces where DP is failing) with artesunate-mefloquine, an effective treatment against the drug-resistant strain of malaria parasites reported in the Lancet letter. Secondly, the NMCP, under the auspices of WHO, has been testing a new artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) called artesunate-pyronaridine; preliminary data show that the drug has a very high efficacy rate, even in areas in Viet Nam that contain the drug-resistant strain.Moreover, it is important to note that since 2008, when artemisinin resistance was first detected in the GMS, there has been a major decline in the rate of malaria cases and deaths. According to WHO estimates, malaria case incidence in GMS countries fell by 54% between 2012 and 2015. Malaria death rates fell by 84% over the same period. Last year, there were approximately 200 malaria deaths and less than 300 000 cases reported in the 5 GMS countries. Insufficient access to prompt diagnosis and treatment (and not drug resistance) remains the major risk factor for malaria-related deaths in this subregion.Finally, parasite resistance to antimalarial medicines is a serious problem. But we must not create unnecessary alarm. Providing timely access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment should be our primary focus. * DP, an artemisinin-based combination therapy, is the first-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in some parts of the Greater Mekong Subregion."
Some news reports claim that the drug-resistant strain of malaria parasites detected in Viet Nam cannot be killed by current antimalarial medicines. Is this accurate?,"No. The newly adopted first-line treatment in Viet Nam, artesunate-mefloquine, remains highly efficacious against this strain as does the new ACT artesunate-pyronaridine. Up until now, we have had effective treatment options for all malaria parasites that have been detected globally."
What is the likelihood that drug-resistant malaria will spread from the GMS to India and Africa?,"In December 2016, at the request of the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC), WHO’s top advisory committee for malaria, an Evidence Review Group (ERG) analysed the body of evidence on the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant P. falciparum in the GMS over the last decade. A full report of this ERG meeting is available on the WHO website as well as the subsequent endorsement of the reportby MPAC in March 2017.While the group recognized that the risk of drug-resistant malaria spreading to India and Africa cannot be discounted, the broad consensus was that drug-resistant parasites were more likely to emerge independently in other parts of the world than to spread directly from the GMS.It is difficult, however, to estimate this risk with any level of precision. In some cases, resistance to antimalarial medicines (like chloroquine) has spread to other regions. In other cases (as with mefloquine), it has not."
Could resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapies in the GMS have the same consequences that resistance to chloroquine did several decades ago?,"Again, it would be difficult to make a prediction with any high degree of confidence. However, there are several important considerations to bear in mind.First, when chloroquine resistance emerged in Africa in the 1980s, malaria control across the continent was very limited. As an example, the proportion of the population sleeping under a bednet was less than 1%.Fortunately, since then, the malaria landscape has changed dramatically. With the massive roll-out of effective vector control,* improved case management through diagnostics and combination therapies, improvements to health systems, increased monitoring of drug efficacy and clear guidance on policy changes, the consequences of drug-resistant malaria – should it ever reach India or Africa – are likely to be less severe today than those observed with chloroquine in the 1980s.Secondly, we expect that – with investments in research and development – new tools, including new medicines, will enable us to overcome the challenge of multidrug resistance in the Greater Mekong Subregion. * According to the World Malaria Report 2016, nearly 60% of the population in Africa is now protected from malaria through either insecticide-treated nets or indoor residual spraying."
Does WHO consider the threat of antimalarial drug resistance a public health emergency of international concern?,"Not at this time. A public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), as defined in the International Health Regulations (IHR), is an “extraordinary event.” These regulations were designed to address acute (as opposed to chronic) public health conditions. The public health community has known of the emergence and spread of multidrug resistance in this subregion for many years and is addressing it through the work of national malaria control and elimination programmes.Meeting in both 2012 and 2014, the Technical Expert Group on Drug Resistance and Containment concluded that artemisinin resistance does not constitute a PHEIC because the conditions for PHEIC are not met. These conclusions were endorsed by MPAC."
What is WHO doing to stop the spread of antimalarial drug resistance in the Greater Mekong?,"WHO has coordinated and led global efforts to counter artemisinin resistance from the very beginning, providing technical guidance and mobilizing partners to action. In 2013, WHO launched the Emergency response to artemisinin resistance (ERAR) in the Greater Mekong Subregion, a high-level plan of attack to contain the spread of drug-resistant parasites and to provide life-saving tools for all populations at risk of malaria.In 2015, GMS Ministers of Health adopted the WHO Strategy for malaria elimination in the Greater Mekong Subregion (2015-2030). The plan aims to eliminate P. falciparum malaria from the subregion by 2025 and all species of human malaria by 2030. Priority action is targeted to areas where multidrug resistant malaria has taken root. This subregional strategy is fully aligned with the goals and targets of the WHO Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2015.With technical guidance from WHO, all GMS countries have developed national malaria elimination plans. Providing access to prevention, diagnosis and treatment for all populations at risk of malaria is a key priority. Monitoring drug efficacy and strengthening surveillance systems are other core elements of our work. Other priorities in this subregional effort are described in detail in a report published last November.WHO’s work in the GMS is a collaborative effort involving technical teams based at 6 country offices, at regional offices in New Delhi and Manila, at a special regional hub in Phnom Penh, and at WHO’s Geneva headquarters. It is a unique initiative in view of the human resources deployed and the level of integration across many layers of the Organization.WHO is leading the elimination effort in the GMS with the support of a number of partners, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis & Malaria, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, USAID, and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.We are winning the battle. We are on the right track. The massive reductions in disease and death reported in GMS countries are a testament to the sustained progress that has been achieved along the path toward elimination in this subregion. It is only through eliminating this parasite that we will do away – once and for all – with the problem of drug resistance in this subregion.Drug resistance in the Greater Mekong Subregion: a brief historyThe GMS has long been the epicentre of antimalarial drug resistance. Parasites resistant to chloroquine were first detected in the late 1950s along the Cambodia–Thailand border. Resistance of P. falciparum malaria parasites to artemisinin was first confirmed along the Cambodia–Thailand border in 2008. To date, artemisinin resistance has been detected in 5 countries of the GMS: Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam.Resistance to ACT partner drugs has also emerged in some areas of the GMS. Treatment failure with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) was reported in Cambodia as early as 2009 and, more recently, in Lao PDR. Four studies conducted by Viet Nam’s NMCP in 2014 and 2015 demonstrated high treatment failure rates for the drug DP.When artemisinin resistance was first confirmed along the Cambodia–Thailand border in 2008, WHO took immediate action to contain its spread. A coordinated regional effort to eliminate malaria transmission in the GMS is critical to protecting the efficacy of existing antimalarial medicines.Key definitions: ACTs and artemisinin resistanceArtemisinin and its derivatives are very effective medicines known for their ability to swiftly reduce the number of parasites in the blood of patients with malaria. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are recommended by WHO as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Over the last 15 years, expanded access to ACTs in malaria-endemic countries has played an important role in reducing the global burden of malaria.ACTs combine artemisinin with one of several partner drugs. The role of artemisinin is to dramatically reduce the number of parasites in the bloodstream during the first 3 days of treatment. The role of the partner drug is to eliminate any remaining parasites thereafter.Artemisinin resistance is defined as a delay in the clearance of parasites from the bloodstream following treatment with an ACT. Currently, most patients with delayed parasite clearance are still cured by ACTs provided the partner drug remains effective. As such, protecting the efficacy of artemisinin and its partner drugs is critically important."

How do I protect my health in a flood?,"Since floods can potentially increase the transmission of water- and vector-borne diseases, such as typhoid fever, cholera, malaria, and yellow fever, among others, it is important to know your risk and protect your water sources. The most common risks associated with flooding is the contamination of drinking-water facilities, and standing water, which can be a breeding site for mosquitoes, bring chemical hazards, and cause injuries.
Protect your health during a flood by:

Knowing your community’s evacuation route and warning signals, and identifying areas prone to flooding or landslides.
Chlorinating or boiling all water for drinking and food preparation
    Ensuring uninterrupted provision of safe drinking water is the most important preventive measure to be implemented following flooding, in order to reduce the risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases.
    
Promoting good hygienic practices and safe food preparation techniques
    Do not use flood water to wash dishes, brush teeth or wash and prepare food. Always wash your hands with soap and water if you have been in contact with floodwater.
Avoiding walking or driving through flooded areas and standing water.
    Even the smallest amount of water can bring about significant dangers. You do not know if electrical lines have fallen in the water or hazardous chemicals exist. Cars and people can easily be swept away during a flood.
    
Throwing away any food that has come in contact with floodwater.
    If your food has touched any floodwater, it is not safe to eat and increases your risk of water-borne diseases.
    
Safely cleaning your home if it has come in contact with floodwater.
    Throw out any items that cannot be washed and cleaned with bleach, such as pillows and mattresses. Clean all walls, floors and other surfaces with soap and water, as well as bleach.
    
Protect against mosquitos
    If your home is in an area with stagnant or standing water, use mosquito repellent, following the instructions on the label, and apply it to clothes or skin. Also wear trousers and long-sleeved shirts, and cover beds with mosquito nets when sleeping.

Five Keys to Safer Food"
What is lymphatic filariasis?,"Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, is a painful and profoundly disfiguring parasitic disease. In communities where the parasite is transmitted, all ages are affected. While the infection may be acquired during childhood its visible manifestations may occur later in life, causing temporary or permanent disability. In endemic countries, lymphatic filariasis has a major social and economic impact."
What causes lymphatic filariasis?,"The disease is caused by three species of thread-like nematode worms, known as filariae – Wuchereria bancrofti (responsible of 90% of the cases), Brugia malayi and Brugia timori. Male worms are about 3–4 centimetres in length, and female worms 8–10 centimetres. The male and female worms together form “nests” in the human lymphatic system, the network of nodes and vessels that maintain the delicate fluid balance between blood and body tissues. The lymphatic system is an essential component of the body’s immune system."
How is the parasite transmitted?,"Adult male and female worms lodge in the lymphatics. Fecund females release larvae (microfilaria) which periodically circulate in the blood. Microfilaria circulating in the blood can be ingested by feeding mosquito vectors. Microfilaria must mature in the vector before becoming infective. The mosquitoes can then spread infective larvae to new hosts when feeding.The major vectors of W. bancrofti are mosquitoes of the genus Culex (in urban and semi-urban areas), Anopheles (in rural areas of Africa and elsewhere) and Aedes (in islands of the Pacific)."
Where is lymphatic filariasis most commonly found?,"An estimated 120 million people in tropical and subtropical areas of the world are infected with lymphatic filariasis. Of the total population requiring preventative chemotherapy to interrupt the transmission cycle, 57% live in the South-East Asia Region (9 countries) and 37% live in the African Region (35 countries)."
What are the signs and symptoms of lymphatic filariasis?,"Filarial infection can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including lymphoedema of the limbs, genital disease (hydrocele, chylocele, and swelling of the scrotum and penis) and recurrent acute attacks, which are extremely painful and are accompanied by fever. The vast majority of infected people are asymptomatic, but virtually all of them have subclinical lymphatic damage and as many as 40% have kidney damage, with proteinuria and haematuria."
How is lymphatic filariasis diagnosed?,There are two methods to diagnose the disease. One can either detect the presence of circulating microfilariae in the blood by examining thick smears (20–60 μl) of finger-prick blood. Blood must be collected at a specific time – either at night or during the day – depending on the periodicity of the microfilariae.The second possibility is to detect Wuchereria bancrofti (the parasite) antigen in human blood samples using the rapid diagnostic test Alere Filariasis Test Strip.
Can lymphatic filariasis be cured?,"All people with filariasis who have microfilaraemia or a positive antigen test should receive antifilarial drug treatment to eliminate microfilariae. Unfortunately, the medicines available have limited effect on adult worms. Treatment also requires managing morbidity and preventing disabilities for affected people."
Can lymphatic filariasis be prevented?,Avoidance of mosquito bites through personal protection measures or community-level vector control and participation in MDA (Mass Drug Administration) at the community level is the best option to prevent lymphatic filariasis.The primary goal of treating affected communities is to eliminate microfilariae from the blood of infected individuals in order to interrupt transmission of infection by mosquitoes. Studies have shown that > 5 years of MDA with preventive chemotherapy reduces microfilariae from the bloodstream and prevents the spread of microfilariae to mosquitoes.
What is the difference between lymphatic filariasis and podoconiosis?,"Podoconiosis is a type of tropical lymphoedema clinically distinguished from lymphatic filariasis through being ascending and commonly bilateral but asymmetric. Evidence suggests that podoconiosis is the result of a genetically determined abnormal inflammatory reaction to mineral particles in irritant red clay soils derived from volcanic deposits. It is a non-parasitic disease.It is mostly found in highland areas of tropical Africa, Central America and north-west India. Like lymphatic filariasis, podoconiosis results in impairments due to lymphoedema. As is the case for lymphatic filariasis, a basic package of care can alleviate suffering and prevent further progression of disease and disability."
What is guinea worm? Is it a real worm?,"Guinea worm is, in fact, a real worm. It is a large nematode, Dracunculus medinensis, which is ingested through drinking contaminated water.  This worm is the largest of the tissue parasite affecting humans. The adult female, which carries about 3 million embryos, can measure 600 to 800 mm in length and 2 mm in diameter. The parasite migrates through the victim's subcutaneous tissues causing severe pain especially when it occurs in the joints. The worm eventually emerges (from the feet in most of the cases), causing an intensely painful oedema, a blister and an ulcer accompanied by fever, nausea and vomiting."
How does Guinea-worm disease spread?,"Infected persons try to relieve the burning sensation by immersing the infected part of their body in local water sources, usually ponds water. This also induces a contraction of the female worm at the base of the ulcer causing the sudden expulsion of hundreds of thousands of first stage larvae into the water. They move actively in the water, where they can live for a few days.
For further development, these larvae need to be ingested by suitable species of voracious predatory crustacean, Cyclops or water fleas which measure 1–2 mm and widely abundant worldwide. In the cyclops, larvae develop to infective third-stage in 14 days at 26°C.
When a person drinks contaminated water from ponds or shallow open wells, the cyclops is dissolved by the gastric acid of the stomach and the larvae are released and migrate through the intestinal wall. After 100 days, the male and female meet and mate. The male becomes encapsulated and dies in the tissues while the female moves down the muscle planes. After about one year of the infection, the female worm emerges usually from the feet releasing thousands of larvae thus repeating the life cycle."
How can Guinea-worm disease be prevented?,"Several measures should be followed to curtail transmissionof the disease:

Effective surveillance to detect all cases within 24 hours of worm emergence and containment of all cases;
Ensuring access to safe drinking water and converting unsafe sources to safe ones;
The construction of copings around well heads or the installation of boreholes with handpumps. This would prevent not only dracunculiasis but also diarrhoeal diseases.
Regular and systematic filtering of drinking water derived from ponds and shallow unprotected wells or from surface water. Finely-meshed cloth or, better still, a filter made from a 0.15 mm nylon mesh, is all that is needed to filter out the cyclops from the drinking water;
Treatment of unsafe water sources with temephos to kill the cyclops;
Health education and social mobilization to encourage affected communities to adopt healthy drinking water behaviour."
Where is Guinea-worm disease found?,"The epidemiology of the disease is determined largely by the use of open stagnant water sources such as ponds and sometimes shallow or step wells. Man-made ponds are the main source of transmission.
Guinea-worm disease is seasonal, occurring with two broad patterns found in endemic areas of Africa, depending on climatic factors.
In the Sahelian zone, transmission generally occurs in the rainy season (May to August).
In the humid savanna and forest zone, the peak occurs in the dry season (September to January).
However, there are local variations in these patterns. Other risk factors are mobility and infection having occurred the previous year."
Is Guinea-worm disease fatal?,"Guinea-worm disease is rarely fatal. Frequently, however, the patient remains sick for several months, mainly because:

The emergence of the worm, sometimes several, is accompanied by painful oedema, intense generalised pruritus, blistering and an ulceration of the area from which the worm emerges.
The migration and emergence of the worms occur in sensitive parts of the body, sometimes the articular spaces can lead to permanent disability.
Ulcers caused by the emergence of the worm invariably develop secondary bacterial infections which exacerbate inflammation and pain resulting in temporary disability ranging from a few weeks to a few months.
Accidental rupture of the worm in the tissue spaces can result in serious allergic reactions.

Temporary disability can leave many patients unable to leave their beds for a month during and after the emergence of the worm. This usually occurs during the peak agricultural activities and when labour is in a great demand."
What are soil-transmitted helminths (STH)?,"Helminth is a technical name for worm.There are 3 species of STH which are particularly critical in terms of public health: Roundworm, Whipworm and Hookworm."
How do I get soil-transmitted helminths (STH)?,"A person who is infected with STH has parasite eggs in their faeces.In areas where there is no proper latrine system, the soil around the village or living area becomes contaminated with faeces containing these worm eggs.In the soil the eggs mature: this takes from between 2 and 4 weeks. They can then infect humans in two ways:eggs stick to vegetables grown in the area. If the vegetables are not carefully cooked, washed or peeled, the eggs are ingested and infect the person;young children often play in the soil and put their hands in their mouths without washing them. In this way they ingest the eggs and become infected.You can also become infected by:drinking unclean water which has STH eggs in it;>walking barefoot on contaminated soil. The eggs hatch into larvae which can penetrate the skin of people walking barefoot (this is only true for hookworms)."
How do I avoid getting STH?,"Drink clean water and wash, cook or peel food carefully before eating it.

Wash your hands before eating.Wear shoes. There is no direct person-to-person transmission, or infection from fresh faeces, because eggs passed in faeces need about 3 weeks to mature in the soil before they become infective."
What are the symptoms of STH?,"Most of the symptoms of STH infections are very nonspecific and 
only become evident when the infection is particularly severe. The 
nonspecific symptoms include nausea, tiredness, abdominal pain and loss 
of appetite.Sometimes you will see worms in your faeces."
What are the health problems caused by STH?,"Anaemia: Hookworms live in the intestine. They attach 
themselves to the intestine wall and feed on blood from the cut vessels 
and mucosal tissues. This blood loss causes anaemia.Vitamin A deficiency: Worms need vitamin A to live. In 
many countries, people do not eat enough vitamin A-rich foods. In these 
situations, the limited amount of vitamin A that is eaten is taken by 
the worms.Learning: Worm infected children are less able to concentrate or memorize information. They score less well in school tests.Intestinal obstruction: If a person is constantly infected
 over a long period of time, the number of worms in that person's 
intestine steadily increases. Eventually the number of worms can become 
so great that they block the intestine and the only option at that stage
 is surgery. This is usually the case for small children whose 
intestines are still relatively narrow."
"If I think I have STH, how do I treat them?","Treatment is very simple and safe.Take one dose of any of the following four drugs.If you live in an area where worms are a problem, it is a good idea to treat yourself regularly (e.g twice a year).  
 Dose by age 1−2 years2 years upwardsAlbendazole (400 mg tablet)1/2 tablet1 tabletMebendazole (500 mg tablet)1 tablet
 Dose by age 1−5 years1−12 years12 years upwardsLevamisole (40 mg tablet)2.5mg/kg2 tablets2.5mg/kgPyrantel (250 mg tablet)10mg/kg"
"If I am pregnant, is it safe to take the drugs?","Yes, the drugs are safe and WHO recommends that if you have worms, you should be treated, even if you are pregnant.As a general precaution, WHO recommendations state that all drugs should be taken after the first trimester"
"I am going on holiday to a country where I think worms are a problem, should I be concerned ?","First, you can easily avoid getting schistosomiasis by not swimming in fresh water in areas where schistosomiasis is likely to occur.Second, worms (both schistosomes and soil-transmitted helminths 
(STHs) do not cause a life-threatening disease for someone who is 
generally healthy and then becomes infected. The disease is only serious
 for people living in endemic areas who become constantly reinfected and
 have no access treatment.Third, if you get infected, the treatment is easy and safe."
Why has WHO published these new Guidelines for malaria vector control?,"Over the decades, WHO has produced a large amount of valuable literature on malaria vector control, but it can be very difficult to navigate and to identify which information is the most up-to-date, or how different recommendations and guidance link together.These guidelines aim to overcome this challenge and simplify life for everyone involved in malaria vector control by creating a “one-stop shop” where all WHO key recommendations in this field are consolidated. And just as importantly, the guidelines are meant to greatly increase the transparency around the level of available evidence on which the WHO guidance is based.The ultimate goal of these guidelines is to ensure the best use of available resources for malaria vector control founded on a solid evidence base."
Why do the new guidelines contain a mix of recommendations and good practice statements?,"We decided to bring recommendations and good practice statements all together in one document, as these complement each other.Recommendations are generally based on systematic reviews of evidence generated by randomized controlled trials and other rigorously designed and implemented studies. For example, a considerable number of trials have generated solid evidence that using insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) will reduce malaria in the geographic area where they are deployed. Based on this evidence, ITNs are recommended as a core intervention for malaria control. The recommendations tell people ""what to do"" – i.e. what intervention works.The best practice statements are more about ""how to""; they are largely based on expert opinion and field experience, as the evidence around them tends to not be generated by randomized trials. Using the example of ITNs, a best practice statement is that users should be educated not to wash their nets in fresh water bodies or use them for fishing as we know that pyrethroids used on the nets are very toxic to aquatic organisms."
What impact do you expect the guidelines to have for those implementing malaria vector control programmes?,"By making the recommendations more user-friendly, I think people will be more receptive to using them. I hope the guidelines make it much easier for national malaria control programmes and implementing partners not only to develop evidence-based vector control policies and strategies, but also to understand how specific tools should be deployed according to specific circumstances.By pulling together the ""what to do"" and the ""how to do it"" in one publication, countries will be better able to adapt their efforts to a particular malaria landscape. This will ultimately strengthen the link between the data that countries generate through their own research, including trials, their monitoring and surveillance activities (e.g. of insecticide resistance) and the use of this data in decision-making."
Do these guidelines contain new recommendations?,"The guidelines are largely a consolidation of existing recommendations as opposed to new ones. However, by bringing together more than 20 individual sets of WHO recommendations into one ""go-to"" document and combining them with best practice statements, it becomes a lot clearer what the key messages are in malaria vector control and how they all link together.As part of the guideline development process, the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group also conducted new systematic reviews or updated existing ones. This has provided the foundation for new – or at least clearer – recommendations. An example of this concerns the use of space spraying of insecticides, where it is made clear in the guidelines that this intervention should not be undertaken for malaria vector control."
The guidelines contain some strong recommendations based on low-certainty evidence. How is that possible?,"There are a number of reasons why there may be insufficient or poor data available on the effectiveness of certain interventions. The limited number of trials on IRS, and hence the weak evidence base for this intervention, provides a good example. Here we are dealing with an intervention that was first introduced over 50 years ago, at a time when the process to develop WHO recommendations and the associated evidence requirements had not been defined.Subsequently, a lot of operational experience has been gained that supports the use of this intervention, but randomized controlled trials aimed at generating gold standard evidence to establish the efficacy of this intervention are few and far between. In such cases, the development of WHO guidance relies to a considerable extent on lower quality evidence and expert opinion. In the formulation of recommendations, experts will also consider several factors other than data-based trials and studies, including:balance of benefit and harm;the values and preferences of individuals and populations affected by the recommendation (i.e. what importance people assign to the outcomes associated with the intervention);the acceptability of the intervention to the most important stakeholders, as well as feasibility and resource implications."
Are there implications for innovators and research partners?,"Absolutely. I believe the new document helps increase the level of transparency around the evidence that underpins WHO recommendations, and hence on the process that needs to be followed to generate an evidence base that allows WHO to develop or revise recommendations on vector control.Through greater transparency, we hope that innovators and research partners will understand why new tools and interventions need to be fully evaluated. After all, in the resource-constrained environment that most malaria-endemic countries operate in, the choice of a vector control intervention will come at the cost of something else, so prioritizing one over the other needs to be well justified. We really want all malaria stakeholders to recognize the benefits of conducting solid research which, in turn, generates an evidence base from which WHO can develop recommendations.In addition, the intensive process of putting together a comprehensive evidence base for these guidelines has helped to identify where there are evidence gaps, and this will help to inform the research agenda for the ongoing development of the guidelines."
How will you ensure the guidelines stay up-to-date with developments in the malaria vector control landscape?,"We see the Guidelines for malaria vector control as a ""living document"". They are very much a work in progress and will continually take into account new tools, new evidence, and new guidance. We plan to update the guidelines on an ongoing basis; the document will only be made available in a web-based format so that it can be revised as soon as new evidence is assessed by WHO.In parallel, we aim to continue improving and clarifying how new tools are evaluated, and we will continue to look for opportunities to make the evaluation process more nimble. We are also seeking input from people using the guidelines. We really want to emphasize that in order for these guidelines to be as good as possible, we do need to have people’s feedback and willingness to contribute towards them.For this purpose, we have set up a dedicated email address to which feedback can be directed:[email protected]. We will also be proactively collecting user feedback through other means, including regular user surveys."
