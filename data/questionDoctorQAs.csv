i get spinal injections for pain relief but i still have terrible pain?,in my opinion you can not go further with analgesics without treating the cause. mri for the back and neck must be done. yii could be having complicated disc lesions that need either surgical treatment or long term rest with physiotherapy. these days relax and avoid any movement other than eating and toileting. keep on hot packs and do not move until you see another orthopedist. actually i do not support localized spinal injections and steroids as they are symptomatic treatment.

i had a bad fall pain is still the same?,in my opinion it is just severe bruises but does not seem fractured or injured further. if you can walk no swelling in foot or distal to the injury site it would be bruising only…but you seem obese and this can explain the cause of exaggerated pain as you may have had formerly osteoarthritis in the knee that can be aggravated and show up with a fall like that one. i recommend treating the bruising with ice application and elevation. use an anti bruising cream. then do a knee plain xray from standing position. regards
i had a bad fall pain is still the same?,hi in my opinion haematoma caused by contusion gets drained downwards or to the back of the knee before it goes away. also i think you should have a knee mri such a strong fall could have cracked patella or injured the meniscus. (see a doctor) good luck
i had a bad fall pain is still the same?,hi such big bruise needs to be investigated for sure. u cannot just wait for the bruise to go away on its own. i would suggest a orthopedist opinion and a xray of the knee and leg done. a mri of knee may be needed if the xray does not confirm the diagnosis. thanks
i had a bad fall pain is still the same?,its very nice to try to handle your pain. but really need to investigate at least by doing the basics just to be in the samw side do x rayb consult a doctor cause u may have fracture or may be ms strain. also there may be inflammation so u need to take pain killers and anti inflammatory drugs. let me ask you are u diabetic?

my uterus is retroverted and retroflexed my doctor doesn’t want to refer me to a specialist?,retroversion and retroflexion can be corrected by stretching and yoga. massage if it is of a low degree …so i don’t know the point of your doctor of refusing that. normally if it is not causing any problem i think massage and yoga if they did not help they will not harm.
my uterus is retroverted and retroflexed my doctor doesn’t want to refer me to a specialist?,hi your doctor does not believe that massage can fix retroversion of uterus actully specifically in your case with both retroverion and retroflextion i would go with correction surgery not arvigo therapist.

my grandfather passed away at hospital choked on food?,i am so sorry for your loss. in my opinion he would have many possibilities. ards may have happened after his stroke that has caused bulbar symptoms. this could have lead to aspiration of some food that caused spesis in the lung causing ards. but although ards is a life threatening case i think it was not the direst cause of death. i think he may has had stroke (heart ) due to bed stay and ards and this was the cause of arrest.
my grandfather passed away at hospital choked on food?,hi many questions here. where was the last stroke (location in brain)? did he ever have a pulmonary embolism or chest pain? actully ards can happen with certain brain injuries however if they were able to revive him then you can not assume he chocked on food. good luck

i’ve had this off balance/unsteady feeling in my head doctors are clueless?,this is commonly occuring with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (bppv) is caused by a problem in the inner ear. tiny calcium “stones” inside your inner ear canals help you keep your balance. normally when you move a certain way such as when you stand up or turn your head these stones move around. but things like infection or inflammation can stop the stones from moving as they should. this sends a false message to your brain and causes the vertigo. i̇t can be treated by positioning exercises at a professional physotehra post or neurologist. regards

i am under doctors care but i feel like i need a second opinion?,hi if you have no time to wait for blood thinners to work then you can ask your doctor to preform a catheter-directed thrombolysis if this does not work then your only option will be surgical removalgood luck
i am under doctors care but i feel like i need a second opinion?,actually if i were your doctor i would choose surgical treatment. then work on the main cause of your problem. for example lose extra weight drink plenty of water. take your blood thinners and any other cause your doctor believe from your history is causing it.

found thyroid nodule is cnb the correct method to determine if benign or malignant?,clinically it is well known that malignancy of thyroid is very very rare and specially in your age. most thyroid nodules are benign. so doing further tests without treating the problem itself (big sized atypical nodule) whether it is benign or malignant. is a waste of time and more complications. for me. i think you can get the ultrasound done once more and if there is a change in size or the hormones in blood then you can go directly for surgery to prevent its manifestations and complications on your body. thanks.
found thyroid nodule is cnb the correct method to determine if benign or malignant?,hi this needs to be confirmed and the best method for doing this is cnb. its a simple procedure and causes very less pain. the tissue that is removed through cnb is sent for histopathology and confirmed for malignancy. this is “the ” confirmatory test. thanks

my son believes his thoughts are broadcasted and read by everyone?,hi. i certainly would go for the 1st option as he seems to be almost alright now apart from the fact that he thinks his thoughts are being read by everyone. any medicine will have no impact on this symptom and this will only go away with his age and the experiences he will have in his life. he just need counselling and moral support from you all for the coming few years. these symptoms we generally see due to gross hormonal changes that occur in this age and will gradually sttle down in a few years from now. thanks
my son believes his thoughts are broadcasted and read by everyone?,thought broadcasting and reading is a symptom of schizophrenia (clozapine is used to treat schizophrenia). so i think your doctor believes your son has schizophrenia. i myself would go to option 2. i think a sickness like schizophrenia is treated good using s a mix of antipsychotic medication and counselling.
my son believes his thoughts are broadcasted and read by everyone?,the side effects of antipsychotics are sometimes worse than the disease itself. i would choose no drugs and choose therapy – u should look into cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt)

fell down cracked head – arms and legs now feeling numb?,hi. it is not good to get numbness generally in your arms and legs it could be just due to a blunt for your cervical region or a cervical disc injury or may be due to a more serious case in the brain. so you have to check your self for the following first 1-brain ct and xray to make sure there is no subarachnoid hemorrhage or direct head injury. if not then do an xray for cervical region
